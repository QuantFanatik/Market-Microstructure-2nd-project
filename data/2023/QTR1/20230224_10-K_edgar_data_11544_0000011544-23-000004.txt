PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property casualty insurance business: 
 
 Insurance - Our Insurance business underwrite predominantly commercial insurance business, including excess and surplus lines, admitted lines and specialty personal lines throughout the United States, as well as insurance business in Asia, Australia, Canada, Continental Europe, Mexico, Scandinavia, South America and the United Kingdom. 
 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess - Our Reinsurance businesses provide facultative and treaty reinsurance in the United States, as well as in the Asia Pacific region, Australia, Continental Europe, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Monoline Excess businesses retain risk solely on an excess basis. 
 Our two reporting segments are each composed of individual businesses that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or industry served. Each of our businesses is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge. This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our businesses to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and specific customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support. 
 Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities. New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business. Of our 59 businesses, 52 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition. 
 Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), for each of our reporting segments for each of the past three years were as follows: 
 
 Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Net premiums written: Insurance 8,784,146 7,743,814 6,347,101 Reinsurance Monoline Excess 1,219,924 1,119,053 915,336 Total 10,004,070 8,862,867 7,262,437 Percentage of net premiums written: Insurance 87.8 87.4 87.4 Reinsurance Monoline Excess 12.2 12.6 12.6 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 
 Thirty-two of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") and have financial strength ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: A Best's Financial Strength Rating (FSR) is an independent opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. An FSR is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk. A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change. 
 Our twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard Poor's S P have financial strength ratings of A + (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings). 
 Our Moody's financial strength ratings are A1 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the fifth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings). 
 Our twenty-five insurance company subsidiaries rated by Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") have insurer financial strength ratings of AA- (the fourth highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).

The following sections describe our reporting segments and their businesses in greater detail. These businesses underwrite on behalf of one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group. The businesses are identified for descriptive purposes only and are not legal entities, but for marketing purposes may sometimes be referred to individually as "a Berkley company" or collectively as "Berkley companies." Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to Berkley, we, us, our, the Company or similar terms refer to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries and businesses. W. R. Berkley Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1970. 
 Insurance 
 Our U.S.-based businesses predominantly underwrite commercial insurance business primarily throughout the United States, although many units offer coverage globally, focusing on the following general areas: 
 Excess Surplus Lines : A number of our businesses are dedicated to the U.S. excess and surplus lines market. They serve a diverse group of customers that often have complex risk or unique exposures that typically fall outside the underwriting guidelines of the standard insurance market. Lines of business underwritten by our excess and surplus lines businesses include premises operations, commercial automobile, property, products liability, general liability and professional liability lines. Products are generally distributed through wholesale agents and brokers. 
 Industry Specialty : Certain other businesses focus on providing specialty coverages to customers within a particular industry that are best served by underwriters and claims professionals with specialized knowledge of that industry. They offer multiple lines of business with policies tailored to address the unique exposures of these industries, often with the flexibility of providing coverages on either an admitted or a non-admitted basis in the U.S., as well as internationally. Each business delivers its products through one or more distribution channels, including retail and wholesale agents, brokers, and managing general agents (MGAs), depending on the customer and the particular risks insured. 
 Product Specialty : Other businesses specialize in providing specific lines of insurance coverage, such as workers compensation or professional liability, to a wide range of customers. They offer insurance products, analytical tools and risk management services such as loss control and claims management that enable clients to manage their risk appropriately. Business is typically written on an admitted basis, although some businesses may offer non-admitted products in the U.S. and offer products internationally. Independent agents and brokers are the primary means of distribution. 
 Regional: Certain businesses offer standard insurance products and services focused on meeting the specific needs of a geographically differentiated customer base. Key clients are small-to-midsized businesses. These regionally focused businesses provide a broad array of commercial insurance products to customers primarily in 45 states and the District of Columbia and have developed expertise in niches that reflect local economies. They are organized geographically in order to provide them with the flexibility to adapt quickly to local market conditions and customer needs.

 Loss and Loss Expense Reserves 
 To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer s payment of that loss. 
 In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported IBNR to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided. 
 In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed. 
 The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed. 
 Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company s financial statements represent management s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers compensation reserves. The amount of workers compensation reserves that were discounted was 1,267 million and 1,387 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was 416 million and 452 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, discount rates by year ranged from 0.7 to 6.5 , with a weighted average discount rate of 3.4 . 
 Substantially all discounted workers compensation reserves (97 of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022) are excess workers compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company s loss payout experience. 
 The Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers compensation reserves (representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. 
 To date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company s operations, because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language. 
 The Company s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to environmental and asbestos claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was 20 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

 Reinsurance 
 We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent) or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of A- (Excellent) or better with at least 1 billion in policyholder surplus . 
 
 Regulation 
 U.S. Regulation 
 Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by their domiciliary state insurance departments and are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the other U.S. jurisdictions in which they do business. As of January 1, 2023, there are six domiciliary states related to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview . Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than our excess and surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and 
 17 

surplus lines and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation. 
 
 Legislative and Regulatory Activity Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, legislators in several states and in the United States Congress introduced proposals that would have mandated insurance coverage for certain pandemic-related losses, including business interruption losses, under previously-issued policies that were not designed or priced to provide such coverage. Federal lawmakers also discussed the possibility of a public-private partnership, and there appears to have been a broadly held and bipartisan consensus that pandemic risk is generally uninsurable absent some kind of publicly-funded backstop. While these state and federal proposals have not meaningfully progressed, there remains a risk that they might be revived, or that future variants of COVID-19 or concerns about the possibility of a future pandemic might prompt similar legislative and regulatory proposals. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our results of operations, and is expected to continue and therefore may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 
 Holding Company Statutes . In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10 of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate domiciliary state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. 
 We must also annually submit to the lead state regulator for our group an enterprise risk management report which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our U.S. licensed insurers. 
 In addition, all states have adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize U.S. insurance regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. In November 2019, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors IAIS ), an international standard setter, adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups, as discussed below under International Regulation. This framework includes a risk-based, group-wide global insurance capital standard ICS ), which is undergoing a five-year monitoring period that started in January 2020. 
 In the United States, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the NAIC has developed a group capital calculation tool that uses a risk-based capital aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure. In 2020, the NAIC adopted amendments to the model holding company act and regulation that implement the group capital calculation by requiring the ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to holding company registration to file the group capital calculation with its lead state regulator. The annual filing requirement will become effective once the states have adopted the NAIC holding company amendments. This annual filing requirement became effective in Delaware, our lead state insurance regulator, on February 7, 2022. 
 All states have adopted the NAIC's Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the ORSA Model Act ), which requires an insurance holding company system s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report ORSA Report ). The ORSA Report is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Under the ORSA Model Act, as enacted by the states, we are required to: 
 regularly, no less than annually, conduct an ORSA to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework, and current and estimated projected future solvency position; 
 internally document the process and results of the assessment; and 
 provide an ORSA Report annually to the State of Delaware's Insurance Commissioner. 
 Cybersecurity Regulations. New York s cybersecurity regulation applies to financial services institutions authorized by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the NYDFS ), including our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The regulation requires these entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program reasonably designed to protect consumers private data and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the licensee s information systems. In November 2022, the NYDFS proposed amendments to New York s cybersecurity regulation, which, if adopted, would require additional reporting, governance and oversight measures to be implemented. 
 
 18 

The NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the Cybersecurity Model Law for consideration by state legislatures, which, when adopted by the states, establishes standards for data security, the investigation of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information, and reporting to insurance commissioners. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes significant regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. As of December 31, 2022, the Cybersecurity Model Law, or a form thereof, had been adopted by several states, including three of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries domiciliary states. A drafting note in the Cybersecurity Model Law states that a licensee s compliance with New York's cybersecurity regulation is intended to constitute compliance with the Cybersecurity Model Law, but compliance remains a state-by-state issue and we would need to consider any differences in implementation and enforcement of the Cybersecurity Model Law as part of our compliance efforts. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission amended the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Rules (otherwise known as the Safeguards Rule in 2021 to require covered financial institutions to implement certain data security measures and practices in their information security programs. Many of the requirements of the amended Safeguards Rule are similar to New York's cybersecurity regulation and the Cybersecurity Model Law, but there are some differences that may impose increased operational burdens and compliance costs. The amended Safeguards Rule will become effective in June 2023. 
 Certain other states are also developing or have developed regulations related to privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), which became effective in January 2020, broadly regulates the collection, processing and disclosure of California residents personal information, imposes limits on the sale of personal information and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances. The CCPA also established a private right of action, with potentially significant statutory damages, whereby businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information could be liable to affected consumers. California subsequently enacted the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), which came into full effect in January 2023. The CPRA amends the CCPA by imposing additional limitations and obligations with respect to covered businesses use and sharing of certain personal data. Compliance with the CCPA/CPRA may increase the cost of providing our products and services in California. Other states have considered and some states have adopted - similar proposals. For instance, Virginia enacted a data privacy law in 2021 that became effective in January 2023. Additionally, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have enacted data privacy laws that will come into effect later in 2023. These laws establish in those states many of the same data privacy and security requirements as other existing laws, such as the CCPA. 
 We cannot predict the impact, if any, that any current, proposed or future federal or state cybersecurity laws or regulations will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Risk-Based Capital Requirements . The NAIC utilizes a Risk-Based Capital RBC formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the calculated RBC target level as of December 31, 2022. 
 Insurance Regulatory Information System. The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios for property and casualty insurers referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System IRIS ). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios. 
 Guaranty Funds . Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds in states where we transact admitted business when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent company's available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state. The NAIC Post-Assessment Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act, a version of which has been adopted by all states, limits assessments to 2 of an insurer s subject premiums and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business. 
 Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability shared market, pooling or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or FAIR plans. In addition, some states require insurers to 
 19 

participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific mechanism in the applicable state. 
 Dividends . We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Trade Practices . State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. 
 Investment Regulation. Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. Investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries' calculation of their statutory capital and surplus. 
 Terrorism Risk Insurance. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 TRIPRA ), the program was extended until December 31, 2027. 
 TRIPRA provides a federal backstop to all U.S. based property and casualty insurers for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on U.S. soil or against certain U.S. air carriers, vessels or foreign missions. TRIPRA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners' multi-peril insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the United States are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. TRIPRA's definition of certified acts includes domestic terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIPRA when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of terrorism. 
 Under the program, the federal government will pay 80 of an insurer's covered losses in excess of the insurer's applicable deductible. The insurer's deductible is calculated as 20 of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2022 earned premiums, our aggregate deductible under TRIPRA during 2023 will be approximately 1,310 million. The federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed 200 million industry-wide for any calendar year after 2020. TRIPRA limits the federal government's share of losses at 100 billion for a program year. In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the 100 billion cap. 
 Excess and Surplus Lines . The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, principally with respect to rates and policy forms, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future. 
 Climate Change and Financial Risks . The NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to the topic of climate risk. The NAIC s goal is to address climate-related risks through three areas of insurance regulation: financial risk analysis; insurance market availability and affordability; and consumer education and outreach. In New York, the NYDFS issued a circular letter in September 2020 that applies to both New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The circular letter states that the NYDFS expects these insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, business strategies and scenario analysis, and develop their approach to climate-related financial disclosure. For example, an insurer should designate a board member or board committee, as well as a senior management function, to oversee the management of financial risks associated with climate change. The NYDFS also adopted an amendment to the regulation governing enterprise risk management, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, that requires an insurance group's enterprise risk management function to address certain additional risks, including climate change risk. 
 
 20 

In addition, the Federal Insurance Office (the FIO is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ), as discussed below under Federal Regulation. The FIO is assessing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climate-related risks and achieve national climate-related goals. 
 
 Diversity and Corporate Governance .The NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to diversity within the insurance industry, such as the diversity of an insurer s board of directors and management. The NAIC is also examining practices in the insurance industry in order to determine how barriers are created that disadvantage or discriminate against people of color or historically underrepresented groups. On March 16, 2021, the NYDFS issued a circular letter stating that it expects the insurers it regulates, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance. See Human Capital Resources below. 
 Federal Regulation. The federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, although federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. The Dodd-Frank Act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States, and created two new federal government bodies, the FIO and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC ). The FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, although it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, as discussed below. The FIO also has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act addresses the roles played by federal regulators at international insurance standard-setting forums, and it directs the Director of the FIO and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to support increased transparency at international standard-setting regulatory forums (e.g., the IAIS). These federal regulations also instruct the FIO and the Federal Reserve to achieve consensus positions with the states through the NAIC prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory forum. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance. The U.S. and the European Union ("EU") signed such a covered agreement (the "EU Covered Agreement") in September 2017. The EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. Under the EU Covered Agreement, reinsurance collateral requirements no longer apply to qualifying EU reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the U.S. market, and U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU market are no longer subject to local presence requirements. The EU Covered Agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the EU Covered Agreement states that, provided the U.S. has adopted group supervision including worldwide group governance, solvency, capital and reporting, U.S.-headquartered insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators, thereby precluding EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of those insurers. 
 In December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a covered agreement with the U.K. (the U.K. Covered Agreement, and together with the EU Covered Agreement, the Covered Agreements in anticipation of the U.K. s exit from the EU. The U.K. Covered Agreement largely reflects the provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and incorporates the same timeframes within it. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with the Covered Agreements as of September 1, 2022, such as state credit for reinsurance laws that result in non-U.S. reinsurers subject to the Covered Agreements being treated less favorably than U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC previously adopted amendments to its Credit for Reinsurance Model Law to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the Covered Agreements, which amendments have been enacted by all states. On September 30, 2022, the FIO reported that it did not recommend taking any preemption action as a result of inconsistency between the Covered Agreements and state credit for reinsurance laws, although it is still monitoring state measures implementing the NAIC s revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law. The FIO plans to publish an update to its preemption report during 2023. The amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law also extends the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the Covered Agreements to qualified reinsurers domiciled in U.S. jurisdictions that are accredited by the NAIC and to non-U.S. jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the U.S. but which the NAIC has identified as reciprocal jurisdictions pursuant to the NAIC Qualified Jurisdiction Process. 
 We cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted, and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 The FIO also can recommend that the FSOC designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States financial stability in the event of the insurer s material financial distress or failure, i.e., a systemically important financial institution or a non-bank SIFI. An insurer so designated by the FSOC will be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and 
 21 

heightened prudential standards. There are currently no such non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC. The FSOC changed its process for designating non-bank SIFIs, effective in January 2020, by adopting an activities-based approach and moving away from the entities-based approach. 
 Based upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution. Although the potential impact of any future amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act on the U.S. insurance industry is not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important non-bank financial companies. 
 International Regulation 
 Our insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA and/or the Financial Conduct Authority FCA ). The PRA s primary objectives with regard to insurers are to promote the safety and soundness of insurers and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for current and future policyholders. The FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the United Kingdom s financial system, and (iii) to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the financial services markets. The PRA and FCA employ a variety of regulatory tools to achieve their objectives, including periodic auditing and reporting requirements, risk assessment reviews, minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements, dividend restrictions, in certain cases, approval requirements governing the appointment of key officers, approval requirements governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements. 
 Our Lloyd s managing agency is also regulated by Lloyd s, and the Lloyd s syndicate business is subject to Lloyd s supervision. Through Lloyd s, we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd s international licenses. In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country. Our insurance subsidiary based in Liechtenstein is regulated by the Financial Market Authority of Liechtenstein ("FMA"), which has regulatory tools analogous to those of the U.K. regulators noted above. 
 Additionally, U.K. and Liechtenstein laws and regulations also impact us as controllers of our European-regulated subsidiaries, whereby we are required to notify the appropriate authorities about significant events relating to such regulated subsidiaries controllers (i.e. persons or entities which have certain levels of direct or indirect voting power or economic interests in the regulated entities) as well as changes of control, and to submit annual reports regarding their controllers. The PRA/FCA s Senior Managers and Certification Regime and analogous regulation in Liechtenstein further provide regulatory frameworks for standards of fitness and propriety, conduct and accountability for individuals in positions of responsibility at insurers. In addition, certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd s. 
 Our insurance business throughout the EU and EEA is subject to Solvency II, an insurance regulatory regime governing, among other things, capital adequacy and risk management. Following the U.K. s withdrawal from the EU, or Brexit, our Lloyd s managing agency (and the U.K. branch of our Liechtenstein subsidiary) are now subject to a separate U.K. prudential regime, which is broadly identical to Solvency II from January 1, 2021. However, the two regimes are likely to diverge in the near future. The U.K. has undertaken a review of Solvency II and of the regulatory regime applicable to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers. 
 Following this review, on November 17, 2022, the U.K. s HM Treasury published a finalized package of proposed reforms to the U.K. s prudential regime, which covers a range of areas including the risk margin, matching adjustment requirements and regulatory reporting obligations. These reforms will be reflected in new U.K. legislation and regulation. 
 Similarly, the European Commission has undertaken its own review of Solvency II and, on September 22, 2021, published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework. The European Council published its agreed position on the European Commission s proposed reforms in June 2022, which it is currently negotiating with the European Parliament, although the full extent of the changes will only be known once the package of legislative reforms is finalized. 
 Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed equivalent to Solvency II. Currently, the U.S. system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed equivalent to Solvency II by European Union authorities. The PRA will also perform separate, but comparable, supervision of group solvency under the U.K. s own domestic prudential regime where a U.S. holding company is a parent of a subsidiary U.K. insurer or reinsurer. 
 The Liechtenstein financial services regulator, the FMA, is the group supervisor for our European-regulated subsidiaries. However, the Covered Agreements prohibit any EU supervisor or the PRA (as applicable) from exercising group-wide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor. 
 We must also comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/879) GDPR ), which took effect 
 22 

in May 2018. The regulation s goal is to impose increased individual rights and protections for all personal data located in or originating from the EU. The Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation, which is the retained EU law version of the GDPR by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (together, U.K. GDPR ), regulate data protection for all individuals within the U.K. Both the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are extraterritorial in that they apply to all businesses in the EU and the U.K. respectively and any business outside the EU and the U.K. that process EU and/or U.K. personal data of individuals in the EU and/or the U.K. Moreover, there are significant fines associated with non-compliance. In particular, we need to monitor our compliance with all relevant member states laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR are introduced. The introduction of the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR, and any resultant changes in EU member states or U.K. national laws and regulations, has increased our compliance obligations and has necessitated the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data, and has required us to change our business practices regarding these matters. 
 In addition, we may become subject to or affected by regulatory policies adopted by the IAIS, an international standard setter consisting of supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions. The IAIS has been working on several initiatives to consider changes to insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system in response to the increasing globalization of the insurance sector. In November 2019, the IAIS formally adopted a global framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups IAIGs ), which is referred to as the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or ComFrame. ComFrame is intended to provide a framework of basic standards for IAIGs and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. Also in November 2019, the IAIS adopted a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard ICS that will apply to IAIGs and ultimately form a part of ComFrame. The ICS commenced a five-year monitoring period in January 2020 which is being used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the IAIS on the ICS s design and performance, but will not trigger any supervisory action. Following this monitoring period, the ICS is expected to be implemented in 2025 as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs and integrated into the rest of ComFrame. As noted above under U.S. Regulation, it is unclear how the development of the ICS will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the United States and the NAIC s development of the group capital calculation. 
 Our international operations are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in Mexico, Australia and Canada and in certain other countries in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia. Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations. 
 Competition 
 The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies. Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer. Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our businesses can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions. Our businesses establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit. 
 Competition for insurance business within the United States comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Our specialty businesses compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers. Our regional businesses compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers. Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional businesses by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company. We compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies. 
 Competition for reinsurance business, which is especially strong, comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Partner Re and others. 
 In recent years, various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, provide increasing competition, which may 
 23 

adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of January 15, 2023, we employed 8,186 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 8,049 individuals and the remaining individuals were employed at the parent company. 
 We believe that our people are our greatest asset and that our corporate culture is the most important intangible driver of long-term value creation for our Company and the highest priority for pursuing long-term risk-adjusted returns and growth in stockholder value. 
 Human Capital Management: The Company fosters a performance culture. We are focused on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our employees to build meaningful and productive careers. The success of these human capital management objectives is essential to our strategy, as it is our people who drive our success. We invest in their growth as individuals and professionals through training and engagement, as well as in their well-being through robust health and wellness programs and a commitment to diversity. 
 The Company provides developmental opportunities for our employees through formal and informal programs that focus on enabling employees to build skills and thought leadership in specific facets of our business. Our leadership programs cultivate the talent of our high-potential, strong-performing employees as we strive to deepen, enhance and diversify the Company s leadership team. 
 We strive to align employee incentives with the risk and performance frameworks of the Company. The Company s pay for performance philosophy connects individual, business and Company results to employee compensation, providing employees with opportunities to share in the Company s overall growth and success. The Company offers employees a comprehensive benefits package, including health and wellness, financial, educational and life management benefits. In addition, we support employees in making an impact in their local communities and globally through environmental and social efforts that are meaningful to them. 
 Our Board of Directors engages with our senior leadership team, including our senior vice president - human resources, on a periodic basis across a range of human capital management issues, including succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, talent recruiting and retention, engagement, diversity and inclusion, and employee feedback. 
 Culture: The Board of Directors has recognized Accountability, People Oriented Strategy, Responsible Financial Practices, Risk-Adjusted Returns and Transparency as the elements of corporate culture necessary for the Company to achieve success. Our culture unifies our employees across our decentralized business model, positions us to serve our diverse clients globally and propels the Company s continuous evolution. 
 We are committed to fostering a unifying culture and encouraging innovation across our enterprise. Our culture encompasses the beliefs that (i) specialized knowledge and having a customer-centric focus are competitive advantages and (ii) an environment that promotes integrity, embraces the commitment to always do right, fosters entrepreneurship and innovation, and values making thoughtful decisions for the long-term benefit of our enterprise. While there is no one Berkley way, each of our businesses has its own culture that embodies a shared set of values that define our enterprise. Our structure, with more than 55 distinct businesses, facilitates the prompt identification of and appropriate action with respect to addressing individual business or cultural issues arising within a business, without affecting the larger enterprise. Furthermore, our businesses are overseen by senior corporate business managers and senior corporate functional managers, including actuarial, claims, underwriting, compliance and finance, providing a governance oversight structure that makes it easier to identify such issues. Because our Board of Directors diligently exercises its risk management oversight through, among other activities, regular interactions with employees beyond corporate senior management, our directors have visibility into and receive timely feedback on cultural issues that may affect our business. 
 As significant owners of our Company who are required to hold their shares until separation from service, each of our directors and senior executives have a vested interest in cultivating talent and perpetuating a culture that facilitates the execution of our long-term objectives. 
 Other Information about the Company's Business 
 We maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, our businesses develop new coverages or enter lines of business to meet the needs of insureds. 
 24 

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance businesses. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, wildfires, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods. 
 We have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues. 
 Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Our businesses face significant risks. If any of the events or circumstances described as risks below occur, our businesses, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition to those described below, our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. 
 Risks Relating to Our Industry 
 Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry. 
 The results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties in demand and pricing, causing cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry. The demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions, while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business. We have faced significant competition in our business as a result of existing insurers seeking to gain or maintain market share as well as new entrants and capital providers. Recently, premium rates have increased for most lines of business, while they have decreased in others, most notably workers' compensation. The adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage, and the effects of economic and social inflation on the amount of claims payments due for injuries or losses. In addition, investment rates of return impact rate adequacy. These factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported. These factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which can pressure premium rates in certain areas and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume in some parts of our business. 
 We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, other regional companies, as well as mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, diversified financial services companies and insurtech companies. Competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors, including premium charges, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, commissions paid to producers, the perceived financial strength of the company, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, ease of doing business, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written. Periods of insurance industry consolidation may further increase competition in some parts of our business and may cause our insurance subsidiaries to incur greater customer retention and acquisition expenses, affecting the profitability of existing and new business. 
 Some of our competitors, particularly in the reinsurance business, have greater financial and/or marketing resources than we do. These competitors within the reinsurance market include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway and Partner Re. We expect that perceived financial strength, in particular, will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers. 
 25 

Recently, insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business, excluding workers' compensation. However, loss costs have also increased and the duration and magnitude of the improving pricing environment remains uncertain. Despite rising interest rates, current price levels for certain lines of business may remain below the prices required for us to achieve our long-term return objectives. We expect to continue to face strong competition in our business. 
 In recent years, various types of investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital or access to third-party capital, provide increasing competition, which may adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of capital may lower costs for insurers and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. In addition, technology companies or other third parties have created, and may in the future create, technology-enabled business models, processes, platforms or alternate distribution channels that may adversely impact our competitive position in some parts of our business. 
 This intense competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves. 
 Our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately 17.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred. 
 Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown. The major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, inflation, judicial theories of liability, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond our control. 
 The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached. In periods with increased economic volatility, it becomes more difficult to accurately estimate claim costs. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Both inflation overall and medical cost inflation, which has historically been greater than inflation overall, can have an adverse impact. In addition, although the Company has estimated the potential COVID-19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation, workers compensation, and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios, there remains uncertainty around COVID-19's ultimate impact on the Company and its related reserves. 
 Reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Should we need to increase our reserves, our pre-tax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount. 
 We discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers' compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities. The expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience. Changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined. If the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated, the discount will be reduced and pre-tax income will decrease by a corresponding amount. 
 The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. 
 As industry practices and economic, legal, judicial, social, technological and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:

judicial expansion of policy coverage and a greater propensity to grant claimants more favorable amounts and the impact of new theories of liability; 
 plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices; 
 social inflation trends, including higher and more frequent claims, more favorable judgments and legislated increases; 
 medical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims; 
 claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies, including cyber security related risks; 
 claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions; and 
 increased claims due to third party funding of litigation. 
 In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued. 
 In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 As a property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and man-made catastrophes. 
 Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results. For example, catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries, including COVID-19 related losses, were 212 million in 2022, 202 million in 2021, and 340 million in 2020. Similarly, man-made catastrophes can also have a material impact on our financial results. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may seek to increase our writing of property casualty insurance, and, accordingly, our exposure to catastrophic events would be increased. 
 Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires, pandemics, as well as terrorist and other man-made activities, including drilling, mining and other industrial accidents, the bankruptcy of a major company, war or other military actions, social unrest, 
 cyber events or terrorist activities. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing due to climate change causing increased variability and unpredictability. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. Catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines, and most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. Seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred. It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has previously materially and adversely affected our results of operations, and, whether as a result of COVID-19's long-term effects, or new or emerging variants, or other potential pandemics, may further materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity in the future. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the related impact on the U.S. and global economies, materially and adversely affected our results of operations. The pandemic and its impact on our business may continue, and potentially even worsen, whether as a result of COVID-19's long-term effects, or new or emerging variants, or even other potential pandemics. We cannot predict the magnitude or duration of such impact, particularly given the uncertainties associated with COVID-19, including regarding the U.S. and global economies and the recovery from its devastating economic and other effects. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity is not yet known, but includes the following : 
 Adverse Legislative and Regulatory Action. Legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to COVID-19 or other similar pandemics may adversely affect us, particularly in our workers compensation and property coverages businesses. For 
 27 

example, our business may be subject to, certain initiatives, including, but not limited to: legislative and regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses that our insurance policies would not otherwise cover and which were not priced to cover; legislative and regulatory action providing for shifting presumptions with respect to the burdens of proof for essential workers on workers compensation coverages and varying definitions of essential workers; actions prohibiting us from cancelling insurance policies in accordance with our policy terms or non-renewing policies at their natural expiration; and/or orders to provide premium refunds, grant extended grace periods for premium payments, and provide extended time to pay past due premiums. Any such action would likely increase both our underwriting losses and our expenses and any legal challenges to any such action could take years to resolve. 
 Claim Losses Related to COVID-19 May Exceed Reserves . As of December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately 341 million for COVID-19-related losses. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown. Accordingly, given the uncertainties still associated with COVID-19 and its impact, our reserves and the underlying estimated level of claim losses and costs arising from COVID-19 may materially change. 
 Claim Losses and Adjustment Expenses May Increase . As the effects of COVID-19 on industry practices and economic, legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions occur, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverages may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent (including in the area of property coverages where physical damage requirements and communicable disease exclusions are currently being challenged) or by increasing the number and/or size of claims, each of which could adversely impact our results. 
 Reinsurance . We purchase reinsurance in order to transfer part of the risk that we have assumed by writing insurance policies to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with assuming such risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. There may be uncertainty surrounding the availability of reinsurance coverage for COVID-19-related losses as our reinsurers may dispute the applicability of reinsurance to such losses (including the application of reinsurance reinstatements) and, as a result, our reinsurers may refuse to pay reinsurance recoverables related thereto or they may not pay them on a timely basis. In addition, we may be unable to renew our current reinsurance coverages or obtain appropriate new reinsurance covers with respect to certain exposures under our policies, including COVID-19-related exposures, and therefore our net exposures could increase, or if we are unwilling to bear such increase in net exposure, we may reduce our level of underwriting commitments. 
 Premium Volumes May Be Negatively Impacted . The demand for insurance is significantly influenced by general economic conditions. Consequently, any reduced economic activity relating to COVID-19 or other potential pandemics is likely to decrease demand for our insurance products and services and negatively impact our premium volumes (and, in certain cases, may result in return of premiums due to a decrease in exposures). This may continue for an indefinite period, with the magnitude of the impact impossible to predict. In addition, as we continue to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the insurance coverages we currently offer, our appetite for providing certain coverages in various jurisdictions may change, which could further negatively impact our premium volumes. Any such reduction in our premiums would likely cause our expense ratio to rise . 
 Investments . Further disruptions in global financial markets due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 or future pandemics could cause us to incur additional unrealized and/or realized investment losses, including impairments in our fixed maturity portfolio and other investments. In addition, the economic uncertainty may result in a decline in interest rates, which may negatively impact our net investment income from future investment activity. 
 Operational Disruptions and Costs . Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our agents, brokers, suppliers or other third party service providers are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, our agents, brokers, suppliers and other third party service providers, which we rely on for key aspects of our operations, are subject to similar risks and uncertainties, which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Any remote working policies we implement may result in disruptions to our business routines, heightened risk to cybersecurity attacks and data security incidents and a greater dependency on internet and telecommunication access and capabilities. 
 Changing climate conditions may alter the frequency and increase the severity of catastrophic events and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results. 
 Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, appear to have contributed to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future 
 28 

trends and exposures. There is a growing scientific consensus that global warming and other climate change are altering the frequency, severity and peril characteristics of catastrophic weather events, such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods and other natural disasters. Such changes make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events, reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks. Any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters may adversely affect our financial condition and results. 
 We, as a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist acts. 
 To the extent an act of terrorism, whether a domestic or foreign act, is certified by the Secretary of Treasury, we may be covered under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 TRIPRA ), for up to 80 of our covered losses for certain property/casualty lines of insurance. However, any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20 of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2022 earned premiums, our aggregate deductible under TRIPRA during 2023 is approximately 1,310 million. In addition, the coverage provided under TRIPRA does not apply to reinsurance that we write. To the extent that our reinsurers have excluded coverage for certain terrorist acts or have priced this coverage at rates that make purchasing such coverage economically infeasible, we may not have reinsurance protection and could be exposed to potential losses as a result of any acts of terrorism. 
 We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims. 
 We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances. We face potential exposure to mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, such as lead paint, polyfluoroalkyl substances, talc and opioids. Establishing loss reserves for mass tort claims is subject to uncertainties because of many factors, including adverse changes to the tort environment (e.g., increased and more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims, increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards, lawsuit abuse and third-party litigation finance, among others); evolving judicial interpretations, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities; disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases; geographical concentration of the lawsuits asserting the claims; and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current loss reserves. In addition, our estimate of loss reserves may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, could vary significantly from period to period and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position. 
 We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business. 
 We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. This system of regulation, generally administered in the United States by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, relates to, among other things: 
 standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements; 
 restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments; 
 limitations on the amount of dividends, tax distributions, intercompany loans and other payments that can be made without prior regulatory approval; 
 
 requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting; 
 
 evaluating enterprise risk to an insurer; 
 rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses; 
 potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies; and 
 involvement in the payment or adjudication of catastrophe or other claims beyond the terms of the policies. 
 State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters. Our Insurance business internationally is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations outside the United States. 
 29 

Federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to conditions in the financial markets, global insurance supervision and other factors may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC ), which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant non-bank financial companies, including insurance companies, be regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office FIO which is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the U.S. insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the U.S. insurance market. The FIO also can recommend that the FSOC designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States financial stability in the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure. Our business could be affected by changes, whether as a result of potential changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non-bank financial companies. 
 The topic of climate risk has come under increased scrutiny by the NAIC and insurance regulators. For instance, in New York, the NYDFS issued a circular letter in September 2020 that applies to both New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, such as our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York. The circular letter states that the NYDFS expects these insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, business strategies and scenario analysis, and develop their approach to climate-related financial disclosure. The NYDFS also amended the regulation governing enterprise risk management, which applies to our insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, that requires an insurance group's enterprise risk management function to address certain additional risks, including climate change risk. In addition, the FIO is assessing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climate-related risks and achieve national climate-related goals. These measures may subject us to increased oversight at the state and federal level. 
 State regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance in the United States, although Congress has considered various proposals regarding federal regulation of insurance, in addition to the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act, such as proposals for the creation of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. We may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution. In addition, the current U.S. administration and the volatile political environment may increase the chance of other federal legislative and regulatory changes that could affect us in ways we cannot predict. 
 With respect to international measures, Solvency II, the EU regime concerning the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers may affect our insurance businesses. Implementation of Solvency II in EU member states occurred on January 1, 2016, and as the Solvency II regime evolves over time, we may be required to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance. In particular, the European Commission has undertaken a review of Solvency II and on September 22, 2021, published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework. The European Council published its agreed position on the European Commission s proposed reforms in June 2022, and it is now discussing this proposed legislation with the European Parliament. In addition, despite the waiver of the Solvency II group capital requirements we received, Solvency II may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our EU domiciled insurers. Additionally, our capital requirements and compliance requirements may be adversely affected if the European Commission does not deem the insurance regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions outside the EU in which we have insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled to be equivalent to Solvency II. 
 Similar considerations apply to our U.K. subsidiaries, which are now subject to a separate U.K. prudential regime, which is broadly identical to Solvency II. However, the two regimes, and their respective requirements, are likely to diverge in the near future due to both the EU s review of Solvency II described above and HM Treasury s publication of a finalized package of reforms to the U.K. s domestic prudential regime on November 17, 2022 (please see International Regulation above for more information). We therefore may be required to utilize additional resources to ensure compliance with the different rules in each regime. 
 If our compliance with Solvency II, the U.K. s prudential regime or any other regulatory regime is challenged, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties. In addition, in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or as a result of any investigation, including remediation efforts, we could be required to incur significant expenses and undertake additional work, which in turn may divert resources from our business. 
 We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities 
 30 

could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations thereof by regulatory authorities, may further restrict the conduct of our business. 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 Our expanding international operations expose us to increased investment, political, legal/regulatory, and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. 
 Our expanding international operations in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Canada, Mexico, Scandinavia, the Asia-Pacific region, South Africa and Australia expose us to increased investment, political, legal/regulatory, and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our investments in non-U.S.-denominated assets are subject to fluctuations in non-U.S. securities and currency markets, and those markets can be volatile. Non-U.S. currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non-U.S. subsidiaries to their parent companies in the U.S. 
 We face additional risks as a result of our international operations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including: burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and the associated risk and costs of non-compliance; exposure to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, which may result in unpredictable or inconsistent application of laws and regulations; exposure to commercial, political, legal or regulatory corruption; political, economic or other instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; the imposition of tariffs, trade barriers or other protectionist laws or business practices that favor local competition, increased costs and adverse effects on our business; changes to visa or immigration policies; diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights; potential increased risk of data breaches; differences in cultural environments; sociopolitical instability; social, political or economic instability resulting from climate change; changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services; exposure to local economic conditions and its impact on our clients performance and creditworthiness; and restrictions on the repatriation of non-U.S. investments and earnings. 
 Our U.K. business could be specifically adversely impacted by the imposition of trade barriers between the EU and the U.K. following Brexit, which has already reduced the level of trade between the two markets and the U.K. s overall trade exports, thereby negatively affecting the attractiveness of the U.K. market. 
 We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees. 
 We depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our President and CEO, Executive Chairman, senior executive officers, presidents of our businesses, experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, and be unable to expand our operations into new products and markets. 
 We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience losses. 
 We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed, known as ceding, to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our liability to our policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. This failure to pay or failure to pay on a timely basis may be due to factors such as whether reinsurers, their affiliates or certain indemnitors have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail to pay us, our financial results would be adversely affected. Underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims. As of December 31, 2022, the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately 3,188 million, including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk. Certain of these amounts are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf. 
 We are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders, independent agents and brokers. 
 In addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio, we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers. For example our policyholders, independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us 
 31 

or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds. 
 As credit risk is generally a function of the economy, we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn. While we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. For example, to reduce such credit risk, we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us. In cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy. In cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit. 
 We are rated by A.M. Best, Standard Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease. 
 Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Standard Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Our ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings, especially given that rating agencies may change their criteria or increase capital requirements for various rating levels. For instance, Standard Poor's has recently proposed changes to its rating model which could impact our rating depending on final changes that are implemented. 
 If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Standard Poor's, Moody's or Fitch, our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A ratings downgrade could also adversely limit our access to capital markets, which may increase the cost of debt. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings. 
 If market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. 
 As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits. We also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase, which may affect the level of our business and profitability. Our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal, and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. In addition, we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing. If we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks. 
 Depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy, we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed. 
 If conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable, which may result from disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries and/or to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business, such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures, and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so, on terms acceptable to us. 
 We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures. 
 
 As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis, and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or start-up ventures will be successful. Our financial results could be adversely affected by acquired businesses not performing as projected, unforeseen liabilities, routine and unanticipated transaction-related charges, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies, loss of key employees, challenges in integrating information technology systems of acquired companies with our own, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges 
 32 

for impairment of long-term assets or goodwill and indemnification. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we experience difficulties with our information technology, telecommunications or other computer systems, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively or severely impacted. 
 Our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees' ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address such a business interruption, system failure or service denial, our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed. 
 Failure to maintain the security of information technology systems and confidential data may expose us to liability . 
 Although we have taken steps intended to protect our data and information technology systems and mitigate the risk of harm caused by cybersecurity incidents or breaches, no safeguards are perfect and any failure of these safeguards could cause a substantial disruption of our business operations, which could result in service interruptions, data security compromises, regulatory action, and other similar operational and legal issues, as well as substantial remediation and other costs. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Cybersecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, attacks by hackers, ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, supply chain attacks, breaches due to employee error or misconduct and other similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained in our information technology systems and in the information technology systems of our vendors and other third parties. We have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches of our information technology systems as well as the information technology systems of our vendors and other third parties, but, to our knowledge, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity breaches. We expect cybersecurity breaches to continue to occur in the future and we are constantly managing efforts to infiltrate and compromise our systems and data. Our electronic transmission of personal, confidential and proprietary information to third parties with whom we have business relationships and our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security. While we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these third-party vendors and others with whom we do business, our vendors and third parties could still suffer data breaches that could result in the exposure of sensitive data and the infiltration of our computer systems. Our failure to effectively protect sensitive personal and/or proprietary information, whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors and other third parties, could result in significant monetary and reputational damages, material adverse effects to our financial condition, costly litigation, or other regulatory enforcement actions. These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, including required compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and additional state-specific privacy statutes and regulations, could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs. As a result, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective. 
 Our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards, including those related to privacy, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and global finance and insurance matters. Our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation. 
 We could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. Federal income tax laws. 
 Tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, fundamentally overhauled the U.S. tax system by, among other significant changes, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 . In the context of the taxation of U.S. property/casualty insurance companies such as the Company, the Act also modified the loss reserve discounting rules and the proration rules that apply to reduce reserve deductions to reflect the lower 
 33 

corporate income tax rate. It is possible that other legislation could be introduced and enacted by the current Congress or future Congresses that could have an adverse impact on us. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying provisions of the Act may be forthcoming. We cannot predict if, when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided, whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect or their potential impact on us. 
 Limitations in risk management and loss limitation methods may adversely impact our business. 
 We seek to effectively manage risk and limit our losses in a variety of ways including through effective underwriting, tailoring policy terms, and the use of reinsurance. However, there are certain limitations in these and similar tactics and as a result, loss levels may be higher than modeled or otherwise expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Increased scrutiny on social responsibility and the efforts we take to implement related measures, or the failure to take such measures, may adversely impact our business. 
 There is increased scrutiny from regulators and investors on the measures companies take to be socially responsible. Although we have made efforts to be responsible in this manner, for example through our commitment to fostering a unifying culture and encouraging innovation across our operating units, these types of pressures may nonetheless present challenges and have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we may be subject to negative publicity based on a failure or perceived failure to achieve various social responsibility initiatives and goals relating to diversity, equity and inclusion, and commitment to long-term sustainability we may announce from time to time, or based on an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry s business activities. 
 Risks Relating to Our Investments 
 A significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations. 
 Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities. As of December 31, 2022, our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately 17.6 billion, or 72.4 of our total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. As of that date, our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities: U.S. Government securities (5.1 ); state and municipal securities (16.8 ); corporate securities (38.1 ); asset-backed securities (22.6 ); mortgage-backed securities (9.4 and foreign government (8.0 ). 
 The fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise. If a significant increase in interest rates were to occur, the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would be negatively impacted, while investment income earned from future investments in fixed-maturity securities would be higher. Conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities would be positively impacted and investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower. Some fixed maturity securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations. In low interest rate environments, we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals. 
 The value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer, default by the issuer (including states and municipalities) in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities and/or increases in market interest rates. To a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession. During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, particularly if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the then current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment. 
 Although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low, our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. Many states and municipalities operate under deficits or projected deficits, the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuer's ability to perform its obligations thereunder. Additionally, our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest, as well as risks inherent in particular securities. 
 Although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal, our efforts may not be successful. Impairments, defaults and/or rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment

losses. Investment returns are currently, and will likely continue to remain, under pressure due to economic uncertainty, more generally, and the shape of the yield curve. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 
 We have invested a portion of our assets in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets, which are subject to significant volatility and may decline in value. 
 We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. At December 31, 2022, our investment in these assets was approximately 5.3 billion, or 21.6 , of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. 
 Merger and arbitrage trading securities were 0.9 billion, or 3.9 of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022. Merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period, usually four months or less. Our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals, which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks. 
 Real estate related investments, including directly owned, investment funds and loans receivable, were 1.7 billion, or 7.1 of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2022. We also invest in real estate, financial services, energy, transportation and other investment funds. The values of these investments are subject to fluctuation based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and the related asset valuations in particular. In addition, our investments in real estate related assets and other alternative investments are less liquid than our other investments. 
 These investments are subject to significant volatility as a result of the conditions in the financial and commodity markets and the global economy. 
 Risks Relating to Limitations on Dividends from Subsidiaries and Anti-Takeover Provisions 
 We are an insurance holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts. 
 As an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses. The payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and competitive pressures on maintaining financial strength ratings and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries. During 2023, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately 1.2 billion. Future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay us dividends. As a result, in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations, pay dividends or repurchase shares. 
 Laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay, deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable, and may restrict a stockholder's ability to purchase our common stock. 
 Generally, United States insurance holding company laws require that, before a person can acquire control of an insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authority in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, control over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of that insurer or any parent company of such insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock. Thus, the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock. Some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the target insurer and its affiliates, on the other hand, have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state. Additionally, many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements. 
 These provisions can also lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. 
 35 

Certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management. 
 Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, as well as state insurance statutes, may hinder, delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors. 
 These provisions include: 
 our classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships; 
 the requirement that the holders of 80 of our shares must approve mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5 or more of our shares, unless the transaction was approved by our board of directors prior to such holder's acquisition of 5 of our shares; and 
 the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders' meetings. 
 These provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
 W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property and casualty business: Insurance and Reinsurance Monoline Excess. Our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics. While providing our business units with certain operating autonomy, our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital, investment, reinsurance, enterprise risk management, and actuarial, financial and corporate legal staff support. The Company s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments. 
 An important part of our strategy is to form new businesses to capitalize on various opportunities. Over the years, the Company has formed numerous businesses that are focused on important parts of the economy in the U.S., including healthcare, cyber security, energy and agriculture, and on growing international markets, including the Asia-Pacific region, South America and Mexico. 
 The profitability of the Company s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time an insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural and other disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic or social inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses. General insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity, i.e., the level of capital employed in the industry, and the industry s willingness to deploy that capital. 
 The Company s profitability is also affected by its investment income and investment gains. The Company s invested assets are invested principally in fixed maturity securities. The return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates, as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities. 
 The Company also invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. The Company's investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced, and the Company expects to continue to experience, greater fluctuations in investment income. The Company's share of the earnings or losses from investment funds is generally reported on a one-quarter lag in order to facilitate the timely completion of the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 On February 25, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 common stock split which was paid in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record as of March 9, 2022. The additional shares were issued on March 23, 2022. Shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Form 10-K reflect such 3-for-2 common stock split. 
 On March 7, 2022, the Company sold a real estate investment consisting of an office building located in London for 718 million. The Company realized a pretax gain of 317 million in the first quarter of 2022, before transaction expenses and the impact of foreign currency, including the reversal of the currency translation adjustment. The gain was 251 million after such adjustments. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, including the related impact on the U.S. and global economies, continued to adversely affect our results of operations. At the same time, COVID-19 has led to reduced loss frequency in certain lines of business (which partially returned to pre-pandemic levels as many economies and legal systems have reopened). The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity is not within the Company s control and remains unclear due to, among other factors, its ongoing impact and uncertainty in connection with its claims, reserves and reinsurance recoverables.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses, assumed reinsurance premiums and other-than-temporary impairments of investments. Management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 
 Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses . To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer s payment of that loss. 
 In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported IBNR to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided. 
 In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among other things, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are based on management s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed. 
 Reserves do not represent a certain calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time, the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to uncertainty. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties which are beyond the Company s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. 
 Loss reserves included in the Company s financial statements represent management s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations. The Company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each business. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development, paid and incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and frequency and severity methods. In circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others, that method is used to set the point estimate. For example, the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data. For new lines of business, where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data, or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices, the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods. The actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered. Industry loss experience is used to supplement the Company s own data in selecting tail factors and in areas where the Company s own data is limited. The actuarial data is analyzed by line of business, coverage and accident or policy year, as appropriate, for each business. 
 The establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses. These qualitative considerations include, among others, the impact of re-underwriting initiatives, changes in the mix of business, changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions. Examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits, the expansion of coverage exclusions, whether or not defense costs are within policy limits, and changes in deductibles and attachment points. 
 40 

The key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation, and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios represent management s expectation of losses at the time the business is priced and written, before any actual claims experience has emerged. This expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes, loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten. Expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each business. Expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the long-tail lines, such as excess casualty, and claims with a high medical component, such as workers compensation. Reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value. Loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses, and are derived from the Company s own experience and industry data. The paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns. Management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred; however, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. 
 Loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves, including expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. 
 Another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag, which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the Company. The length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency (loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags) as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses (less IBNR is required for lines with short reporting lags). As a result, loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates. For lines with short reporting lags, which include commercial automobile, primary workers compensation, other liability (claims-made) and property business, the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date. For lines of business with long reporting lags, which include other liability (occurrence), products liability, excess workers compensation and liability reinsurance, the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Historically, the Company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags. 
 The key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted, to the extent necessary, to reflect the latest reported loss data, current trends and other factors observed. If the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate losses will be different than management s estimate. The following table reflects the impact of changes (which could be favorable or unfavorable) in frequency and severity, relative to our assumptions, on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2022: 
 (In thousands) Frequency (+/-) Severity (+/-) 1 5 10 1 116,072 349,370 640,993 5 349,370 591,908 895,081 10 640,993 895,081 1,212,690 
 Our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 relate to multiple accident years. Therefore, the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above. The impact of such changes would likely be manifested gradually over the course of many years, as the magnitude of the changes became evident. 
 Approximately 3.0 billion, or 21 , of the Company s net loss reserves as of December 31, 2022 relate to the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment. There is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of excess workers' compensation and assumed reinsurance loss reserves. In the case of excess workers compensation, our policies generally attach at 1 million or higher. The claims which reach our layer therefore tend to involve the most serious injuries and many remain open for the lifetime of the claimant, which extends the claim settlement tail. These claims also occur less frequently but tend to be larger than primary claims, which increases claim variability. In the case of assumed reinsurance our loss reserve estimates are based, in part, upon information received from ceding companies. If information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct, the Company s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate. Furthermore, due to 
 41 

delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies, the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is also extended. Management considers the impact of delayed reporting and the extended tail in its selection of loss development factors for these lines of business. 
 Information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios, to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business. This information, which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries, is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies. The Company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the Company. The information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the Company s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks. 
 Following is a summary of the Company s reserves for losses and loss expenses by business segment as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

The Company evaluates reserves for losses and loss expenses on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates of prior year losses are reported when such changes are made. The changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends. 
 Certain of the Company's insurance and reinsurance contracts are retrospectively rated, whereby the Company collects more or less premiums based on the level of loss activity. For those contracts, changes in loss and loss expenses for prior years may be fully or partially offset by additional or return premiums. 
 Net prior year development (i.e, the sum of prior year reserve changes and prior year earned premiums changes) for each of the last three years ended December 31, are as follows: 
 (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Increase in prior year loss reserves (54,511) (863) (627) Increase in prior year earned premiums 18,106 7,510 16,807 Net (unfavorable) favorable prior year development (36,405) 6,647 16,180 
 The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted, and may further impact, the Company s results through its effect on claim frequency and severity. Loss cost trends have been impacted and may be further impacted by COVID-19-related claims in certain lines of business. Losses incurred from COVID-19-related claims have been offset, to a certain extent, by lower claim frequency in certain lines of our businesses; however, as the economy and legal systems have reopened, the benefit of lower claim frequency has partially abated. The ultimate net impact of COVID-19 on the Company remains uncertain. New variants of the COVID-19 virus continue to create risks with respect to loss costs and the potential for renewed impact of the other effects of COVID-19 associated with economic conditions, inflation, and social distancing and work from home rules. 
 Most of the COVID-19-related claims reported to the Company to date involve certain short-tailed lines of business, including contingency and event cancellation, business interruption, and film production delay. The Company has also received COVID-19-related claims for longer-tailed casualty lines of business such as workers compensation and other liability; however, the estimated incurred loss impact for these reported claims are not material at this time. Given the continuing uncertainty regarding the pandemic's pervasiveness, the future impact that the pandemic may have on claim frequency and severity remains uncertain at this time. 
 The Company has estimated the potential COVID-19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation, workers compensation, and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios; however, due to COVID-19 s continued evolving impact, there remains uncertainty around the Company s COVID-19 reserves. In addition, should the pandemic continue or worsen as a result of new COVID-19 variants or otherwise, governments in the jurisdictions where we operate may impose restrictions, including lockdowns, as well as renew their efforts to expand policy coverage terms beyond the policy s intended coverage. Accordingly, losses arising from these actions, and the other factors described above, could exceed the Company s reserves established for those related policies. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recognized losses for COVID-19-related claims activity, net of reinsurance, of approximately 341 million, of which 290 million relates to the Insurance segment and 51 million relates to the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment. Such 341 million of COVID-19-related losses included 337 million of reported losses and 4 million of IBNR. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized current accident year losses for COVID-19-related claims activity, net of reinsurance, of approximately 5 million, of which 3 million relates to the Insurance segment and 2 million relates to the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment. 
 Unfavorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was 36 million in 2022. 
 Insurance Reserves for the Insurance segment developed unfavorably by 40 million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The unfavorable development in the segment primarily related to COVID-19 losses at two businesses. These businesses wrote policies providing coverage for event cancellation and film production delay which were heavily impacted by losses directly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of this COVID-19 related unfavorable development emerged during the third quarter as a result of settlements of claims at values higher than our expectations. However, the Company believes that as a result of these settlements the remaining level of uncertainty around the ultimate value of its known COVID-19 claims has been significantly reduced. 
 The unfavorable development mentioned above also includes favorable prior year development for the Insurance segment primarily attributable to the 2020 and 2021 accident years and unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years. The favorable development on the 2020 and 2021 accident years was concentrated in certain casualty lines of business including general liability, professional liability, and workers compensation. The Company experienced lower 
 43 

reported claim frequency in these lines of business during 2020 and 2021 relative to historical averages, and continued to experience lower reported incurred losses relative to its expectations for these accident years as they developed during 2022. These trends began in 2020 and we believe were caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including for example, lockdowns, reduced driving/traffic and increased work from home. Due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on accident years 2020 and 2021 incurred losses, the Company has been cautious in reacting to these lower trends in setting and updating its loss ratio estimates for these years. As these accident years have continued to mature, the Company has continued to recognize some of the favorable reported experience in its ultimate loss estimates made during 2022. 
 The unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years was concentrated in the general liability and professional liability, including medical professional, lines of business, as well as commercial auto liability. The development was driven by a larger than expected number of large losses reported. The Company believes social inflation is contributing to an increase in the frequency of large losses for these accident years. Social inflation can include higher settlement demands from plaintiffs, use of tactics such as litigation funding by the plaintiffs bar, negative public sentiment towards large businesses and corporations, and erosion of tort reforms, among others. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Reserves for the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment developed favorably by 4 million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable development for the segment was driven mainly by favorable development in excess workers compensation, substantially offset by unfavorable development in the professional liability and non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability lines of business. The favorable excess workers compensation development was spread across most prior accident years, including 2012 and prior years, and was driven by a review of the Company s claim reporting patterns as well as a number of favorable claim settlements relative to expectations. The unfavorable professional liability and non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability development was concentrated mainly in accident years 2016 through 2018 and was associated primarily with our U.S. assumed reinsurance business and related to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. 
 Favorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was 7 million in 2021. 
 Insurance Reserves for the Insurance segment developed favorably by 20 million in 2021 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable development in 2021 was attributable to favorable development on the 2020 accident year, partially offset by adverse development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years. 
 The favorable development on the 2020 accident year was largely concentrated in the commercial auto liability and other liability lines of business, including commercial multi-peril liability. During 2020 the Company achieved larger rate increases in these lines of business than were contemplated in its budget and in its initial loss ratio selections. The Company also experienced significantly lower reported claim frequency in these lines in 2020 relative to historical averages, and lower reported incurred losses relative to its expectations. We believe that the lower claim frequency and lower reported incurred losses were caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, lockdowns, reduced driving and traffic, work from home, and court closures. However, due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on accident year 2020 incurred losses, the Company elected not to react to these lower reported trends during 2020. As more information became available and the 2020 accident year continued to mature, during 2021 the Company started to recognize favorable accident year 2020 development in response to the continuing favorable reported loss experience relative to its expectations. 
 The adverse development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years is concentrated largely in the other liability line of business, including commercial multi-peril liability, but is also seen to a lesser extent in commercial auto liability. The adverse development for these accident years is driven by a higher than expected number of large losses reported, and particularly impacted the directors and officers liability, lawyers professional liability, and excess and surplus lines casualty classes of business. We also believe that increased social inflation is contributing to the increased number of large losses, for example, higher jury awards on cases which go to trial, and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases which do not go to trial. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Reserves for the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment developed unfavorably by 13 million in 2021. The unfavorable development in the segment was driven by the non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability lines of business, related primarily to accident years 2017 through 2019, and was partially offset by favorable development in excess workers compensation business which was spread across many prior accident years. The unfavorable non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability development was associated with our U.S. and U.K. assumed reinsurance business, and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures.

Favorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was 16 million in 2020. 
 Insurance - Reserves for the Insurance segment developed favorably by 24 million in 2020 (net of additional and return premiums). Continuing the pattern seen in recent years, the overall favorable development in 2020 resulted from more significant favorable development on workers compensation business, which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability, including excess professional liability 
 For workers compensation, the favorable development was spread across almost all prior accident years, including prior to 2011, but was most significant in accident years 2016 through 2019. The favorable workers compensation development reflects a continuation of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years, particularly the favorable claim frequency trends (i.e., number of reported claims per unit of exposure). The long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety. Loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers. Reported workers compensation losses in 2020 continued to be below our expectations at most of our businesses, and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates for most prior accident years. 
 For professional liability business, unfavorable development was driven mainly by large losses reported in the directors and officers D O ), lawyers professional and excess hospital professional liability lines of business. For these lines of business, we continue to see an increase in the number of large losses reported and a lengthening of the reporting tail beyond historical levels. We believe a contributing cause is rising social inflation in the form of, for example, higher jury awards on cases that go to trial, and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial. The unfavorable development for professional liability affected mainly accident years 2016 through 2018. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Reserves for the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment developed unfavorably by 8 million in 2020. The unfavorable development in the segment was driven by non-proportional assumed liability business written in both the U.S. and U.K., and was partially offset by favorable development on excess workers compensation business. The unfavorable non-proportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2014 through 2018, and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. 
 Reserve Discount . The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers compensation reserves. The amount of workers compensation reserves that were discounted was 1,267 million and 1,387 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was 416 million and 452 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, discount rates by year ranged from 0.7 to 6.5 , with a weighted average discount rate of 3.4 . 
 Substantially all discounted workers compensation reserves (97 of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022) are excess workers compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company s loss payout experience. 
 The Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers compensation reserves (representing approximately 3 of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates prescribed or permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. 
 Assumed Reinsurance Premiums . The Company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts. These premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the Company by the ceding companies. As estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised, the related amount of earned premiums, commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded. Estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately 60 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements, information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements, reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries. The Company also considers its own view of market conditions, economic trends and experience with similar lines of business. These premium estimates represent management s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements.

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses on Investments . 
 Fixed Maturity Securities For fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position where the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery in value, the amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through net investment gains (losses). For fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position where the Company does not intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery in value, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or all other factors (non-credit factors). In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded for the credit loss through net investment gains (losses), limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020, the allowance is adjusted for any change in expected credit losses and subsequent recoveries through net investment gains (losses). The impairment related to non-credit factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 The Company s credit assessment of allowance for expected credit losses uses a third party model for available for sale and held to maturity securities, as well as loans receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is generally based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that involve subjective judgments and estimates by management. Modeling these securities involves various factors, such as projected default rates, the nature and realizable value of the collateral, if any, the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments, historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the allowance for expected credit losses, if any. In general, the model reverts to the rating-level long-term average marginal default rates based on 10 years of historical data, beyond the forecast period. For other inputs, the model in most cases reverts to the baseline long-term assumptions linearly over 5 years beyond the forecast period. The long-term assumptions are based on the historical averages. 
 The Company classifies its fixed maturity securities by credit rating, primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. For purposes of classifying securities with different ratings, the Company uses the average of the credit ratings assigned, unless in limited situations the Company s own analysis indicates an internal rating is more appropriate. Securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the Company on a case-by-case basis. 
 A summary of the Company s non-investment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 is presented in the table below. 
 
 in thousands) Number of Securities Aggregate Fair Value Unrealized Loss Foreign government 36 119,332 73,900 Corporate 10 39,347 4,649 State and municipal 1 12,247 2,756 Mortgage-backed securities 14 4,464 269 Asset-backed securities 1 16 10 Total 
 62 175,406 81,584 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded an allowance for expected credit losses on fixed maturity securities of 37 million. The Company has evaluated the remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sector-related factors rather than to issuer-specific factors. None of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants. Based on its assessment of these issuers, the Company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due. 
 Loans Receivable For loans receivable, the Company estimates an allowance for expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the amortized cost of the financial asset. The allowance for expected credit losses is presented as a reduction to amortized cost of the financial asset in the consolidated balance sheet and changes to the estimate for expected credit losses are recognized through net investment gains (losses). Loans receivable are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses of 2 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Fair Value Measurements . The Company s fixed maturity available for sale securities, equity securities, and its trading account securities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
 46 

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date". The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The fair value of the vast majority of the Company s portfolio is based on observable data (other than quoted prices) and, accordingly, is classified as Level 2. 
 In classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy, the Company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable. The Company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The Company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers, the uninterrupted availability of such inputs, the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time. If the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable, the security is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, the Company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. Quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions. For publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable, the Company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data. For securities traded only in private negotiations, the Company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities, which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer, financial data, projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information. 
 The following is a summary of pricing sources for the Company's fixed maturity securities available for sale as of December 31, 2022: 
 (In thousands) Carrying Value Percent of Total Pricing source: Independent pricing services 17,025,723 97.1 Syndicate manager 62,966 0.4 Directly by the Company based on: Observable data 447,364 2.5 Total 17,536,053 100.0 
 Independent pricing services - Substantially all of the Company s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services (generally one U.S. pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the Company). The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities). The determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class. The Company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities. If the prices appear unusual to the Company, they are re-examined and the value is either confirmed or revised. In addition, the Company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services. Based upon the Company s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services, these securities were classified as Level 2. 
 Syndicate manager The Company has a 15 participation in a Lloyd s syndicate, and the Company s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate s manager. The majority of the securities are liquid, short duration fixed maturity securities. The Company reviews the syndicate manager s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices. Based upon the Company s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager, these securities were classified as Level 2. 
 47 

Observable data If independent pricing is not available, the Company prices the securities directly. Prices are based on observable market data where available, including current trading levels for similar securities and non-binding quotations from brokers. The Company generally requests two or more quotes. If more than one quote is received, the Company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security. The Company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers. Since these securities were priced based on observable data, they were classified as Level 2. 
 Cash flow model If the above methodologies are not available, the Company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads, interest rates and interest rate volatility, time to maturity and subordination levels. Discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate. These securities were classified as Level 3.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Business Segment Results 
 Following is a summary of gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned, loss ratios (losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned), expense ratios (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned) and GAAP combined ratios (sum of loss ratio and expense ratio) for each of our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The GAAP combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding investment income. A GAAP combined ratio in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit. 
 (In thousands) 2022 2021 Insurance Gross premiums written 10,583,785 9,471,667 Net premiums written 8,784,146 7,743,814 Net premiums earned 8,369,062 7,077,708 Loss ratio 61.3 61.1 Expense ratio 27.9 28.3 GAAP combined ratio 89.2 89.4 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Gross premiums written 1,325,267 1,228,467 Net premiums written 1,219,924 1,119,053 Net premiums earned 1,192,367 1,028,323 Loss ratio 61.3 61.0 Expense ratio 28.4 29.7 GAAP combined ratio 89.7 90.7 Consolidated Gross premiums written 11,909,052 10,700,134 Net premiums written 10,004,070 8,862,867 Net premiums earned 9,561,429 8,106,031 Loss ratio 61.3 61.1 Expense ratio 28.0 28.5 GAAP combined ratio 89.3 89.6 
 
 Net Income to Common Stockholders . The following table presents the Company s net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Net income to common stockholders 1,381,062 1,022,490 Weighted average diluted shares 279,461 279,749 Net income per diluted share 4.94 3.66 
 The Company reported net income of 1,381 million in 2022 compared to 1,022 million in 2021. The 359 million increase in net income was primarily due to an after-tax increase in underwriting income of 145 million mainly due to the growth in premium rates and exposure as well as reductions in expense ratio driven by net earned premium growth outpacing expense growth, an after-tax increase in net investment gains of 90 million primarily due to the sale of a real estate investment in London as well as change in market value of equity securities, an after-tax increase in net investment income of 87 million primarily due to rising interest rates and a larger investment portfolio related to fixed maturity securities, an after-tax increase in foreign currency gains of 20 million, an after-tax reduction in interest expenses of 14 million due to debt repayment and refinancings, an after-tax reduction on debt extinguishment expense of 9 million for debt redeemed in 2021, an after-tax increase in profit from insurance service businesses of 5 million, an after-tax increase of 5 million in minority interest and a reduction of 2 million in tax expense due to a change in the effective tax rate, partially offset by an after-tax increase in corporate expenses of 17 million mainly due to performance-based compensation costs and an after-tax decrease in profits from non-insurance businesses of 1 million. The number of weighted average diluted shares decreased by 0.3 million for 2022 compared to 2021 mainly reflecting shares repurchased in 2021 and 2022. 
 Premiums . Gross premiums written were 11,909 million in 2022, an increase of 11 from 10,700 million in 2021. The increase was due to the growth in the Insurance segment of 1,112 million and 97 million in the Reinsurance Monoline 
 49 

Excess segment. Approximately 82 of premiums expiring were renewed in both 2022 and 2021. 
 Average renewal premium rates for insurance and facultative reinsurance increased 6.4 in 2022 and 9.1 in 2021, when adjusted for changes in exposures. Average renewal premium rates for insurance and facultative reinsurance excluding workers' compensation increased 7.5 in 2022 and 10.4 in 2021, when adjusted for changes in exposures. 
 A summary of gross premiums written in 2022 compared with 2021 by line of business within each business segment follows: 
 Insurance gross premiums increased 12 to 10,584 million in 2022 from 9,472 million in 2021. Gross premiums increased 539 million (16 for other liability, 354 million (17 for short-tail lines, 143 million (12 for commercial auto, 70 million (6 for workers' compensation and 6 million (0.4 for professional liability. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess gross premiums increased 8 to 1,325 million in 2022 from 1,228 million in 2021. Gross premiums written increased 58 million (8 for casualty lines, 28 million (12 for property lines and 11 million (5 for monoline excess. 
 Net premiums written were 10,004 million in 2022, an increase of 13 from 8,863 million in 2021. Ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums were 16 in 2022 and 17 in 2021. 
 Premiums earned increased 18 to 9,561 million in 2022 from 8,106 million in 2021. Insurance premiums (including the impact of rate changes) are generally earned evenly over the policy term, and accordingly recent rate increases will be earned over the upcoming quarters. Premiums earned in 2022 are related to business written during both 2022 and 2021. Audit premiums were 312 million in 2022 compared with 195 million in 2021. 
 Net Investment Income . Following is a summary of net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Amount Average Annualized Yield (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fixed maturity securities, including cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable 549,281 382,001 2.9 2.2 Investment funds 145,099 220,014 8.9 15.8 Equity securities 52,600 32,020 4.9 5.0 Arbitrage trading account 45,213 37,676 4.0 5.3 Real estate (3,087) 7,703 (0.2) 0.4 Gross investment income 789,106 679,414 3.2 3.1 Investment expenses (9,921) (7,796) Total 779,185 671,618 3.2 3.0 
 Net investment income increased 16 to 779 million in 2022 from 672 million in 2021 due primarily to an 167 million increase in income from fixed maturity securities mainly driven by rising interest rates and a larger investment portfolio, a 21 million increase from equity securities and a 7 million increase from the arbitrage trading account, partially offset by a 75 million decrease in income from investment funds primarily due to financial service funds, an 11 million decrease in real estate and a 2 million increase in investment expenses. Investment funds are reported on a one quarter lag. The average annualized yield for fixed maturity securities was 2.9 in 2022 and 2.2 in 2021. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 2.4 years at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company maintained the shortened duration of its fixed maturity security portfolio, thereby reducing the potential impact of mark-to-market on the portfolio and positioning the Company to react quickly to changes in the current interest rate environment. Average invested assets, at cost (including cash and cash equivalents), were 24.4 billion in 2022 and 22.2 billion in 2021. 
 Insurance Service Fees . The Company earns fees from an insurance distribution business, a third-party administrator, and as a servicing carrier of workers' compensation assigned risk plans for certain states. Insurance service fees increased to 111 million in 2022 from 94 million in 2021 due to organic growth within the business. 
 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains on Investments . The Company buys and sells securities and other investment assets on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments. Decisions to sell securities and other investment assets are based on management s view of the underlying fundamentals of specific investments as well as management s expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads, currency values and general economic conditions. Net realized and unrealized gains on investments were 217 million in 2022 compared with 107 million in 2021. In 2022, the gains reflected net realized gains on investments of 218 million (primarily due to a 251 million net gain from sale of a real estate investment in London after 
 50 

transaction expenses and the foreign currency impact including reversal of the currency translation adjustment), partially offset by a change in unrealized losses on equity securities of 1 million. In 2021, the gains reflected net realized gains on investments of 145 million (primarily due to the sale of certain real estate assets and the disposition of an investment fund), partially offset by an increase in unrealized losses on equity securities of 38 million. 
 Change in Allowance for Expected Credit Losses on Investments. Based on credit factors, the allowance for expected credit losses is increased or decreased depending on the percentage of unrealized loss relative to amortized cost by security, changes in rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the pre-tax change in allowance for expected credit losses on investments increased by 15 million 12 million after-tax), which is reflected in net investment gains, primarily due to change in estimate. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the pre-tax change in allowance for expected credit losses on investments increased by 16 million 13 million after-tax), which is reflected in net investment gains, primarily related to foreign government securities which did not previously have an allowance. 
 Revenues from Non-Insurance Businesses . Revenues from non-insurance businesses were derived from businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that provide services to aviation markets, including (i) the distribution, manufacturing, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and components, (ii) the sale of new and used aircraft, and (iii) avionics, fuel, maintenance, storage and charter services. Revenues from non-insurance businesses were 510 million in 2022 and 489 million in 2021. The increase mainly relates to the business recovery from COVID-19 on promotional merchandise and textile business as well as a newly acquired commercial and residential textile business in 2022, partially offset by a decrease for the aviation-related business. 
 Losses and Loss Expenses . Losses and loss expenses increased to 5,862 million in 2022 from 4,954 million in 2021. The consolidated loss ratio was 61.3 in 2022 and 61.1 in 2021. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, were 212 million (including current accident year losses of approximately 5 million related to COVID-19) in 2022 compared with 202 million in 2021 (including losses of approximately 58 million related to COVID-19). Adverse prior year reserve development (net of premium offsets) was 36 million in 2022 and favorable prior year reserve development was 7 million in 2021 (refer to Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for more detail). The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 58.7 in both 2022 and 2021. 
 A summary of loss ratios in 2022 compared with 2021 by business segment follows: 
 Insurance - The loss ratio of 61.3 in 2022 was 0.2 points higher than the loss ratio of 61.1 in 2021. Catastrophe losses were 127 million in 2022 compared with 150 million in 2021. The Company reflected a best estimate (net of reinsurance) based upon available information for current accident year COVID-19-related losses of approximately 3 million. Adverse prior year reserve development was 40 million in 2022, driven by two businesses that wrote policies providing coverage for event cancellation, and film production delay which were heavily impacted by losses directly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable prior year reserve development was 20 million in 2021. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 59.3 in both 2022 and 2021. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess - The loss ratio of 61.3 in 2022 was 0.3 points higher than the loss ratio of 61.0 in 2021. Catastrophe losses were 85 million in 2022 compared with 52 million in 2021.The Company reflected a best estimate (net of reinsurance) based upon available information for current accident year COVID-19-related losses of approximately 2 million. Favorable prior year reserve development was 4 million in 2022, and adverse prior year reserve development was 13 million in 2021. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development decreased 0.2 points to 54.5 in 2022 from 54.7 in 2021. 
 Other Operating Costs and Expenses . Following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses: 
 (In thousands) 2022 2021 Policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses 2,673,903 2,306,727 Insurance service expenses 96,419 86,003 Net foreign currency gains (50,930) (25,725) Debt extinguishment costs 11,521 Other costs and expenses 242,113 220,744 Total 2,961,505 2,599,270 
 51 

Policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers, premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs. Policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses increased 16 from 2021, while net premiums earned increased 18 over that period. The expense ratio (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned) was 28.0 in 2022, down from 28.5 in 2021. The improvement is primarily attributable to higher net premiums earned outpacing compensation expense growth. However, to the extent our net premiums earned decrease or travel and entertainment expenses increase, our expense ratio would be expected to increase. 
 Service expenses, which represent the costs associated with the fee-based businesses, was 96 million in 2022 and 86 million in 2021 due to the organic growth within the business. 
 Net foreign currency gains result from transactions denominated in a currency other than a businesses functional currency. Net foreign currency gains was 51 million in 2022 and 26 million in 2021, mainly related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the majority of other currencies. 
 Debt extinguishment costs of 12 million in 2021 related to the redemption of 400 million of subordinated debentures in March and June 2021 that were due in 2056. 
 Other costs and expenses represent general and administrative expenses of the parent company and other expenses not allocated to business segments, including the cost of certain long-term incentive plans and new business ventures. Other costs and expenses increased to 242 million in 2022 from 221 million in 2021, primarily due to the increase in performance-based compensation costs in 2022. 
 Expenses from Non-Insurance Businesses . Expenses from non-insurance businesses represent costs associated with businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that include (i) cost of goods sold related to aircraft and products sold and services provided and (ii) general and administrative expenses. Expenses from non-insurance businesses were 493 million in 2022 compared to 472 million in 2021. The increase mainly relates to the business recovery from COVID-19 on promotional merchandise and textile business as well as a newly acquired residential and commercial textile business in 2022, partially offset by a decrease for the aviation-related business. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense was 130 million in 2022 and 147 million in 2021. In March 2021, the Company issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.55 senior notes due 2052 and redeemed its 110 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90 subordinated debentures due 2056. In June 2021, the Company redeemed the 290 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.75 subordinated debentures due 2056. In September 2021, the Company issued 350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.15 senior notes due 2061. 
 In the first quarter of 2022, the Company repaid at maturity its 77 million aggregate principal amount of 8.7 senior notes in January and its 350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 senior notes in March. The above redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in debt extinguishment costs of 12 million. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2021, the Company sold a real estate asset, which resulted in a 102 million reduction of the Company's non-recourse debt that was supporting the property. 
 The repayment at maturity and redemption of senior notes and debentures and issuance of additional senior notes and debentures in 2022 and 2021 decreased interest expense in 2022. 
 Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 19.5 in 2022 and 19.6 in 2021. The lower effective income tax rate for 2022 was primarily due to a net reduction in the Company s valuation allowance against foreign tax credits and foreign net operating losses. The effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits attributable to tax-exempt investment income and equity-based compensation in both periods. See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the income tax expense and the amounts computed by applying the Federal income tax rate of 21 . 
 The Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately 169 million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the future, if such earnings were distributed the Company projects that the incremental tax, if any, will be immaterial. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted. Among other things, the legislation introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain corporations. The tax is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and imposes a 15 minimum tax on a corporation s applicable financial statement income. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position at this time.

Investments 
 As part of its investment strategy, the Company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities that, combined with expected cash flow, it believes is adequate to meet its payment obligations. In addition to fixed-maturity securities, the Company invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. The Company's investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced, and the Company expects to continue to experience, greater fluctuations in investment income. 
 The Company also attempts to maintain an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities (i.e., policy claims and debt obligations). The effective duration of the investment portfolio was 2.4 years at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s investment portfolio and investment-related assets as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: 
 in thousands) Carrying Value Percent of Total Fixed maturity securities: U.S. government and government agencies 892,258 3.7 State and municipal: Special revenue 1,721,497 7.1 Local general obligation 441,097 1.8 State general obligation 416,713 1.7 Corporate backed 199,639 0.8 Pre-refunded (1) 158,840 0.6 Total state and municipal 2,937,786 12.0 Mortgage-backed securities: Agency 901,332 3.7 Commercial 528,609 2.2 Residential-Prime 235,315 1.0 Residential-Alt A 3,762 Total mortgage-backed securities 1,669,018 6.9 Asset-backed securities 3,982,773 16.4 Corporate: Industrial 3,252,999 13.4 Financial 2,470,372 10.2 Utilities 551,048 2.3 Other 429,573 1.7 Total corporate 6,703,992 27.6 Foreign government 1,401,522 5.8 Total fixed maturity securities 17,587,349 72.4 Equity securities available for sale: Common stocks 982,751 4.0 Preferred stocks 203,143 0.8 Total equity securities available for sale 1,185,894 4.8 Investment funds 1,608,548 6.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1,449,346 6.0 Real estate 1,340,622 5.5 Arbitrage trading account 944,230 3.9 Loans receivable 193,002 0.8 Total investments 24,308,991 100.0 
 ______________ 
 (1) Pre-refunded securities are securities for which an escrow account has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest through maturity. Such escrow accounts are funded almost exclusively with U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities. 
 Fixed Maturity Securities . The Company s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity. However, management of the available for sale 
 54 

portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations. 
 The Company s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return. The key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads and currency values. In a period in which management expects interest rates to rise, the Company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio. Similarly, in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen, the Company may sell lower quality securities, and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value, the Company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies. The sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains; however, there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods. 
 Equity Securities . Equity securities primarily represent investments in common and preferred stocks in companies with potential growth opportunities in different sectors, mainly in the financial institutions and energy sectors. 
 Investment Funds . At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of investment funds was 1,609 million, including investments in financial services funds of 466 million, other funds of 370 million (which includes a deferred compensation trust asset of 30 million), transportation funds of 337 million, real estate funds of 205 million, energy funds of 116 million, and infrastructure funds of 115 million. Investment funds are primarily reported on a one-quarter lag. 
 Real Estate . Real estate is directly owned property held for investment. At December 31, 2022, real estate properties in operation included a long-term ground lease in Washington D.C., an office complex in New York City and the completed portion of a mixed-use project in Washington D.C. In addition, part of the previously mentioned mixed-use project in Washington D.C. is under development. The Company expects to fund further development costs for the project with a combination of its own funds and external financing. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold an office building in London. 
 Arbitrage Trading Account . The arbitrage trading account is comprised of direct investments in arbitrage securities. Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers. 
 Loans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, had an amortized cost of 193 million and an aggregate fair value of 188 million at December 31, 2022. The amortized cost of loans receivable is net of an allowance for expected credit losses of 2 million as of December 31, 2022. Loans receivable include real estate loans of 174 million that are secured by commercial and residential real estate located primarily in London and New York. Real estate loans generally earn interest at fixed or stepped interest rates and have maturities through 2026. Loans receivable include commercial loans of 19 million that are secured by business assets and have fixed interest rates with varying maturities not exceeding 10 years. 
 55 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow . Cash flow provided from operating activities increased to 2,569 million in 2022 from 2,184 million in 2021, primarily due to an increase in premium receipts partially offset by increased loss and loss expense payments. 
 The Company's insurance subsidiaries' principal sources of cash are premiums, investment income, service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments. The principal uses of cash are payments for claims, taxes, operating expenses and dividends. The Company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums, investment income and fees. The Company generally targets an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within 1.5 years of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary. In the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed maturity securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements, the remainder of the Company's cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due. The Company's investment portfolio is highly liquid, with approximately 76 invested in cash, cash equivalents and marketable fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2022. If the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary, a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized. 
 Debt . At December 31, 2022, the Company had senior notes, subordinated debentures and other debt outstanding with a carrying value of 2,837 million and a face amount of 2,862 million. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company repaid at maturity its 77 million aggregate principal amount of 8.7 senior notes in January and its 350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 senior notes in March. The maturities of the outstanding debt are 5 million in 2024, 2 million in 2025, 250 million in 2037, 350 million in 2044, 470 million in 2050, 400 million in 2052, 185 million in 2058, 300 million in 2059, 250 million in 2060, and 650 million in 2061. 
 On April 1, 2022, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for revolving, unsecured borrowings up to an aggregate of 300 million with a 50 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Company may increase the amount available under the facility to a maximum of 500 million subject to obtaining lender commitments for the increase and other customary conditions. Borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. All borrowings under the facility must be repaid by April 1, 2027, except that letters of credit outstanding on that date may remain outstanding until April 1, 2028 (or such later date approved by all lenders). Our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for facilities of this type. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. 
 Equity . At December 31, 2022, total common stockholders equity was 6.7 billion, common shares outstanding were 264,546,100 and stockholders equity per outstanding share was 25.51. The Company repurchased 1,370,394 and 1,752,619 shares of its common stock in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate cost of the repurchases was 94 million in 2022 and 122 million in 2021. In 2022, the Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.09 per share in the first quarter, and 0.10 per share in each of the remaining three quarters, as well as special dividends of 0.50 per share in the second quarter, for a total of 235 million in aggregate dividends in 2022. 
 Total Capital . Total capitalization (equity, debt and subordinated debentures) was 9.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The percentage of the Company s capital attributable to senior notes, subordinated debentures and other debt was 30 and 33 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Federal and Foreign Income Taxes 
 The Company files a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a gross deferred tax asset of 801 million (which primarily relates to unrealized losses on investments, loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premium reserves). The Company also has a 47 million valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax asset and a gross deferred tax liability of 425 million (which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs, and various investment funds) resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 329 million. The realization of this asset is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on historical results and the prospects for future operations, management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset. 
 56 

Reinsurance 
 The Company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes. Reinsurance is purchased by the Company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with financially sound carriers. Reinsurance coverage and retentions vary depending on the line of business, location of the risk and nature of loss. The Company s reinsurance purchases include the following: 
 Property reinsurance treaties - The Company purchases property reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large individual property losses and catastrophe events. Following is a summary of significant property reinsurance treaties in effect as of January 1, 2023: The Company s property per risk reinsurance generally covers losses between 2.5 million and 80 million. The Company s catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program provides protection for net losses in excess of between 65 million and 80 million up to 500 million for the majority of U.S. business written by its Insurance segment businesses and U.S. and non-U.S. business written by Lloyd's Syndicate, excluding offshore energy; this includes some co-participation in lower layers. For terrorism, we currently retain the first 95 million and then fully insure above this to our desired limit of 400 million. For 2023, some of our property cat reinsurance is placed via an industry loss warranty (ILW) cover and the equivalent W. R. Berkley limit and retention (and resulting net position) are estimated based on our market share and modeled outcome when applying the ILW layering. The Company s catastrophe reinsurance agreements are subject to certain limits, exclusions and reinstatement premiums. 
 Casualty reinsurance treaties - The Company purchases casualty reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large individual casualty losses, workers compensation catastrophe losses and casualty losses involving multiple claimants or insureds for the majority of business written by its U.S. companies. A significant casualty treaty (casualty catastrophe) in effect as of January 1, 2023 provides significant protection for losses between 10 million and 60 million from single events with claims involving two or more insurable interests or for systemic events involving multiple insureds and/or policy years. The treaty also covers casualty contingency losses in excess of 5 million and up to 100 million. For losses involving two or more claimants for primary workers compensation business, coverage is generally in place for losses between 10 million and 500 million. For excess workers compensation business, such coverage is generally in place for losses between 25 million and 500 million. Our workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance program is a shared cover for both excess and primary workers compensation business. 
 Facultative reinsurance - The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain individual policies or risks that are in excess of treaty reinsurance capacity. 
 Other reinsurance - Depending on the business, the Company purchases specific additional reinsurance to supplement the above programs. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, Lifson Re will continue to be a participant on the majority of the Company s reinsurance placements for a 30.0 share of the placed amounts. This pertains to all traditional treaty reinsurance/retrocessional placements for both property and casualty business where there is more than one open market reinsurer participating. Lifson Re has been capitalized with 380 million of equity from a small group of sophisticated global investors with long-term investment horizons, including a minority participation by the Company. Lifson Re will participate on a fully collateralized basis. 
 The Company places a number of its casualty treaties on a risk attaching basis. Under risk attaching treaties, all claims from policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract. If the Company is unable to renew or replace its existing reinsurance coverage, protection for unexpired policies would remain in place until their expiration. In such case, the Company could revise its underwriting strategy for new business to reflect the absence of reinsurance protection. The casualty catastrophe treaty highlighted above was purchased on a losses discovered basis. Property catastrophe and workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance is generally placed on a losses occurring basis, whereby only claims occurring during the period are covered. If the Company is unable to renew or replace these reinsurance coverages, unexpired policies would not be protected, though we frequently have the option to purchase run-off coverage in our treaties. 
 Following is a summary of earned premiums and loss and loss expenses ceded to reinsurers for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022: Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Earned premiums 1,883,263 1,805,341 1,499,948 Losses and loss expenses 1,269,338 1,236,960 955,630 
 Ceded earned premiums increased 4.3 in 2022 to 1,883 million. The ceded losses and loss expenses ratio decreased 2 points to 67 in 2022 from 69 in 2021.

 (3) Many states require licensed insurers that provide workers' compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers' compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis. Insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies. The Company acts as a servicing carrier for workers' compensation pools in certain states. As a servicing carrier, the Company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100 of this business to the respective pool. As a servicing carrier, the Company receives fee income for its services. The Company does not retain underwriting risk, and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members.

Contractual Obligations 
 Following is a summary of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022: 
 (In thousands) Estimated Payments By Periods 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Gross reserves for losses 4,586,303 3,268,257 2,461,737 1,788,739 1,439,989 3,895,626 Operating lease obligations 47,024 41,788 32,928 25,973 16,472 68,912 Purchase obligations 148,593 51,602 51,456 53,819 52,821 55,395 Subordinated debentures 1,035,000 Senior notes and other debt 5,300 1,954 1,820,000 Interest payments 125,580 125,580 125,580 125,580 125,580 3,154,164 Other long-term liabilities 2,489 2,228 2,035 1,859 1,698 20,232 Total 4,909,989 3,494,755 2,675,690 1,995,970 1,636,560 10,049,329 
 
 The estimated payments for reserves for losses and loss expenses in the above table represent the projected (undiscounted) payments for gross loss and loss expense reserves related to losses incurred as of December 31, 2022. The estimated payments in the above table do not consider payments for losses to be incurred in future periods. These amounts include reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses. Estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers are not reflected. The estimated payments by year are based on historical loss payment patterns.The actual payments may differ from the estimated amounts due to changes in ultimate loss reserves and in the timing of the settlement of those reserves. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments to invest up to 402 million and 146 million in certain investment funds and real estate construction projects, respectively. These amounts are not included in the above table. 
 
 The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain reinsurance payments and obligations. Outstanding letters of credit were 5 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company has made certain guarantees to state regulators that the statutory capital of certain subsidiaries will be maintained above certain minimum levels. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company. The Company has no arrangements of these types that management believes may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk . The fair value of the Company s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates. The Company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk. The Company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the effective duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities (i.e., policy claims and debt obligations). The effective duration for the fixed maturity portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents) was 2.4 years at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 In addition, the fair value of the Company s international investments is subject to currency risk. The Company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate. 
 The following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their effective duration at December 31, 2022: 
 Effective Duration in thousands) (Years) Fair Value Mortgage-backed securities 4.5 1,669,056 State and municipal 3.3 2,942,025 U.S. government and government agencies 3.1 892,258 Corporate 2.7 6,703,992 Foreign government 2.2 1,401,522 Loans receivable 1.3 187,981 Asset-backed securities 0.9 3,982,773 Cash and cash equivalents 0.0 1,449,346 Total 2.4 19,228,953 
 Duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. The Company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities, assuming parallel shifts in the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static. The estimated fair value at specified levels at December 31, 2022 would be as follows: 
 (In thousands) Estimated Fair Value Change in Fair Value Change in interest rates: 300 basis point rise 17,931,180 (1,297,772) 200 basis point rise 18,344,941 (884,011) 100 basis point rise 18,778,053 (450,899) Base scenario 19,228,952 100 basis point decline 19,692,291 463,339 200 basis point decline 20,161,330 932,378 300 basis point decline 20,632,243 1,403,291 
 
 Arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period (usually four months or less). The Company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions. Potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies, including short sales. 
 Additionally, the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options, selling call options or entering into swap contracts. The Company's merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals, which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 W. R. Berkley Corporation: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W. R. Berkley Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to VI (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Reserves for losses and loss expenses 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the reserves for losses and loss expenses (reserves) using a variety of actuarial techniques and methods. The key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of recorded reserves are expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation, reported and paid loss emergence patterns, loss frequency and severity, and the loss reporting lag. Such amounts are adjusted for certain qualitative factors. The reserves as of December 31, 2022 were 17.0 billion. 
 We identified the assessment of the estimate of reserves as a critical audit matter because it involved significant measurement uncertainty, which required complex auditor judgement. Specialized actuarial skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the actuarial method or methods and assumptions used. Assumptions included loss development 
 61 

factors; the weighting of actuarial methods when more than one was used; the impact of qualitative factors; and whether payments are fixed and reliably determinable for certain reserves subject to discounting. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s reserving process. This included controls over the Company s process to develop the Company s best estimate of reserves based on actuarial methodologies and assumptions employed by the Company s actuaries. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 examining the Company s actuarial methodologies for compliance with Actuarial Standards of Practice; 
 evaluating the Company s ability to discount certain reserves by comparing the expected payout pattern of claims paid to actual claims paid; 
 evaluating the Company s actuarial point estimate by performing independent actuarial analyses for certain of the larger, more complex businesses; 
 evaluating the Company s actuarial point estimate by examining the Company actuaries process, and key assumptions for certain of the remaining businesses; 
 developing an independent range of reserves based on actuarial methodologies and assumptions and comparing to the Company s recorded reserves; 
 evaluating the Company s recorded reserves and year-over-year movements of the Company s reserves relative to, and within, the independently developed range of reserves. 
 
 / S / 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1972.

Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies which are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers.

 The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted, and may further impact, the Company s results through its effect on claim frequency and severity. Loss cost trends have been impacted and may be further impacted by COVID-19-related claims in certain lines of business. Losses incurred from COVID-19-related claims have been offset, to a certain extent, by lower claim frequency in certain lines of our businesses; however, as the economy and legal systems have reopened, the benefit of lower claim frequency has partially abated. The ultimate net impact of COVID-19 on the Company remains uncertain. New variants of the COVID-19 virus continue to create risks with respect to loss costs and the potential for renewed impact of the other effects of COVID-19 associated with economic conditions, inflation, and social distancing and work from home rules. 
 Most of the COVID-19-related claims reported to the Company to date involve certain short-tailed lines of business, including contingency and event cancellation, business interruption, and film production delay. The Company has also received COVID-19-related claims for longer-tailed casualty lines of business such as workers compensation and other liability; however, the estimated incurred loss impact for these reported claims are not material at this time. Given the continuing uncertainty regarding the pandemic's pervasiveness, the future impact that the pandemic may have on claim frequency and severity remains uncertain at this time. 
 The Company has estimated the potential COVID-19 impact to its contingency and event cancellation, workers compensation, and other lines of business under a number of possible scenarios; however, due to COVID-19 s continued

million, of which million relates to the Insurance segment and million relates to the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment. Such million of COVID-19-related losses included million of reported losses and million of IBNR. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized current accident year losses for COVID-19-related claims activity, net of reinsurance, of approximately million, of which million relates to the Insurance segment and million relates to the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment. 
 Unfavorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was million in 2022. 
 Insurance Reserves for the Insurance segment developed unfavorably by million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The unfavorable development in the segment primarily related to COVID-19 losses at two businesses. These businesses wrote policies providing coverage for event cancellation and film production delay which were heavily impacted by losses directly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of this COVID-19 related unfavorable development emerged during the third quarter as a result of settlements of claims at values higher than our expectations. However, the Company believes that as a result of these settlements the remaining level of uncertainty around the ultimate value of its known COVID-19 claims has been significantly reduced. 
 The unfavorable development mentioned above also includes favorable prior year development for the Insurance segment primarily attributable to the 2020 and 2021 accident years and unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years. The favorable development on the 2020 and 2021 accident years was concentrated in certain casualty lines of business including general liability, professional liability, and workers compensation. The Company experienced lower reported claim frequency in these lines of business during 2020 and 2021 relative to historical averages, and continued to experience lower reported incurred losses relative to our expectations for these accident years as they developed during 2022. These trends began in 2020 and we believe were caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including for example, lockdowns, reduced driving/traffic and increased work from home. Due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on accident years 2020 and 2021 incurred losses, the Company has been cautious in reacting to these lower trends in setting and updating its loss ratio estimates for these years. As these accident years have continued to mature, the Company has continued to recognize some of the favorable reported experience in its ultimate loss estimates made during 2022. 
 The unfavorable development on the 2015 through 2019 accident years was concentrated in the general liability and professional liability, including medical professional, lines of business, as well as commercial auto liability. The development was driven by a larger than expected number of large losses reported. The Company believes social inflation is contributing to an increase in the frequency of large losses for these accident years. Social inflation can include higher settlement demands from plaintiffs, use of tactics such as litigation funding by the plaintiffs bar, negative public sentiment towards large businesses and corporations, and erosion of tort reforms, among others. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Reserves for the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment developed favorably by million in 2022 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable development for the segment was driven mainly by favorable development in excess workers compensation, substantially offset by unfavorable development in the professional liability and non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability lines of business. The favorable excess workers compensation development was spread across most prior accident years, including 2012 and prior years, and was driven by a review of the Company s claim reporting patterns as well as a number of favorable claim settlements relative to expectations. The unfavorable professional liability and non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability development was concentrated mainly in accident years 2016 through 2018 and was associated primarily with our U.S. assumed reinsurance business and related to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. 
 Favorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was million in 2021. 
 Insurance Reserves for the Insurance segment developed favorably by million in 2021 (net of additional and return premiums). The overall favorable development in 2021 was attributable to favorable development on the 2020 accident year, partially offset by adverse development on the 2016 through 2019 accident years. 
 98 

million in 2021. The unfavorable development in the segment was driven by the non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability lines of business, related primarily to accident years 2017 through 2019, and was partially offset by favorable development in excess workers compensation business which was spread across many prior accident years. The unfavorable non-proportional reinsurance assumed liability and other liability development was associated with our U.S. and U.K. assumed reinsurance business, and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. 
 Favorable prior year development (net of additional and return premiums) was million in 2020. 
 Insurance - Reserves for the Insurance segment developed favorably by million in 2020 (net of additional and return premiums). Continuing the pattern seen in recent years, the overall favorable development in 2020 resulted from more significant favorable development on workers compensation business, which was partially offset by unfavorable development on professional liability, including excess professional liability 
 For workers compensation, the favorable development was spread across almost all prior accident years, including prior to 2011, but was most significant in accident years 2016 through 2019. The favorable workers compensation development reflects a continuation of the benign loss cost trends experienced during recent years, particularly the favorable claim frequency trends (i.e., number of reported claims per unit of exposure). The long term trend of declining workers compensation frequency can be attributable to improved workplace safety. Loss severity trends were also aided by our continued investment in claims handling initiatives such as medical case management services and vendor savings through usage of preferred provider networks and pharmacy benefit managers. Reported workers compensation losses in 2020 continued to be below our expectations at most of our businesses, and were below the assumptions underlying our initial loss ratio picks and our previous reserve estimates for most prior accident years. 
 For professional liability business, unfavorable development was driven mainly by large losses reported in the directors and officers D O ), lawyers professional and excess hospital professional liability lines of business. For these lines of business, we continue to see an increase in the number of large losses reported and a lengthening of the reporting tail beyond historical levels. We believe a contributing cause is rising social inflation in the form of, for example, higher jury awards on cases that go to trial, and the corresponding higher demands from plaintiffs and higher values required to reach settlement on cases that do not go to trial. The unfavorable development for professional liability affected mainly accident years 2016 through 2018. 
 Reinsurance Monoline Excess Reserves for the Reinsurance Monoline Excess segment developed unfavorably by million in 2020. The unfavorable development in the segment was driven by non-proportional assumed liability business written in both the U.S. and U.K., and was partially offset by favorable development on excess workers compensation business. The unfavorable non-proportional assumed liability development was concentrated in accident years 2014 through 2018, and related primarily to accounts insuring construction projects and professional liability exposures. 
 Environmental and Asbestos To date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company s operations, because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to 
 99 

million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. 
 Discounting The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers compensation reserves. The amount of workers compensation reserves that were discounted was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, discount rates by year ranged from to , with a weighted average discount rate of . 
 Substantially all discounted workers compensation reserves of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022) are excess workers compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period. Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company s loss payout experience. 
 The Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers compensation reserves (representing approximately of total discounted reserves at December 31, 2022), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates prescribed or permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware.

 The Company had a current tax net receivable of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million that begin to expire in 2027 and an additional million that have no expiration date. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of million as compared to million at December 31, 2021. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against the utilization of foreign tax credits and the future net operating loss carryforward benefits of certain foreign operations. The statute of limitations for the Company s U.S. Federal income tax returns has closed for all years through December 31, 2018. 
 
 The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on historical results and the prospects for future current operations, management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset. 
 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") provided for a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1, 2018. The U.S. tax law requires insurance reserves to be discounted for tax purposes. The Tax Act modified this computation. The IRS issued revised discount factors to be applied to the 2017 reserves, which increased the beginning of year 2018 deferred tax asset for loss reserve discounting. Under the related transition rule, a deferred tax liability was established which will be included in taxable income over the eight year period that began in 2018. 
 
 The Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the future, if such earnings were distributed the Company projects that the incremental tax, if any, will be immaterial.

 Statutory capital and surplus 
 The significant variances between SAP and GAAP are that for statutory purposes bonds are carried at amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are recorded in surplus, acquisition costs are charged to income as incurred, deferred Federal income taxes are subject to limitations, excess and assumed workers compensation reserves are discounted at different discount rates and certain assets designated as non-admitted assets are charged against surplus. The Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Delaware has allowed BIC to recognize a non-tabular discount on certain workers' compensation loss reserves, which is a permitted practice that differs from SAP. The effect of using this permitted practice was an increase to BIC s statutory capital and surplus by million at December 31, 2022 . 
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has risk-based capital RBC requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based formula which measures statutory capital and surplus needs based on a regulatory definition of risk in a company s mix of products and its balance sheet. This guidance is used to calculate two capital measurements: Total Adjusted Capital and RBC Authorized Control Level. Total Adjusted Capital is equal to the Company s statutory capital and surplus excluding capital and surplus derived from the use of permitted practices that differ from statutory accounting practices. RBC Authorized Control Level is the capital level used by regulatory authorities to determine whether remedial action is required. Generally, no remedial action is required if Total Adjusted Capital is or more of the RBC Authorized Control Level. At December 31, 2022, BIC s Total Adjusted Capital of billion was of its RBC Authorized Control Level.

 Treasury shares have been excluded from average outstanding shares from the date of acquisition. The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding includes the impact of common shares held in a grantor trust. The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. The difference in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is attributable entirely to the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation plans.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company has in place effective controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. 
 During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 W. R. Berkley Corporation: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited W. R. Berkley Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules II to VI (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 General 
 
 The following is a description of certain of the specific terms of each class of the Debentures. 
 
 The Debentures were initially issued in the following aggregate principal amounts 185,000,000 (2058 Debentures), 300,000,000 (2059 Debentures), 250,000,000 (2060 Debentures) and 300,000,000 (2061 Debentures). 
 
 The Debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank in right of payment and upon liquidation junior to all our existing and future senior indebtedness and are pari passu with each other and any other future Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures (as defined below). The Debentures are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries. The Debentures do not limit us or our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon our liquidation to the Debentures. 
 
 The maturity dates of the Debentures are as follows March 30, 2058 (2058 Debentures), December 30, 2059 (2059 Debentures), September 30, 2060 (2060 Debentures) and March 30, 2061 (2061 Debentures). 
 
 The Debentures were issued in a form of one or more fully registered global securities, without coupons, in denominations of 25 and multiples of 25 in excess thereof. 
 
 The Debentures are not redeemable at the option of the holder prior to maturity and will not benefit from any sinking fund. 
 
 Definitions 
 
 Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures means the (a) Debentures and (b) Indebtedness, whether outstanding on the date of the first issuance of the Debentures or thereafter created, assumed or incurred, which specifically by its terms ranks equally with and not prior to the Debentures in right of payment upon our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or similar events. The securing of any Indebtedness, otherwise constituting Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures, 
 2 

shall not be deemed to prevent such Indebtedness from constituting Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures. 
 
 Indebtedness means (a) any obligation of, or any obligation guaranteed by, us for which we are responsible or liable as obligor or otherwise including principal, premium and interest (whether accruing before or after filing of any petition in bankruptcy or any similar proceedings by or against us and whether or not allowed as a claim in bankruptcy or similar proceedings) for (i) indebtedness for money borrowed, (ii) indebtedness evidenced by securities, bonds, debentures, notes or other similar written instruments, (iii) any deferred obligation for the payment of the purchase price or conditional sale obligation of property or assets acquired other than in the ordinary course of business, (iv) all obligations for the reimbursement of any letter of credit, banker s acceptance, security purchase facility or similar credit transaction, (v) all obligations under keep-well agreements required by insurance regulators or (vi) any obligation referred to in (i) through (v) above of other persons secured by any lien on any property or asset of the Company and (b) all indebtedness for obligations to make payment in respect of derivative products such as interest and foreign exchange rate contracts, commodity contracts (including future or options contracts) swap agreements, cap agreements, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and similar arrangements, whether outstanding on the first issuance of the debentures or thereafter created, assumed or incurred. 
 Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Debentures means any Indebtedness, whether outstanding on the date of the first issuance of the Debentures or thereafter created, assumed or incurred, which specifically by its terms ranks junior to and not equally with or prior to the Debentures (and any Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures) in right of payment upon our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or similar events. The securing of any Indebtedness, otherwise constituting Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Debentures, shall not be deemed to prevent such Indebtedness from constituting Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Debentures. 
 
 Interest and Principal 
 
 The 2058 Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 5.700 , the 2059 Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 5.100 , the 2060 Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 4.250 and the 2061 Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 4.125 . 
 
 We will pay interest on the 2058 Debentures, the 2059 Debentures, the 2060 Debentures and the 2061 Debentures quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30 of each year, subject to our right to defer the payment of interest on such class of Debentures, on one or more occasions, for up to five consecutive years. We will make interest payments on the 2058 Debentures, 2059 Debentures, 2060 Debentures and 2061 Debentures to the holders of record at the close of business on March 15, June 15, September 15 or December 15, as the case may be, immediately preceding such March 30, June 30, September 30 or December 30, whether or not a business day. However, interest that we pay on the maturity date or redemption date will be payable to the person to whom the principal will be payable. 
 
 If we have exercised our right to defer interest payments on any class of Debentures, we generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of our capital stock or any of our Debentures or guarantees that rank equally with or junior to such class of Debentures upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
 
 Optional Interest Deferral 
 
 With respect to each class of Debentures, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, we may, on one or more occasions, defer interest payments on such class of Debentures for one or more optional deferral periods of up to five consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default under the terms of such class of Debentures. A deferral of interest payments cannot extend, however, 
 3 

beyond the maturity date or the earlier acceleration or redemption of such class of Debentures. During an optional deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on such class of Debentures, and deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest at the same rate, compounded quarterly as of each interest payment date to the extent permitted by applicable law. During an optional deferral period, we will be prohibited from paying current interest on such class of Debentures until we have paid all accrued and unpaid deferred interest plus any accrued interest thereon. No interest otherwise due during an optional deferral period will be due and payable on such class of Debentures until the end of such optional deferral period except upon an acceleration or redemption of such class of Debentures during such deferral period. 
 
 At the end of five years following the commencement of an optional deferral period, we must pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including compounded interest. If, at the end of any optional deferral period, we have paid all deferred interest due on such class of Debentures, including compounded interest, we can again defer interest payments on such class of Debentures as described above. 
 
 We will provide to the trustee and the holders of the applicable Debentures written notice of any deferral of interest at least one and not more than 60 business days prior to the applicable interest payment date. We have no present intention of exercising our right to defer payments of interest. 
 
 Payment Restrictions During a Deferral Period 
 With respect to each class of Debentures, after the commencement of an optional deferral period until we have paid all accrued and unpaid interest on such class of Debentures, we will not, and will not permit any of our subsidiaries to 
 declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of our capital stock (which includes Common Stock and Preferred Stock) 
 make any payment of principal, interest or premium on or repay, repurchase or redeem any Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures or Indebtedness Ranking Junior to the Debentures or 
 make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by us of any securities of any of our subsidiaries if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in right of payment to such class of Debentures 
 
 other than 
 
 dividends or distributions in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, our capital stock where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such options, warrants or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock 
 any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholder s rights plan, or the issuance of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or the redemption or repurchase of any such rights pursuant thereto

 4 

any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of our capital stock, or the capital stock of one of our subsidiaries, for any other class or series of our capital stock, or of any class or series of our Indebtedness for any class or series of our capital stock

 (i) payment of current or deferred interest on our Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures made pro rata to the amounts due on our Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures and the Debentures and (ii) payment of principal or current or deferred interest on our Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures that, if not made, would cause us to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures.

 Definitions 
 
 Tax event means that we will have received an opinion of counsel, rendered by a law firm of nationally recognized standing that is experienced in such matters, stating that, as a result of any 
 
 amendment to, or change in (including any promulgation, enactment, execution or modification of) the laws (or any regulations under those laws) of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein affecting taxation 
 
 official administrative pronouncement (including a private letter ruling, technical advice memorandum or similar pronouncement) or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying the law or regulations enumerated in the preceding bullet point, by any court, governmental agency or regulatory authority or 
 5 

threatened challenge asserted in connection with an audit of us, or a threatened challenge asserted in writing against any taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to such class of Debentures, 
 
 which amendment or change is enacted or effective or which pronouncement or decision is announced or which challenge is asserted against us or becomes publicly known on or after the original issue date of such class of Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial increase in the risk that interest accruable or payable by us on such class of Debentures is not, or will not be, deductible by us in whole or in part, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Rating agency event means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act that then publishes a rating for us (a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as such class of Debentures, which amendment, clarification or change results in (a) the shortening of the length of time of such class of Debentures are assigned a particular level of equity credit by that rating agency as compared to the length of time they would have been assigned that level of equity credit by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of such class of Debentures or (b) the lowering of the equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) assigned to such class of Debentures by that rating agency compared to the equity credit assigned by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of such class of Debentures. 
 
 Payment of Additional Amounts 
 
 We will make all payments of principal of, and premium, if any, interest and any other amounts on, or in respect of, the Debentures without withholding or deduction at source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges are required to be withheld or deducted by 
 
 the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder, of a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or 
 
 an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such laws, regulations or rulings, including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in a taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof. 
 
 If a withholding or deduction at source is required, we will, subject to certain limitations and exceptions described below, pay to the holder of any such Debenture such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount made to such holder, after the withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Debenture and the indenture to be then due and payable. 
 
 We will not be required to pay any additional amounts for or on account of 
 
 (1) any tax, fee, duty, assessment or governmental charge of whatever nature which would not have been imposed but for the fact that such holder 
 
 6 

was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment or was physically present in, the relevant taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or otherwise had some connection with the relevant taxing jurisdiction other than by reason of the mere ownership of, or receipt of payment under, such Debenture 
 
 presented such Debenture for payment in the relevant taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof, unless such Debenture could not have been presented for payment elsewhere or 
 
 presented such Debenture for payment more than 30 days after the date on which the payment in respect of such Debenture became due and payable or provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to such additional amounts if it had presented such Debenture for payment on any day within that 30-day period 
 
 (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
 
 (3) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of such Debenture to comply with any reasonable request by us addressed to the holder within 90 days of such request 
 
 to provide information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or such beneficial owner, or 
 
 to make any declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which is required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such tax, assessment or other governmental charge or 
 
 (4) any combination of items (1), (2) and (3) above. 
 
 In addition, we will not pay additional amounts with respect to any payment of principal of, or premium, if any, interest or any other amounts on, any Debenture to any holder who is a fiduciary, partnership, other fiscally transparent entity or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Debenture to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or any political subdivision or relevant taxing authority thereof or therein, to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, partner, member of such other fiscally transparent entity or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of the Debenture. 
 
 Consolidation, Amalgamations, Merger and Sales 
 
 The Indenture provides that we may not consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into any other person (whether or not affiliated with the Company), or convey, transfer or lease our properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other person (whether or not affiliated with the 
 7 

Company) to consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into the Company or convey, transfer or lease our properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company, unless 
 
 in case the Company shall consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into another person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any person, the person formed by such consolidation or amalgamation or into which the Company is merged or the person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the properties and assets of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety shall be a person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or any other country which is on the date of the Indenture a member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, all of our obligations under the Debentures and the Indenture and, for each security that by its terms provides for conversion, provide for the right to convert such security in accordance with its terms 
 
 immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing and 
 
 the trustee receives from us an officer s certificate and an opinion of counsel that the consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture. 
 
 Events of Default 
 
 An event of default with respect to each class of Debentures will occur only upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership involving us or certain of our subsidiaries (as specified in the Indenture). 
 
 The Indenture refers to breaches that are not events of default as defaults. They include, with respect to each class of Debenture, among other things 
 
 the failure to pay interest, including compounded interest, in full on such class of Debentures for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of a five-year period following the commencement of any deferral period if such deferral period has not ended prior to the conclusion of such five-year period 
 
 the failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, on, or additional amounts with respect to, such class of Debentures when due or 
 
 the failure to comply with our covenants or agreements under the Indenture or such class of Debentures. 
 
 A default also includes, for example, a failure to pay interest when due if we do not give a timely written notice of our election to commence or continue a deferral period. If we do not give a timely written notice of our election to commence or continue a deferral period and fail to pay interest when due, any holder of the applicable Debentures may seek to enforce our obligation to make the missed interest payment, including through legal process. However, there is no right of acceleration except upon the occurrence of an event of default as described above. 
 8 

If we do give a timely written notice of our election to commence or continue a deferral period on any interest payment date (and, if such notice continues a deferral period, the deferral period has not continued for five years), then no default arises from our non-payment of interest on such interest payment date. 
 
 The Indenture provides that the trustee must give holders notice of all defaults or events of default within 90 days after it becomes actually known to a responsible officer of the trustee. However, except in the case of a default in payment on the Debentures, the trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if its responsible officers determine that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such holders. 
 
 If an event of default under the Indenture occurs, the entire principal amount of the applicable Debentures will automatically become due and payable without any declaration or other action on the part of the trustee or any holder of the applicable Debentures. There is no right of acceleration in the case of any payment default or other breaches of covenants under the Indenture or the Debentures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a default in the payment of principal of or interest on a particular class of Debentures including any compound interest (and, in the case of payment of deferred interest, such failure to pay will have continued for 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the deferral period), the holder of such class of Debentures may, or, if directed by the holders of a majority in principal amount of such class of Debentures, the trustee will, subject to the conditions set forth in the indenture, demand payment of the amount then due and payable and may institute legal proceedings for the collection of such amount if we fail to make payment thereof upon demand. 
 
 With respect to each class of the Debentures, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such class of Debentures may waive any past default, except 
 
 a default in payment of principal or interest, or any additional amounts or 
 
 a default under any provision of the Indenture that itself cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holders of all outstanding Debentures of such class. 
 
 With respect to each class of the Debentures, the holders of a majority in principal amount of such class of Debentures will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. 
 
 We are required to deliver a written statement to the trustee each year that states, to the knowledge of the officer making such statement, whether we have complied with all conditions and covenants under the terms of the Indenture. 
 
 The trustee will have no right or obligation under the Indenture or otherwise to exercise any remedies on behalf of any holders of the applicable Debentures pursuant to the Indenture in connection with any default, unless such remedies are available under the Indenture and the trustee is directed to exercise such remedies by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the applicable Debentures pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Indenture. In connection with any such exercise of remedies, the trustee will be entitled to the same immunities and protections and remedial rights (other than acceleration) as if such default were an event of default. 
 
 Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 
 We may discharge certain obligations to holders of any class of Debentures that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become 
 9 

due and payable within one year, or scheduled for redemption within one year, by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars or in the Foreign Currency in which such Debentures are payable in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness on such Debentures with respect to principal and any premium, interest and additional amounts to the date of such deposit, if such Debentures have become due and payable, or to the maturity thereof, as the case may be. 
 
 Each Indenture provides that, unless the provisions of Section 4.2 thereof are made inapplicable to Debentures of or within any series pursuant to Section 3.1 thereof, we may elect either 
 
 to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to such Debentures, except for, among other things, the obligation to pay additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain events of taxation, assessment or governmental charge with respect to payments on such Debentures and other obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such Debentures, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures, to maintain an office or agency with respect to such Debentures and to hold moneys for payment in trust or 
 
 to be released from its obligations with respect to such Debentures under certain covenants as described in the related prospectus supplement, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to such Debentures. 
 
 Such defeasance or such covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars or in the Foreign Currency in which such Debentures are payable at stated maturity, or Government Obligations, or both, applicable to such Debentures which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to, such Debentures on the scheduled due dates. 
 
 Such a trust may only be established if, among other things 
 
 the applicable defeasance or covenant defeasance does not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which we are a party or by which we are bound 
 
 no event of default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of default with respect to the Debentures to be defeased will have occurred and be continuing on the date of establishment of such a trust and, with respect to defeasance only, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after such date and 
 
 we have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel, as specified in the Indenture, to the effect that the holders of such Debentures will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance or covenant defeasance had not occurred, and such opinion of counsel, in the case of defeasance, must refer to and be based upon a letter ruling of the Internal Revenue Service received by us, a Revenue Ruling published by the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable United States Federal income tax law occurring after the date of the Indenture.

 a Conversion Event occurs in respect of the Foreign Currency in which such deposit has been made 
 
 then the indebtedness represented by such Debenture will be deemed to have been, and will be, fully 
 discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of, any premium and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to, such Debenture as such Debenture becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by converting the amount or other properties so deposited in respect of such Debenture into the currency in which such Debenture becomes payable as a result of such election or such Conversion Event based on 
 
 in the case of payments made pursuant to clause (1) above, the applicable market exchange rate for such currency in effect on the second business day prior to such payment date or 
 
 with respect to a Conversion Event, the applicable market exchange rate for such Foreign Currency in effect, as nearly as feasible, at the time of the Conversion Event. 
 
 11 

Conversion Event means the cessation of use of 
 
 a Foreign Currency both by the government of the country or countries which issued such Foreign 
 Currency and for the settlement of transactions by a central bank or other public institutions of or 
 within the international banking community or 
 
 any currency unit or composite currency for the purposes for which it was established. 
 
 All payments of principal of, any premium and interest on, and any additional amounts with respect to, any Debenture that are payable in a Foreign Currency that ceases to be used by the government or governments of issuance will be made in U.S. dollars. 
 
 In the event we effect covenant defeasance with respect to any Debentures and such Debentures are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default other than an event of default with respect to any covenant as to which there has been covenant defeasance, the amount in such Foreign Currency in which such Debentures are payable, and Government Obligations on deposit with the trustee, will be sufficient to pay amounts due on such Debentures at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on such Debentures at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration . 
 
 Book-Entry and Settlement 
 
 Each class of Debentures was issued in book-entry form and represented by one or more global debentures. Beneficial interests in the global debentures are represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of the beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in DTC. Investors may elect to hold interests in a global debenture through either DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking, S.A. Clearstream ), or Euroclear Bank S.A. N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System Euroclear (in Europe), either directly if they are participants in such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers securities accounts in Clearstream s and Euroclear s names on the books of their U.S. depositaries, which in turn hold such interests in customers securities accounts in U.S. depositaries names on the books of DTC. Citibank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Clearstream, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acts as the U.S. depository for Euroclear. 
 
 Trustee and Paying Agent 
 
 BNY is the trustee under the Indenture governing the Debentures and acts as the paying agent for the Debentures. The global debentures were deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC, New York, New York, as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC. 
 
 Governing Law 
 
 The Debentures and the Indenture are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
