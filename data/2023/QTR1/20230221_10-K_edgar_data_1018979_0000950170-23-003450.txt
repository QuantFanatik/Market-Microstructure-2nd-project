PAR T I 
 
 Item 1.	 Business. 
 Overview 
 We are a specialty provider of workers compensation insurance focused on small to mid-sized employers engaged in hazardous industries, principally construction, trucking, logging and lumber, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, and maritime. Since commencing operations in 1986, we have gained significant experience underwriting the complex workers compensation exposures inherent in these industries. We provide coverage to employers under state and federal workers compensation laws. These laws prescribe wage replacement and medical care benefits that employers are obligated to provide to their employees who are injured in the course and scope of their employment. Our workers compensation insurance policies provide benefits to injured employees for, among other things, temporary or permanent disability, death and medical and hospital expenses. The benefits payable and the duration of those benefits are set by state or federal law. The benefits vary by jurisdiction, the nature and severity of the injury and the wages of the employee. The employer, who is the policyholder, pays the premiums for coverage. 
 Hazardous industry employers tend to have less frequent but more severe claims as compared to employers in other industries due to the nature of their businesses. Injuries that occur are often severe in nature including death, dismemberment, paraplegia and quadriplegia. As a result, employers engaged in hazardous industries pay substantially higher than average rates for workers compensation insurance compared to employers in other industries, as measured per payroll dollar. The higher premium rates are due to the nature of the work performed and the inherent workplace danger of our target policyholders. For example, our construction employers on average paid premium rates equal to 4.21 per 100 of payroll to obtain workers compensation coverage for all of their employees in 2022. 
 We employ a proactive, disciplined approach to underwriting employers and providing comprehensive services intended to lessen the overall incidence and cost of workplace injuries. We provide safety services at employers workplaces as a vital component of our underwriting process and to promote safer workplaces. We utilize intensive claims management practices that we believe permit us to reduce the overall cost of our claims. In addition, our premium audit services help ensure that our policyholders pay the appropriate premiums required under the terms of their policies and enable us to monitor payroll patterns that cause underwriting, safety or fraud concerns. 
 We believe that the higher premiums typically paid by our policyholders, together with our disciplined underwriting and safety, claims and audit services, provide us with the opportunity to earn attractive returns on equity. 
 AMERISAFE, Inc. is an insurance holding company, incorporated in Texas in 1985. We began operations in 1986 by focusing on workers compensation insurance for logging contractors in the southeast United States. Beginning in 1994, we expanded our focus to include the other hazardous industries we serve today. Two of our three insurance subsidiaries, American Interstate Insurance Company (AIIC) and Silver Oak Casualty, Inc. (SOCI), are domiciled in Nebraska. Our other insurance subsidiary, American Interstate Insurance Company of Texas (AIICTX), is domiciled in Texas. All three insurance subsidiaries carry an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent). 
 Competitive Advantages 
 We believe we have the following competitive advantages: 
 Focus on Hazardous Industries. We have extensive experience insuring employers engaged in hazardous industries and have a history of profitably underwriting these industries. Our specialized knowledge of these hazardous industries helps us better serve our policyholders, which leads to greater employer loyalty and policy retention. Our policy renewal rate on voluntary business that we elected to quote for renewal was 93.8 in 2022. 
 Focus on Small to Mid-Sized Employers. We believe large insurance companies generally do not target small to mid-sized employers in hazardous industries due to their smaller premium sizes, types of operations, mobile workforces and extensive service needs. We provide these employers enhanced services, including premium payment plans to better match premium payments with our policyholders payroll costs and cash flow. 
 2 

Knowledgeable, Dedicated Employees . We deliver an exceptional product with integrity through professional, knowledgeable and dedicated employees. Service is a distinguishing factor for the Company and the level of that service is dependent on the expertise and caring culture of our employees. 
 Specialized Underwriting Expertise. Based on our 37-year history of insuring employers engaged in hazardous industries, we have developed industry specific risk analysis and rating tools that support our underwriters in risk selection and pricing. We are highly disciplined when quoting and binding new and renewal business. We do not delegate underwriting authority to agencies, marketers or to any other third parties that sell our insurance. 
 Comprehensive Safety Services. We provide proactive safety reviews of employers worksites, which are often located in rural areas. These safety reviews are a vital component of our underwriting process and also assist our policyholders in loss prevention, and encourage safer workplaces by deploying experienced field safety professionals (FSPs) to our policyholders worksites. In 2022, above 90 of our new voluntary business policyholders were subject to pre-quotation safety inspections. Additionally, we perform periodic on-site safety surveys for our voluntary business policyholders. 
 Proactive Claims Management. Our employees manage substantially all of our open claims in-house, utilizing intensive claims management practices that emphasize a personalized approach, as well as quality, cost-effective medical treatment. As of December 31, 2022, open indemnity claims per field case manager (FCM) averaged 47 claims, which we believe is significantly less than the industry average. We also believe our claims management practices allow us to achieve a more favorable claim outcome, accelerate an employee s return to work, lessen the likelihood of litigation and more rapidly close claims, all of which ultimately lead to lower overall claim costs. 
 Efficient Operating Platform. Through extensive cost management initiatives, we maintain one of the most efficient operations in the workers compensation industry. In 2022, our expense ratio was 26.5 . We believe that our expense ratio is substantially lower than that of our competitors, which gives us a greater opportunity to generate underwriting profit. 
 Strategy 
 We intend to produce favorable returns on equity and increase our book value per share adjusted for dividends paid to shareholders using the following strategies: 
 Focus on Underwriting Profitability. We intend to maintain our underwriting discipline throughout market cycles with the objective of remaining profitable. Our strategy is to focus on underwriting workers compensation insurance in hazardous industries and to maintain adequate rate levels commensurate with the risks we underwrite. We will also continue to strive for improved risk selection and pricing, as well as reduced frequency and severity of claims through comprehensive workplace safety reviews, effective medical cost containment measures and rapid closing of claims through personal, direct contact with our policyholders and their employees. 
 Increase Market Penetration. Based on data received from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) we do not have more than 4.9 of the market share in any state we serve. As a result, we believe we have the opportunity to increase market penetration in each of the states in which we currently operate. Competition in our target markets is fragmented by state, employer size and industry. We believe that our specialized underwriting expertise, use of data, and safety, claims and audit services position us to profitably increase our market share in our existing principal markets, with minimal increase in field service employees. 
 Prudent and Opportunistic Geographic Expansion. While we actively market our insurance in 27 states, 46.5 of our voluntary in-force premiums were generated in the five states where we derived 5.0 or more of our gross premiums written in 2022. We are licensed in an additional 20 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our existing licenses and rate filings will expedite our ability to write policies in these markets when we decide it is prudent to do so. 
 Capitalize on Development of Information Technology Systems. We believe our underwriting and agency management system, GEAUX , along with our customized operational system, ICAMS , and the analytical data warehouse that ICAMS feeds, significantly enhance our ability to select risk, write profitable business and cost-effectively administer our billing, claims and audit functions. 
 Maintain Capital Strength. We plan to manage our capital to achieve our profitability goals while striving for optimal operating leverage for our insurance company subsidiaries. To accomplish this objective, we intend to maintain underwriting profitability throughout market cycles, optimize our use of reinsurance, deploy appropriate capital management tools, including paying dividends to shareholders, and produce an appropriate risk adjusted return on our investment portfolio.

Industry 
 Overview. Workers compensation is a statutory system under which an employer is required to pay for its employees medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation and death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. Most employers satisfy this requirement by purchasing workers compensation insurance. The principal concept underlying workers compensation laws is that employees injured in the course and scope of their employment have only the legal remedies available under workers compensation laws and do not have any other recourse against their employer. An employer s obligation to pay workers compensation does not depend on any negligence or wrongdoing on the part of the employer and exists even for injuries that result from the negligence or fault of another person, a co-employee, or, in most instances, the injured employee. 
 Workers compensation insurance policies generally provide that the insurance carrier will pay all benefits that the insured employer may become obligated to pay under applicable workers compensation laws. Each state has a regulatory and adjudicatory system that quantifies the level of wage replacement to be paid, determines the level of medical care required to be provided and the cost of temporary or permanent impairment and specifies the options in selecting medical providers available to the injured employee or the employer. These state laws generally require two types of benefits for injured employees: (1) medical benefits, which include expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of the injury, as well as any required rehabilitation, and (2) indemnity payments, which consist of temporary wage replacement, permanent disability payments and death benefits to surviving family members. To fulfill these mandated financial obligations, virtually all employers are required to purchase workers compensation insurance or, if permitted by state law or approved by the U.S. Department of Labor, to self-insure. The employers may purchase workers compensation insurance from a private insurance carrier, a state-sanctioned assigned risk pool, or a self-insurance fund, which is an entity that allows employers to obtain workers compensation coverage on a pooled basis, typically subjecting each employer to joint and several liability for the entire fund. 
 Workers compensation was the sixth-largest property and casualty insurance line in the United States in 2021, according to the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc., the NCCI. Direct premiums written in 2021 for the workers compensation insurance industry were 52 billion, and direct premiums written for the property and casualty industry as a whole were 793 billion. According to the most recent market data reported by the NCCI, which is the official rating bureau in the majority of states in which we are licensed, total premiums reported for the specific occupational class codes for which we underwrite business were 17 billion. 
 Policyholders 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 8,100 voluntary business policyholders with an average annual workers compensation policy written premium of 29,620. As of December 31, 2022, our ten largest voluntary business policyholders accounted for 2 of our in-force premiums. Our policy renewal rate on voluntary business that we elected to quote for renewal was 93.8 in 2022, 93.5 in 2021, and 94.4 in 2020. 
 In addition to our voluntary workers compensation business, we assume reinsurance premiums from mandatory pooling arrangements, and in 2022 we underwrote workers compensation policies for employers assigned to us, in each case to fulfill our obligations under residual market programs implemented by the states in which we operate. Our assigned risk business fulfilled our statutory obligation to participate in residual market plans in three states. See Regulation Residual Market Programs below. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our assigned risk business accounted for 1.1 of our gross premiums written, and our assumed premiums from mandatory pooling arrangements accounted for 2.5 of our gross premiums written.

We are selective in establishing and maintaining relationships with independent agencies. We seek to do business with those agencies that provide quality application flow from companies operating in our target industries and classes that are reasonably likely to accept our quotes. We compensate these agencies by paying a commission based on the premium collected from the policyholder. Neither our independent agencies nor our insurance agency subsidiary has authority to underwrite or bind coverage. We do not pay contingent commissions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, independent agencies accounted for 97.9 of our voluntary in-force premiums. No single independent agency accounted for more than 1.1 of our voluntary in-force premiums at that date. 
 Underwriting 
 Our underwriting strategy is to focus on employers in certain hazardous industries that operate in those states where our underwriting efforts are the most profitable and efficient. We analyze each prospective policyholder on its own merits relative to known industry trends and statistical data. Our underwriting guidelines specify that we do not write workers compensation insurance for certain hazardous activities, including sub-surface mining and manufacturing of ammunition or fireworks. 
 Underwriting is a multi-step process that begins with the receipt of an application from one of our agencies. We initially review the application to confirm that the prospective policyholder meets certain established criteria, including that the prospective policyholder is engaged in one of our targeted hazardous industries and industry classes and operates in the states we target. If the application satisfies these criteria, the application is forwarded to our underwriting department for further review. 
 Our underwriting department reviews the application to determine if the application meets our underwriting criteria and whether all required information has been provided. If additional information is required, the underwriting department requests additional information from the agency submitting the application. Once this initial review process is complete, our underwriting department requests that a pre-quotation safety inspection be performed in most cases. In 2022, 90.9 of our new voluntary business policyholders were inspected prior to our offering a premium quote. 
 After the pre-quotation safety inspection has been completed, our underwriting professionals review the results of the inspection to determine if a quote should be made and, if so, prepare the quote. The quote must be reviewed and approved by our underwriting department before the quote is delivered to the agency. 
 Pricing 
 In the majority of states, workers compensation insurance rates are based upon published loss costs. Loss costs are derived from wage and loss data reported by insurers to the state s statistical agent, which in most states is the NCCI. The state agent then promulgates loss costs for specific job descriptions or class codes. Insurers file requests for adoption of a loss cost multiplier (LCM) to be applied to the loss costs to support operating expenses and profit margins. In addition, most states allow pricing flexibility above and below the filed LCM, within certain limits. 
 We obtain approval of our rates, including our LCMs, from state regulatory authorities. To maintain rates at profitable levels, we regularly monitor and adjust our LCMs. The effective LCM for our voluntary business was 1.52 for policy year 2022, 1.53 for policy year 2021, and 1.58 for policy year 2020. If we are unable to charge rates in a particular state or industry to produce satisfactory results, we seek to control and reduce our premium volume in that state or industry and redeploy our capital in other states or industries that offer greater opportunity to earn an underwriting profit. 
 Safety 
 Our safety inspection process begins with a request from our underwriting department to perform a pre-quotation safety inspection. Our safety inspections focus on a prospective policyholder s operations, loss exposures and existing safety controls to prevent potential losses. The factors considered in our inspection include employee experience, turnover, training, previous loss history and corrective actions, and workplace conditions, including equipment condition and, where appropriate, use of fall protection, respiratory protection or other safety devices. Our FSPs typically travel to employers worksites to perform these safety inspections. These initial inspections allow our underwriting professionals to make decisions on both insurability and pricing. In certain circumstances, we will agree to provide workers compensation insurance only if the employer agrees to implement and maintain the 
 7 

safety management practices that we recommend. In 2022, above 90 of our new voluntary business policyholders were inspected prior to our offering a premium quote. The remaining voluntary business policies were not pre-quote inspected for a variety of reasons, including instances where the prospective policyholder was previously insured by us or previously inspected by us. 
 After an employer becomes a policyholder, we continue to emphasize workplace safety through periodic workplace visits, assisting the policyholder in designing and implementing enhanced safety management programs, providing safety-related information and conducting rigorous post-accident management. Generally, we may cancel or decline to renew an insurance policy if the policyholder does not implement or maintain reasonable safety management practices that we recommend. 
 Claims 
 We have structured our claims operation to provide immediate, intensive and personal management of claims to guide injured employees through medical treatment, rehabilitation and recovery, with the primary goal of returning the injured employee to work as promptly as practicable and at maximum medical improvement. We seek to limit the number of claim disputes with injured employees through early intervention in the claims process. Where possible, we purchase annuities on longer life claims to close these claims, while still providing an appropriate level of benefits to injured employees. While we seek to promptly settle valid claims, we also aggressively defend against claims we consider to be non-meritorious. 
 Our FCMs are located in the geographic areas where our policyholders are based. We believe the presence of our FCMs in the field enhances our ability to guide an injured employee to the appropriate conclusion in a friendly, dignified and supportive manner. Our FCMs have broad authority to manage claims from occurrence of a workplace injury through resolution, including authority to retain many different medical providers at our expense. Such providers comprise not only our recommended medical providers, but also nurse case managers, independent medical examiners, vocational specialists, rehabilitation specialists and other specialty providers of medical services necessary to achieve a quality outcome. 
 Following notification of a workplace injury, an FCM will contact the policyholder, the injured employee and/or the treating physician to determine the nature and severity of the injury. If a serious injury occurs, the FCM will promptly visit the injured employee or the employee s family members to discuss the benefits provided. The FCM will also visit the treating physician to discuss the proposed treatment plan. Our FCM assists the injured employee in receiving appropriate medical treatment and encourages the use of our recommended medical providers and facilities. For example, our FCM may suggest that a treating physician refer an injured worker to another physician or treatment facility that we believe has had positive outcomes for other workers with similar injuries. We actively monitor the number of open cases handled by a single FCM in order to maintain focus on each specific injured employee. As of December 31, 2022, we averaged 47 open indemnity claims per FCM, which we believe is significantly less than the industry average. 
 Locating our FCMs in the field also allows us to build professional relationships with local medical providers. In selecting medical providers, we rely, in part, on the recommendations of our FCMs who have developed professional relationships within their geographic areas. We also seek input from our policyholders and other contacts in the markets that we serve. While cost factors are considered in selecting medical providers, we consider the most important factor in the selection process to be the medical provider s ability to achieve a quality outcome. We define quality outcome as the injured worker s rapid, conclusive recovery and return to sustained, full capacity employment. 
 Premium Audits 
 We conduct premium audits on all of our voluntary business policyholders annually upon the expiration of each policy, including when the policy is renewed. The purpose of these audits is to verify that policyholders have accurately reported their payroll expenses and employee job classifications, and therefore, have paid us the premium required under the terms of their policies. In addition to annual audits, we selectively perform interim audits on new business and on certain classes of business if significant or unusual claims are filed or if the monthly reports submitted by a policyholder reflect a payroll pattern or other aberrations that cause underwriting, safety or fraud concerns. We also mitigate potential losses from under-reporting of premium, delinquent, or 
 8 

non-payment of premium by collecting a deposit from the policyholder at the inception of the policy, typically representing 15 of the total estimated annual premium. 
 Loss Reserves 
 We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid as of a given point in time. 
 In establishing our reserves, we review the results of analyses using actuarial methodologies that utilize historical loss data from our 37 years of underwriting workers compensation insurance. In evaluating the results of those analyses, our management also uses substantial judgment in considering other factors that are not considered in these actuarial analyses. These actuarial methodologies and subjective factors are described in more detail below. Our process and methodology for estimating reserves applies to both our voluntary and assigned risk business, but does not include our reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements. We record reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements as those reserves are reported to us by the pool administrators. We do not use loss discounting when we determine our reserves, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income. 
 When a claim is reported, we establish an initial case reserve for the estimated amount of our loss based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time. Generally, that case reserve is established within 14 days after the claim is reported and consists of anticipated medical costs, indemnity costs and specific adjustment expenses, which we refer to as defense and cost containment expenses (DCC). The most complex claims, involving severe injuries, may take a considerable period of time for us to establish a more precise estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim. At any point in time, the amount paid on a claim, plus the reserve for future amounts to be paid, represents the estimated total cost of the claim, or the case incurred amount. The estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors, including: 
 type of loss; 

severity of the injury or damage; 

age and occupation of the injured employee; 

estimated length of temporary disability; 

anticipated permanent disability; 

expected medical procedures, costs and duration; 

our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim; 

insurance policy provisions related to the claim, including coverage; 

jurisdiction of the occurrence; and 

other benefits defined by applicable statute. 

The case incurred amount varies over time due to uncertainties with respect to medical treatment and outcome, length and degree of disability, recurrence of injury, employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations. As changes occur, the case incurred amount is adjusted. The initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately 
 9 

paid, especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment. Changes in case incurred amounts is an important component of our historical claim data. 
 In addition to case reserves, we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and DCC expenses that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). Our IBNR reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts as well as the unpaid cost of recently reported claims for which an initial case reserve has not been established. 
 The third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our adjusting and other (AO) reserve. Our AO reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims and is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for all reported and unreported claims. 
 The final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements. The mandatory pooling arrangement reserve includes the amount reported to us by the pool administrators. 
 In establishing reserves, we rely on the analysis of the more than 235,000 claims in our 37-year history. Using statistical analyses and actuarial methods, we estimate reserves based on historical patterns of case development, payment patterns, mix of business, premium rates charged, case reserving adequacy, operational changes, adjustment philosophy and severity and duration trends. 
 We review our reserves by accident year and state on a quarterly basis. Individual open claims are reviewed more frequently and adjustments to case incurred amounts are made based on expected outcomes. The number of claims reported or occurring during a period, combined with a calculation of average case incurred amounts, and measured over time, provide the foundation for our reserve estimates. In establishing our reserve estimates, we use historical trends in claim reporting timeliness, frequency of claims in relation to earned premium or covered payroll, premium rate levels charged and case development patterns. However, the number of variables and judgments involved in establishing reserve estimates, combined with some random variation in loss development patterns, results in uncertainty regarding projected ultimate losses. As a result, our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses may be more or less than our reserve estimate. 
 Our analysis of our historical data provides the factors we use in our statistical and actuarial analysis in estimating our loss and DCC expense reserve. These factors are primarily measures over time of claims reported, average case incurred amounts, case development, duration, severity and payment patterns. However, these factors cannot be solely used as these factors do not take into consideration changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, medical inflation, employment and wage patterns, and other subjective factors. We use this combination of factors and subjective assumptions and the use of six well-accepted actuarial methods, as follows: 
 Paid Development Method uses historical, cumulative paid loss patterns to derive estimated ultimate losses by accident year based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years. 

Paid Weighted Severity Method multiplies estimated ultimate claims for each accident year by a weighted average, trended and developed severity. The ultimate claims estimate is based on paid claim count development. The selected severity for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently. 

Paid Loss Ratio Cape Cod Method similar to the paid weighted severity method, except that on-level premiums replace estimated ultimate claims, based upon paid claim count development, and loss ratios replace selected severities. The 

10 

selected ultimate loss ratio for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently. 

Incurred Development Method uses historical, cumulative incurred loss patterns to derive estimated ultimate losses by accident year based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years. 

Incurred Weighted Severity Method multiplies estimated ultimate claims for each accident year by a weighted average, trended and developed severity. The ultimate claims estimate is based on incurred claim count development. The selected severity for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently. 

Incurred Loss Ratio Cape Cod Method similar to the incurred weighted severity method, except that on-level premiums replace estimated ultimate claims, based upon incurred claim count development, and loss ratios replace selected severities. The selected ultimate loss ratio for a given accident year is derived by giving some weight to all of the accident years in the experience history rather than treating each accident year independently. 

These six methods are applied to both gross and net claims data. We then analyze the results and may emphasize or de-emphasize some or all of the outcomes to reflect our judgment of reasonableness in relation to supplementary information and operational and industry changes. These outcomes are then aggregated to produce a single weighted average point estimate that is the base estimate for loss and DCC expense reserves. 
 In determining the level of emphasis that may be placed on some or all of the methods, we review statistical information as to which methods are most appropriate, whether adjustments are appropriate within the particular methods, and if results produced by each method include inherent bias reflecting operational and industry changes. This supplementary information may include: 
 open and closed claim counts; 

statistics related to open and closed claim count percentages; 

claim closure rates; 

changes in average case reserves and average loss and DCC expenses incurred on open claims; 

reported and ultimate average case incurred changes; 

reported and projected ultimate loss ratios; and 

loss payment patterns. 

In establishing our AO reserves, we review our past adjustment expenses in relation to paid claims as well as estimated future costs based on expected claims activity and duration. 
 The sum of our net loss and DCC expense reserve, our AO reserve and our reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements is our total net reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, was 583.5 million, which includes 12.6 million in reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements as reported by the pool administrators. The estimate of our ultimate liability was derived from the process and methodology described above, which relies on substantial judgment. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating our reserves for loss and loss adjustment 
 11 

expenses. It is possible that our actual loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred may vary significantly from our estimates. We view our estimate of loss and DCC expenses as the most significant component of our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 
 Additional information regarding our reserve for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is set forth below:

Our gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses of 696.0 million as of December 31, 2022 are expected to cover all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as of that date. As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,275 open claims, with an average of 162,816 in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses per open claim. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 4,104 new claims were reported, and 4,423 claims were closed. 
 In 2022, our gross reserves decreased to 696.0 million from 745.3 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in reserves was attributable primarily to favorable development from prior accident years. In 2022, we recognized 40.6 million of favorable development for prior accident years. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,594 open claims, with an average of 162,229 in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses per open claim. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 4,310 new claims were reported, and 4,474 claims were closed. 
 In 2021, our gross reserves decreased to 745.3 million from 760.6 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in reserves was attributable primarily to favorable development from prior accident years. In 2021, there was also 61.9 million of favorable development for prior accident years. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,758 open claims, with an average of 159,849 in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses per open claim. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 4,452 new claims were reported, and 4,747 claims were closed. 
 Loss Development 
 The table below shows the net loss development for business written each year from 2012 through 2022. The table reflects the changes in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in subsequent years from the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP). 
 The first line of the table shows, for the years indicated, our liability including the incurred but not reported loss and loss adjustment expenses as originally estimated, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. For example, as of December 31, 2012, it was estimated that 515.3 million would be sufficient to settle all claims not already settled that had occurred on or prior to December 31, 2012, whether reported or unreported. The next section of the table sets forth the re-estimates in later years of incurred losses, including payments, for the years indicated. The next section of the table shows, by year, the cumulative amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense payments, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, as of the end of each succeeding year. For example, with respect to the net loss reserves of 515.3 million as of December 31, 2012, by December 31, 2022 (ten years later) 287.9 million had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of December 31, 2012. 
 13 

The gross cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents, as of December 31, 2022, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate. A deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

Investments 
 We derive net investment income from our invested assets. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was 950.5 million and the fair value of the portfolio was 926.9 million. 
 Our Board of Directors has established an investment policy governing our investments, which is reviewed at least annually. The principal objectives of our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and surplus and to maintain appropriate liquidity for corporate requirements. Additional objectives are to support our A.M. Best rating and to maximize after-tax income and total return. 
 14 

Our investment policy establishes limitations and guidelines relating to, for example, asset allocation, diversification, credit ratings and duration. We periodically review our investment portfolio with the risk committee of our Board of Directors for compliance with the policy. Our investment portfolio is managed internally. 
 We classify the majority of our fixed maturity securities as held-to-maturity. We do not reflect any changes in non-credit related unrecognized gains and losses until realized. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), management is required to estimate expected credit related losses for these securities and recognize a credit loss allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Subsequent adjustments to the estimated expected credit related losses are recognized through earnings within the category provision for investment related credit loss expense (benefit) , and adjustments to the credit loss allowance. The remainder of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. These investments are valued at fair value at the end of each period, with changes in fair value flowing through other comprehensive income. Equity securities are valued at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in net income. We generally seek to limit our holdings in equity securities to the lesser of 10 of the investment portfolio or 30 of shareholders equity, on a fair value basis. 
 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment Portfolio for further information on the composition and results of our investment portfolio.

Reinsurance 
 We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring to, or ceding, a portion of the exposure on a risk to a reinsurer. The reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a portion of our premium. The cost and limits of reinsurance we purchase can vary from year to year based upon the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and our desired level of retention. Retention refers to the amount of risk that we retain for our own account. Under excess of loss reinsurance, covered losses in excess of the retention level up to the limit of the program are paid by the reinsurer. Our excess of loss reinsurance is written in layers, in which our reinsurers accept a band of coverage up to a specified amount. Any liability exceeding the limit of the program reverts to us as the ceding company. Reinsurance does not legally discharge us from primary liability for the full amount due under our policies. However, our reinsurers are obligated to indemnify us to the extent of the coverage provided in our reinsurance agreements. 
 17 

We believe reinsurance is critical to our business. Our reinsurance purchasing strategy is to protect against unforeseen and/or catastrophic loss activity that would adversely impact our income and capital base. We generally select financially strong reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent) or better at the time we enter into a reinsurance contract. In addition, to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk on a continual basis. 
 2023 Excess of Loss Reinsurance Treaty Program 
 Effective January 1, 2023, we renewed our excess of loss reinsurance treaty program related to our voluntary and assigned risk business. The program consists of four layers of coverage. The first layer is a multi-year treaty that applies to losses incurred through December 31, 2025. The other layers are renewed annually. Our reinsurance treaty program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to 100.0 million, subject to applicable limitations, deductibles, retentions and aggregate limits. In a multi-claimant loss occurrence, the reinsurance coverage for any one individual claimant is limited to a maximum of 20.0 million, subject to applicable deductibles, retentions and aggregate limits. 
 Our retention is 2.0 million for each loss occurrence. Losses in the layer between 2.0 million and 10.0 million are ceded to a multi-year reinsurance treaty. Our second layer of reinsurance provides 10.0 million in coverage for each loss occurrence in excess of 10.0 million. Our third layer of reinsurance provides 60.0 million in coverage for each loss occurrence in excess of 20.0 million. Our fourth layer of reinsurance provides 20.0 million in coverage for each loss occurrence in excess of 80.0 million. The layers over 10.0 million provide coverage for terrorism including the use and/or dispersal of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological agents with an annual aggregate limit of 90.0 million. Layers two through four provide coverage through December 31, 2023. The aggregate limit for all other claims under all layers is 180.0 million. 
 At our option, we have the right to commute the reinsurers obligations under the agreement at any time after the end of the applicable term of the agreement. If we commute the reinsurers obligations, we are entitled to receive a portion of the premiums that were paid to the reinsurers prior to the effective dates of the applicable commutations, subject to certain adjustments provided in the agreement. 
 We have 24 reinsurers participating in our reinsurance treaty program in 2023. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of a reinsurer s A.M. Best rating to B++ (Very Good) or below, such reinsurer may be required to provide us with security for amounts due under the terms of our reinsurance program. This security may take the form of, among other things, cash advances or letters of credit. If security is required because of a ratings downgrade, the form of security must be mutually agreed to between the reinsurer and us.

Terrorism Reinsurance 
 The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the 2002 Act) was enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001. The 2002 Act has been extended periodically, most recently by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the 2019 Act). This legislation was designed to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for losses resulting from certain acts of terrorism in the United States. The 2019 Act reauthorized a federal program until 2027 that provides federal reimbursement to insurance companies for a portion of their losses arising from certain acts of terrorism and requires insurance companies to offer coverage for these acts. The program applies to insured losses arising out of acts that are certified as acts of terrorism by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States. In addition, the program does not provide any reimbursement for any portion of aggregate industry-wide insured losses from certified acts of terrorism that exceed 100.0 billion in any one year and is subject to certain other limitations and restrictions. 
 For insured losses in 2023, each insurance group is responsible for a statutory deductible under the 2019 Act that is equal to 20 of its direct earned property and casualty insurance premiums. For losses occurring in 2023, the U.S. federal government will reimburse 80 of an insurance group s covered losses over the statutory deductible. In addition, no federal reimbursement is available unless the aggregate insurance industry-wide losses from a certified act of terrorism exceeds 200.0 million for any act of terrorism. However, there is no relief from the requirement under the 2019 Act that insurance companies offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism if those acts do not cause losses exceeding these threshold amounts and thus do not result in any federal reimbursement payments. 
 Under the 2019 Act, insurance companies must offer coverage for losses due to certified acts of terrorism in their workers compensation policies. Moreover, the workers compensation laws of the various states generally do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism, including terrorism that involves the use of nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological agents. In addition, state law prohibits us from limiting our workers compensation insurance losses arising from any one catastrophe or any one claimant. We have reinsurance protection in our current reinsurance treaty program that provides coverage of up to 100 million for losses arising from acts of terrorism. This coverage is effective through December 31, 2023. The Company s 2023 catastrophe excess of loss layer for loss occurrences greater than 10 million includes coverage for losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks, subject to the deductibles, retentions, definitions and aggregate limits. 
 Technology 
 We view our information systems as an integral part of our operations. We make substantial investments in improving our systems on an ongoing basis. We provide our field premium auditors, field safety professionals and field case managers with computer and communication equipment to efficiently complete services. We deploy technology and equipment to enable remote work when needed and to ensure continuity of home office and field operations. We also deploy online solutions for our policyholders to enable timely and efficient premium payments and for our agents to improve collaboration and exchange of data in the underwriting process. Our information technology employees perform end-user support, systems development, and infrastructure operation and maintenance with limited assistance from outside vendors. 
 Competition 
 The insurance industry, in general, is highly competitive and there is significant competition in the workers compensation segment of the industry. Competition in the insurance business is based on many factors, including premium rates, policy terms, coverage availability, claims management, safety services, payment terms, types of insurance offered, overall financial strength and financial ratings assigned by independent rating organizations, such as A.M. Best. Some of the insurers with which we compete have significantly greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. We may also compete with new market entrants in the future. 
 We believe the workers compensation market for the hazardous industries we target is more fragmented and to some degree less competitive than other segments of the workers compensation market. Our competitors include other insurance companies, state insurance pools and self-insurance funds. Overall, we estimate that more than 300 insurance companies participate in the workers compensation market. The insurance companies with which we compete vary by state and by the industries we target. Market conditions are also impacted by lower estimated loss costs adopted by a number of states in which we do business. 
 Our competitive advantages include our underwriting expertise, safety services and claims management practices, our A.M. Best rating and our ability to reduce claims through implementation of our work safety programs. In addition, we believe that our insurance is competitively priced and our premium rates are typically lower than those for policyholders assigned to the state insurance pools, allowing us to provide a viable alternative for policyholders in those pools.

Human Capital 
 Throughout our 37-year history, the retention, growth and development of our employees has been critical to our success. In order to continue to deliver on our mission of providing quality insurance services to our customers, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain talented employees that are aligned with our mission. 
 As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program that is aligned with our shareholders interests. Our underwriting professionals participate in both a long-term and a short term incentive compensation programs that are paid quarterly. The long-term incentive program is based on the achievement of regional loss ratio and premium targets as determined 30 months after the beginning of the relevant incentive compensation period. The short term compensation program is based on the underwriter s achievement of bound policy targets as determined at the end of the relevant incentive compensation period. 
 Our field safety professionals (FSPs) participate in both a long-term and a short term incentive compensation program. The long-term program pays an incentive semi-annually based upon an FSP s achievement of profitable loss ratio targets and a Company net income target. The results are measured 33 months after the inception of the subject policy period. The short term incentive program under which incentives are paid quarterly are based upon an FSP s achievement of payroll frequency targets for the relative compensation period. 
 In addition, employee bonus programs in other areas of the Company help ensure our employees performance is appropriately rewarded when the Company performs well. 
 We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees as the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce. In additional to health care and 401k retirement programs, we offer wellness initiatives and time off for annual wellness exams, a floating holiday and leisure day, reimbursements of health club memberships, quarterly wellness luncheons, an annual health fair and confidential counseling services to promote a culture of wellness. 
 To assist employees in need, beginning in 2016, the Company partnered with the Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana to provide tax-free assistance to employees that have experienced a catastrophic event through an employee assistance fund. In addition to funding from the Company, this fund also allows employees to make a one-time or recurring monetary donation to assist their fellow employees. 
 We actively engage and support local communities through numerous charitable and social organizations in the communities in which we operate. We believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. To encourage a culture of giving back to the communities in which we operate, all Company employees may take advantage of paid time off for volunteer activities. 
 In 2022, AMERISAFE launched a new committee to help the Company focus our charitable giving and corporate volunteering efforts. The committee comprises employees at various levels of the Company, different departments and locations. It is responsible for selection of recipients of monetary donations over the course of each calendar year, as well as coordinating volunteer opportunities for employees to engage in within the communities we serve.

 Regulation 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 Nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Under these laws, the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time, require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of or approval for certain transactions. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation. 
 Change of Control 
 The insurance holding company laws of nearly all states require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10 or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre-notification to the insurance commissioners of a change of control of a non-domestic insurance company licensed in those states. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of AIIC, SOCI or AIICTX, including a change of control of AMERISAFE, would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is incorporated and may require pre-notification in the states where pre-notification provisions have been adopted. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. 
 These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of AMERISAFE, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of the shareholders of AMERISAFE might consider to be desirable. 
 State Insurance Regulation 
 Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. AIIC and SOCI are primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. AIICTX is primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the Texas Department of Insurance and Workers Compensation Commission. These state agencies have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, license agencies, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates in some states, periodically examine financial statements, determine the form and content of required financial statements and periodically examine market conduct. 
 Detailed annual and quarterly financial statements and other reports are required to be filed with the state insurance departments in all states in which we are licensed to transact business. The financial statements of AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are licensed to do business. 
 23 

In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. 
 Insurance agencies are also subject to regulation and supervision by the state insurance departments in the states in which they are licensed. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Amerisafe General Agency, Inc., is licensed as an insurance agent in 30 states. Amerisafe General Agency is domiciled in Louisiana and is primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the Louisiana Department of Insurance, which regulates the solicitation of insurance and the qualification and licensing of agents and agencies that may desire to conduct business in Louisiana. 
 State Insurance Department Examinations 
 We are subject to periodic examinations by the Nebraska and Texas insurance departments. As of December 31, 2022, AIIC and SOCI are undergoing an examination by the Nebraska Department of Insurance for calendar years 2018 through 2021. AIICTX is undergoing an examination by the Texas Department of Insurance in 2022 which covers calendar years 2018 through 2021. 
 Guaranty Fund Assessments 
 In most of the states where we are licensed to transact business, there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business in that state participate in a guaranty association, which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed under insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premium written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 
 Property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in us paying assessments at some future date. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact, if any, such assessments may have on our financial position or results of operations. We have established liabilities for potential state guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers becoming insolvent. 
 Residual Market Programs 
 Many of the states in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business require that all licensed insurers participate in a program to provide workers compensation insurance to those employers who have not or cannot obtain coverage from a carrier on a negotiated basis. The level of required participation in such programs is generally determined by calculating the volume of our voluntary business in that state as a percentage of all voluntary business in that state by all insurers. The resulting factor is the proportion of premium we must accept as a percentage of all of premiums in policies included in that state s residual market program. 
 
 Companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by either issuing insurance policies to employers assigned to them, or participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating companies. In 2022 and prior, we utilized both methods, depending on management s evaluation of the most cost-efficient method to adopt in each state that allows a choice of assigned risk or participation in a pooling arrangement. In 2022, we had assigned risks in three states: Alabama, Alaska, and North Carolina. In 2023, we are no longer accepting direct assignments. 
 Second Injury Funds 
 
 A number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. The state-managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self-insurers providing workers compensation coverage in the applicable state. Our recoveries from state-managed trust funds for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 3.6 million, 5.1 million and 4.5 million, respectively. Our cash paid for assessments to state-managed trust funds for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 0.1 million, 0.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively. We accrue for second injury funds relative to historical paid amounts. 
 24 

Dividend Limitations 
 Under Nebraska law, without the prior approval of the Nebraska Director of Insurance, AIIC and SOCI cannot pay dividends to their shareholder that exceed the greater of (a) 10 of statutory surplus as of the previous year end or (b) or statutory net income, excluding realized investment gains, for the preceding 12-month period. However, net income from the previous two calendar years may be carried forward to the extent that it has not already been paid out as dividends. Further, under Texas law, without the prior approval of the Texas Commissioner of Insurance, AIICTX cannot pay dividends to its shareholder in excess of the greater of 10 of statutory surplus, or statutory net income, for the preceding 12-month period. 
 Federal Law and Regulations 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived 2.8 of our voluntary in-force premiums from employers engaged in the maritime industry. As a provider of workers compensation insurance for employers engaged in the maritime industry, we are subject to the United States Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (USL H) and the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or Jones Act. We are also subject to regulations related to the USL H Act and the Jones Act. 
 The USL H Act, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, generally covers exposures on the navigable waters of the United States and in adjoining waterfront areas, including exposures resulting from stevedoring. The USL H Act requires employers to provide medical benefits, compensation for lost wages, and rehabilitation services to longshoremen, harbor workers and other maritime workers who may suffer injury, disability or death during the course and scope of their employment. The Department of Labor has the authority to require us to make deposits to serve as collateral for losses incurred under the USL H Act. 
 The Jones Act is a federal law, the maritime employer provisions of which provide injured offshore workers, or seamen, with a remedy against their employers for injuries arising from negligent acts of the employer or co-workers during the course of employment on a ship or vessel. 
 Privacy Regulations 
 In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information. Subsequently, a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues. These laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our policyholders. We may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. In 2000, the NAIC adopted the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information. We have established policies and procedures intended to ensure that we are in compliance with the privacy requirement of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 Information Security Standards 
 In 2017, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law creating rules for insurers, agents and other licensed entities covering data security, investigation and notification of breach. This includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event. Some states have adopted similar versions of the Insurance Data Security Model Law. Our policies and procedures regarding information security are intended to ensure that we are in compliance with the model law. 
 Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes 
 From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been, or are at present, being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which proposals have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC. We are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted, the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted or the effect, if any, these developments would have on our operations and financial condition.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
 The NAIC is a group formed by state insurance commissioners to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation, reporting and accounting of insurance companies. Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted. Model insurance laws, regulations and guidelines, which we refer to as the Model Laws, have been promulgated by the NAIC as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured. Adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the Model Laws is a requirement for accreditation by the NAIC. The NAIC provides authoritative guidance to insurance regulators on statutory accounting issues by promulgating and updating a codified set of statutory accounting practices in its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The Nebraska and Texas legislatures have adopted these codified statutory accounting practices. 
 
 Under Nebraska law, AIIC and SOCI are each required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of 2.0 million. Under Texas law, AIICTX is required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of 5.0 million. Property and casualty insurance companies are also subject to certain risk-based capital requirements by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is determined based on the various risk factors related to it. As of December 31, 2022, AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 The key financial ratios of the NAIC s Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS), which ratios were developed to assist insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies, are reviewed by experienced financial examiners of the NAIC and state insurance departments to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators resources. IRIS identifies 13 industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business. The 2022 IRIS results for AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX were within expected values for all 13 industry ratios. 
 Statutory Accounting Principles 
 Statutory accounting principles (SAP) are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus as regards to policyholders. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are concerned with a company s solvency, but are also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP. 
 Statutory accounting principles established by the NAIC and adopted in part by Nebraska and Texas insurance regulators, determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to AMERISAFE.

Item 1A.	Risk Fac tors. 
 In evaluating our Company, the factors described below should be considered carefully. The occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 The workers compensation insurance industry is cyclical in nature, which may affect our overall financial performance. 
 The financial performance of the workers compensation insurance industry has historically fluctuated with periods of lower premium rates and excess underwriting capacity resulting from increased competition followed by periods of higher premium rates and reduced underwriting capacity resulting from decreased competition. Although the financial performance of an individual insurance company is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most workers compensation insurance companies generally tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. Because this market cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle. We expect these cyclical patterns will cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate, which may cause the price of our common stock to be more volatile. 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively. 
 There is significant competition in the workers compensation insurance industry. We believe that our competition in the hazardous industries we target is fragmented and not dominated by one or more competitors. We compete with other insurance companies, state insurance pools and self-insurance funds. Many of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. Moreover, a number of these competitors offer other types of insurance in addition to workers compensation and can provide insurance nationwide. 
 We only offer workers compensation insurance. We have no current plans to focus our efforts on offering other types of insurance. As a result, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers compensation insurance industry could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could have a greater impact on our company because we do not sell other types of insurance. 
 We compete on the basis of many factors, including coverage availability, claims management, safety services, payment terms, premium rates, policy terms, types of insurance offered, overall financial strength, financial ratings and reputation. If any of our competitors offer premium rates, policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours, we could lose market share. No assurance can be given that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we currently operate or that we will establish a competitive position in new markets into which we may expand. 
 If we do not appropriately establish our premium rates, our results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 In general, the premium rates for our insurance policies are established when coverage is initiated and, therefore, before all of the underlying costs are known. Like other workers compensation insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. Establishing adequate rates is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses, and to earn an underwriting profit. If we fail to accurately assess the risks that we assume, we may fail to charge adequate premium rates to cover our losses and expenses, which could reduce our net income and cause us to become unprofitable. For example, when initiating coverage on a policyholder, we estimate future claims expense based, in part, on prior claims information provided by the policyholder s previous insurance carriers. If this prior claims information is not accurate, we may underprice our policy by using claims estimates that are too low. As a result, our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums. In order to set premium rates appropriately, we must: 
 collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data; 

develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulae; 

closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and 

project both frequency and severity of losses with reasonable accuracy. 

27 

We must also implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result set premium rates accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, principally: 
 insufficient reliable data; 

incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data; 

uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions; 

the complexity inherent in implementing appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies; 

costs of ongoing medical treatment; 

uncertainties inherent in accurately estimating retention, investment yields, and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses; and 

unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action. 

Consequently, we could set our premium rates too low, which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability, or we could set our premium rates too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues. 
 If we cannot sustain our relationships with independent agencies, we may be unable to operate profitably. 
 We market a substantial portion of our workers compensation insurance through independent agencies. As of December 31, 2022, independent agencies produced 97.9 of our voluntary in-force premiums. No independent agency accounted for more than 1.1 of our voluntary in-force premiums at that date. Independent agencies are not obligated to promote our insurance and may sell insurance offered by our competitors. As a result, our continued profitability depends, in part, on the marketing efforts of our independent agencies and on our ability to offer workers compensation insurance and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements of our independent agencies and their policyholders. 
 If we are unable to realize our investment objectives, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Investment income is an important component of our net income. As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, had a carrying value of 950.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022 we had 27.2 million of net investment income. Our investment portfolio is managed under investment guidelines approved by our Board of Directors, and is made up predominately of fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. Although our investment guidelines emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, our investments are subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, market illiquidity and market volatility. General economic conditions may be adversely affected by global health pandemics, U.S. involvement in hostilities with other countries and large-scale acts of terrorism, or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Increased interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio. Low interest rates could continue to have an adverse effect on our investment income. Additionally, changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on mortgage-backed securities included in our investment portfolio. 
 Similarly, during periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, the fair values of certain of our fixed maturity securities could be deemed to have a credit related loss for which the Company could be obligated to recognize an allowance for credit losses. Further, rapidly changing equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of the equity securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. 
 These and other factors affect the capital markets and, consequently, the value of our investment portfolio and our future investment income. Any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income. 
 28 

A decline in the level of business activity of our policyholders, particularly those engaged in the construction, trucking, logging and lumber, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, and maritime industries, could negatively affect our earnings and profitability. 
 In 2022, 85.6 of our gross premiums written were derived from policyholders in the construction, trucking, logging and lumber, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, and maritime industries. Because premium rates are calculated, in general, as a percentage of a policyholder s payroll expense, premiums fluctuate depending upon the level of business activity and number of employees of our policyholders. As a result, our gross premiums written are primarily dependent upon economic conditions in these industries and upon economic conditions generally. 
 Our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses. 
 We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. 
 Our pre-tax income for any period is impacted by establishing reserves for new claims as well as changes in estimates for previously reported losses. Our focus on writing workers compensation insurance for employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our experiencing fewer, but more severe, claims. The ultimate cost of resolving severe claims is difficult to predict, particularly in the period shortly after the injury occurs. Substantial judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of unreported claims, length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation in medical costs and wages, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations, and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If there are unfavorable changes affecting our assumptions, our reserves may need to be increased. When a reserve estimate is increased, the change decreases pre-tax income by a corresponding amount. 
 The effects of emerging claims and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued. For example, medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect. Changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims costs than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy. 
 The impact of pandemics could materially affect the business operations of our insurance subsidiaries and may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 It is uncertain the ultimate impact that the economic and financial disruptions related to a pandemic could have on our business. We have identified ongoing risks related to pandemics which include a decline in demand for insurance products, a reduction in hours worked by our policyholders, an inability to collect premium balances due, potential declines in the market value of our investments and the decline in interest rates on new investments. Additional risks include legislative, judicial and regulatory actions suspending cancellation of policies for non-payment of premiums, extension of grace periods for payment of premium balances, expansion of coverage to pay for losses not contemplated by our insurance policies, and an increase in frequency and severity related to compensable claims. Additional risks include an increase in costs due to delays in medical treatment and the financial burden of pandemics on the healthcare industry. 
 Changes in accounting standards or new standards, as well as assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting issues could have a material adverse effect on our capital levels and our results of operations. 
 Changes in GAAP accounting standards, guidelines and interpretations have the ability to impact our financial results especially as it relates to our significant accounting policies which are described in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in these standards, issued and promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could impact the recognition of 
 29 

revenues, expenses, taxes, investments, loss reserves and other aspects of the Company s assets and liabilities. Such changes could significantly impact our reported earnings or financial condition. 
 AMERISAFE is a holding company whose insurance subsidiaries are governed by SAP determined and promulgated by the NAIC and state departments of insurance. New standards or changes in SAP accounting standards or interpretations, especially as it relates to our significant revenues, assets, liabilities, statutory surplus, risk-based capital (RBC) ratios and dividend paying ability could have a material impact on our statutory earnings, dividend paying ability or financial condition. 
 As an insurance holding company, AMERISAFE is dependent on the results of operations of its insurance subsidiaries, and our Company s ability to pay dividends depends on the regulatory and financial capacity of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to AMERISAFE. 
 AMERISAFE is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries, including AIIC. AMERISAFE s primary assets are the capital stock of these operating subsidiaries. The ability of AMERISAFE to pay dividends to our shareholders depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to AMERISAFE. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds, and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future, including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future. As a result, AMERISAFE may not be able to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and may not receive dividends in amounts necessary to pay dividends on our capital stock. 
 A downgrade in our A.M. Best rating would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write. 
 Rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims. We are currently assigned a group letter rating of A (Excellent) from A.M. Best, which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our business. This rating is assigned to companies that, in the opinion of A.M. Best, have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards. A.M. Best considers A rated companies to have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The ratings of A.M. Best are subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. A.M. Best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities. Our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by our A.M. Best rating. Any downgrade in our rating would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with certain independent agencies. 
 Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation 
 Because we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, legislative changes may negatively impact our business. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation by the Nebraska and Texas Departments of Insurance and the insurance regulatory agencies of other states in which we are licensed and, to a lesser extent, federal regulation. State agencies have broad regulatory powers designed primarily to protect policyholders and their employees, and not our shareholders. Regulations vary from state to state, but typically address: 
 standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements; 

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of our investments; 

restrictions on the terms of the insurance policies we offer; 

restrictions on the way our premium rates are established and the premium rates we may charge; 

required reserves for unearned premiums and loss and loss adjustment expenses; 

standards for appointing general agencies; 

limitations on transactions with affiliates; 

restrictions on mergers and acquisitions; 

restrictions on the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to AMERISAFE; 

30 

certain required methods of accounting; and 

potential assessments for state guaranty funds, second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements. 

We may be unable to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations that are continually undergoing revision. In addition, we follow practices based on our interpretations of laws and regulations that we believe are generally followed by our industry. These practices may be different from interpretations of insurance regulatory agencies. As a result, insurance regulatory agencies could preclude us from conducting some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. For example, in order to enforce applicable laws and regulations or to protect policyholders, insurance regulatory agencies have relatively broad discretion to impose a variety of sanctions, including examinations, corrective orders, suspension, revocation or denial of licenses, and the takeover of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries. The extensive regulation of our business may increase the cost of our insurance and may limit our ability to obtain premium rate increases or to take other actions to increase our profitability. 
 The workers compensation system is largely regulated by state regulation. However in recent years, certain federal agencies and regulatory bodies have increased interest in more federal workers compensation oversight. Increased federal involvement has the potential to change the workers compensation structure impacting workers benefits and the method of administration. As a result, potential changes in the level of oversight to the workers compensation industry could adversely affect our operations. 
 Assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds, second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability. 
 Most states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to participate in guaranty funds, which require the insurance companies to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies. These obligations are funded by assessments, most of which are expected to continue in the future. State guaranty associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurance companies in the state based on their proportionate share of premiums written in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies are engaged. See Business Regulation in Item 1 of this report. Accordingly, the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our written premium. Some states also have laws that establish second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. These funds are supported by either assessments or premium surcharges based on case incurred losses. 
 In addition, as a condition to conducting business in some states, insurance companies are required to participate in residual market programs to provide insurance to those employers who cannot procure coverage from an insurance carrier on a negotiated basis. Insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by, among other things, participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating insurance companies. Although we price our insurance to account for obligations we may have under these pooling arrangements, we may not be successful in estimating our liability for these obligations. Accordingly, mandatory pooling arrangements may cause a decrease in our profits. 
 At December 31, 2022, we participated in mandatory pooling arrangements in 24 states and the District of Columbia. As we write policies in new states that have mandatory pooling arrangements, we will be required to participate in additional pooling arrangements. Further, the impairment, insolvency or failure of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability for other members in the pool. The effect of assessments and premium surcharges or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business. 
 Legal or other administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in various legal and other administrative proceedings involving claims arising from our insurance operations. These claims involve issues such as eligibility for workers' compensation insurance coverage or benefits, the extent of injuries, wage determinations, disability ratings, and bad faith and extra-contractual liability. We defend these claims. A significant adverse result, or multiple adverse results involving similar issues, could require us to pay significant amounts or to change the manner in which we administer claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations. 
 We may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage. 
 When writing workers compensation insurance policies, we are required by law to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism. The impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on us would depend 
 31 

upon the nature, extent, location and timing of such an act. Our 2023 reinsurance treaty program affords limited coverage for up to 100.0 million for losses arising from terrorism, subject to applicable deductibles, retentions, definitions and aggregate limits. 
 Notwithstanding the protection provided by reinsurance and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019, the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated because our reinsurance treaty program includes various sub-limits and exclusions limiting our reinsurers obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism. Accordingly, events constituting acts of terrorism may not be covered by, or may exceed the capacity of, our reinsurance and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Our Reinsurers 
 A downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of one or more of our significant reinsurers could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Our financial condition could be adversely affected if the A.M. Best rating of one or more of our significant reinsurers is downgraded. For example, our A.M. Best rating may be downgraded if our amounts recoverable from a reinsurer are significant and the A.M. Best rating of that reinsurer is downgraded. If one of our reinsurers suffers a rating downgrade, we may consider various options to lessen the impact on our financial condition, including commutation, novation and the use of letters of credit to secure amounts recoverable from reinsurers. However, these options may result in losses to our company, and there can be no assurance that we could implement any of these options. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms, our ability to write policies could be adversely affected. 
 
 We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company, called the ceding company, transfers insurance risk by sharing premiums with another insurance company, called the reinsurer. Conversely, the reinsurer receives or assumes reinsurance from the ceding company. Our 2023 reinsurance program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to 100.0 million, subject to applicable limitations, deductibles, retentions and aggregate limits. Our retention is 2.0 million for each loss occurrence. Losses in the layer between 2.0 million and 10.0 million are ceded to a multi-year reinsurance treaty. 
 The availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions and our experience with insured losses. As a result, any material changes in market conditions or our loss experience could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 If any of our current reinsurers were to terminate participation in our reinsurance treaty program, we could be exposed to an increased risk of loss. 
 When our reinsurance treaty program is terminated and we enter into a new program, any decrease in the amount of reinsurance at the time we enter into a new program, whether caused by the existence of more restrictive terms and conditions or decreased availability, will also increase our risk of loss and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently have 24 reinsurers participating in our reinsurance treaty program, and we believe that this is a sufficient number of reinsurers to provide us with the reinsurance coverage we require. However, it is possible that one or more of our current reinsurers could terminate participation in our program. In addition, we may terminate the participation of one or more of our reinsurers under certain circumstances as permitted by the terms of our reinsurance agreements. In any of these events, if our reinsurance broker is unable to reallocate the terminated reinsurance among the remaining reinsurers in the program, it could take a significant period of time to identify and negotiate agreements with one or more replacement reinsurers. During this period, we would be exposed to an increased risk of loss, the extent of which would depend on the coverage previously provided by the terminated reinsurance. 
 32 

We may not be able to recover amounts due from our reinsurers, which would adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Reinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write. We remain liable to our policyholders even if we are unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. As a result, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Losses are recovered from our reinsurers as claims are paid. In long-term workers compensation claims, the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled. Therefore, if a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its obligations to us, we would be responsible for all claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 125.7 million of recoverables from reinsurers. Of this amount, 45.1 million was unsecured. As of December 31, 2022, our largest recoverable from reinsurers included 64.0 million from Hannover Reinsurance Ireland Limited (Hannover), 11.4 million from Arch Reinsurance Company and 9.5 million from Allianz Risk Transfer AG. Each of these reinsurers have an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent) or better. No reinsurance recoverable due at December 31, 2022 was over 90 days old. If we are unable to collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers, our financial condition would be adversely impacted. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 Our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control, which fluctuation may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile. 
 The revenues and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability can be affected significantly by: 
 rising levels of claims costs, including medical and prescription drug costs, that we cannot anticipate at the time we establish our premium rates; 

fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary or deflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on our invested assets; 

changes in the frequency or severity of claims; 

the financial stability of our reinsurers and changes in the level of reinsurance capacity and our capital capacity; 

new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of liabilities of insurance companies; 

volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks; and 

price competition. 

If our revenues and results of operations fluctuate as a result of one or more of these factors, the price of our common stock may become more volatile. 
 Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the laws of the states of Texas and Nebraska could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control of our company, which could diminish the value of our common stock. 
 Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace or remove directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control of our company that shareholders might consider favorable. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect: 
 election of our directors is classified, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of our directors are elected each year; 

shareholders have limited ability to call shareholder meetings and to bring business before a meeting of shareholders; 

shareholders may not act by written consent, unless the consent is unanimous; and 

our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with such rights, preferences and privileges as the Board deems appropriate. 

33 

These provisions may make it difficult for shareholders to replace management and could have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt that is not approved by our Board of Directors, but which individual shareholders might consider favorable. 
 We are incorporated in Texas. Under the Texas Business Organizations Code, our ability to enter into a business combination with an affiliated shareholder is limited. 
 In addition, two of our three insurance company subsidiaries, AIIC and SOCI, are incorporated in Nebraska and the other, AIICTX, is incorporated in Texas. Under Nebraska and Texas insurance law, advance approval by the state insurance department is required for any change of control of an insurer. Control is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10 or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any transaction that would result in a change of control. 
 The trading price of our common stock may decline. 
 The trading price of our common stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: 
 our results of operations; 

changes in expectations as to our future results of operations, including financial estimates and projections by securities analysts and investors; 

results of operations that vary from those expected by securities analysts and investors; 

developments in the insurance or healthcare industries; 

current and expected economic conditions; 

changes in laws and regulations; 

announcements of claims against us by third parties; and 

future issuances or sales of our common stock. 

In addition, the stock market experiences significant volatility from time to time that is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 
 Securities analysts may discontinue coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 There is no assurance that securities analysts will continue to cover our company. If securities analysts do not cover our company, this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock, the trading price of our common stock may decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 
 Future sales of our common stock may affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common stock, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares at a time and price that you determine appropriate. As of February 15, 2023, there were 19,155,873 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
 34 

General Risk Factors 
 Technology breaches or failures, including those resulting from a malicious cyber attack on us, or our policyholders or service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business. 
 We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between our employees, our policyholders and service providers depend on information technology and electronic information exchange. Like all companies, our information technology systems are vulnerable to data breaches, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond our control, including natural disasters, theft, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and general technology failures. 
 We have established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures in an effort to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to these systems and any data processed and/or stored in these systems. We evaluate the adequacy of our third-party service providers cybersecurity measures through periodic due diligence and contractual obligations. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems or our providers are possible and may negatively impact our business. 
 Although we have experienced no known cases involving unauthorized access to our information technology systems and data or unauthorized appropriation of such data to date, we have no assurance that such technology breaches will not occur in the future. 
 The expertise, wellbeing and resiliency of our workforce is necessary to maintain our competitive advantages in the high hazard workers compensation industry. 
 Our success is dependent on the expertise, wellbeing and resiliency of our employees and our ongoing leadership development activities to attract and retain key employees that are knowledgeable about our business. Succession planning and employee education and development for key positions is essential. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees and provide them with opportunities to learn and grow, our operations may be adversely impacted. 
 Our business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agencies that sell our insurance. 
 Our success is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets and relationships with our independent agencies. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Should any of our executive officers cease working for us, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the workers compensation insurance industry and the hazardous industries that we target. As a result, our operations may be disrupted and our business may be adversely affected. We do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers. 
 Economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Negative trends in business investment, consumer confidence and spending, significant declines and volatility of the capital markets, and availability of credit and the rate of unemployment can adversely affect our business. Although we continue to closely monitor market conditions, we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our premium volume, the value of our investment portfolio and our financial performance. As a result of economic conditions, we could experience future decreases in business activity and incur realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 An inability to effectively manage our operations could make it difficult for us to compete and could affect our ability to operate profitably. 
 Our continuing strategic options include expanding in our existing markets, entering new geographic markets and further developing our agency relationships. Our strategy is subject to various risks, including risks associated with our ability to: 
 profitably increase our business in existing markets; 

identify profitable new geographic markets for entry; 

attract and retain qualified personnel for expanded operations; 

35 

identify, recruit and integrate new independent agencies; and 

augment our internal operations and systems as we expand our business. 

We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may be available only on unfavorable terms. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including state regulatory requirements, the financial stability of our reinsurers and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims. We may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth if the capital of our insurance subsidiaries is insufficient to support future operating requirements and/or cover claims. If we had to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing might not be available to us or might be available only on terms that are not favorable. Future equity offerings could be dilutive to our shareholders and the equity securities issued in any offering may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. 
 If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.

 AMERISAFE is a holding company and has no direct operations. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Our insurance company subsidiaries are regulated insurance companies and therefore are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. See Business Regulation Dividend Limitations in Item 1 of this report. 
 Our existing revolving credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. For more information on our credit agreement, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of this report.

Item 7.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The financial and business analysis below provides information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in Item 1A of this report. These factors could cause our actual results in 2023 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, those forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 AMERISAFE is a holding company that markets and underwrites workers compensation insurance through its insurance subsidiaries. Workers compensation insurance covers statutorily prescribed benefits that employers are obligated to provide to their employees who are injured in the course and scope of their employment. Our business strategy is focused on providing this coverage to small to mid-sized employers engaged in hazardous industries, principally construction, trucking, logging and lumber, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, and maritime. Employers engaged in hazardous industries pay substantially higher than average rates for workers compensation insurance compared to employers in other industries, as measured per payroll dollar. The higher premium rates are due to the nature of the work performed and the inherent workplace danger of our target employers. Hazardous industry employers also tend to have less frequent but more severe claims as compared to employers in other industries due to the nature of their businesses. We provide proactive safety reviews of employers workplaces. These safety reviews are a vital component of our underwriting process and also promote safer workplaces. We utilize intensive claims management practices that we believe permit us to reduce the overall cost of our claims. In addition, our audit services ensure that our policyholders pay the appropriate premiums required under the terms of their policies and enable us to monitor payroll patterns that cause underwriting, safety or fraud concerns. We believe that the higher premiums typically paid by our policyholders, together with our disciplined underwriting and safety, claims and audit services, provide us with the opportunity to earn attractive returns for our shareholders. 
 We actively market our insurance in 27 states through independent agencies, as well as through our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary. We are also licensed in an additional 20 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 Two of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our performance are return on average equity and growth in book value per share adjusted for dividends paid to shareholders. We calculate return on average equity by dividing annual net income by the average of annual shareholders equity. Our return on average equity was 15.5 in 2022, 15.7 in 2021 and 19.9 in 2020. We calculate book value per share by dividing ending shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding. Our book value per share was 16.57 at December 31, 2022, 20.62 at December 31, 2021 and 22.70 at December 31, 2020. We paid cash dividends of 5.24 per share in 2022, 5.16 per share in 2021 and 4.58 per share in 2020. 
 Investment income is an important element of our net income. Because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer, we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time. As a result, we are able to generate more investment income from our premiums as compared to insurance companies that operate in other lines of business that pay claims more quickly. At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was 950.5 million and produced net investment income of 27.2 million in 2022, 25.4 million in 2021 and 29.4 million in 2020. 
 The use of reinsurance is an important component of our business strategy. We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Our reinsurance program for 2023 includes 24 reinsurers that provide coverage to us in excess of a certain specified loss amount, or retention level. Our 2023 reinsurance program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to 100.0 million, subject to applicable limitations, deductibles, retentions and aggregate limits. However, for any loss occurrence involving only one claimant, our reinsurance coverage is limited to 20.0 million, subject to applicable deductibles, retentions and aggregate limits. Losses in the layer between 2.0 million and 10.0 million are ceded to a multi-year reinsurance treaty. As losses are incurred and recorded, we record amounts recoverable from reinsurers for the portion of the losses ceded to our reinsurers. 
 Our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, there are no policy limits on the liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance. Therefore, estimating reserves 
 39 

for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance claims with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts. 
 Our focus on providing workers compensation insurance to employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our receiving relatively fewer but more severe claims than many other workers compensation insurance companies. Severe claims, which we define as claims having an estimated ultimate cost of more than 1.0 million, usually have a material effect on each accident year s loss reserves (and our reported results of operations) as a result of both the number of severe claims reported in any year and the timing of claims in the year. As a result of our focus on higher severity, lower frequency business, our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses may have greater volatility than other workers compensation insurance companies. 
 For example, for the five-year period ended December 31, 2022 we had recorded 81 severe claims, or an average of 16 severe claims per year for accident years 2018 through 2022. The number of severe claims in any one accident year in this five-year period ranged from a low of 13 in 2022 and 2018 to a high of 20 in 2021. The average reported case severity for these claims ranged from 1.96 million for the 2022 accident year to 3.6 million for the 2021 accident year. For the five accident years, the case incurred for these severe claims accounted for an average of 14.5 percentage points of our overall loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) ratio measured at December 31, 2022. 
 Further, the ultimate cost of severe claims is more difficult to estimate, principally due to uncertainties as to medical treatment and outcome and the length and degree of disability. Because of these uncertainties, the estimate of the ultimate cost of severe claims can vary significantly as more information becomes available. As a result, at year end, the case reserve for a severe claim reported early in the year may be more accurate than the case reserve established for a severe claim reported late in the year. 
 A key assumption used by management in establishing loss reserves is that average per claim case incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses will increase year over year. We believe this increase primarily reflects medical and wage inflation and utilization. However, changes in per average claim case incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses can also be affected by frequency of severe claims in the applicable accident years. 
 As more fully described in Business Loss Reserves in Item 1 of this report, the estimate for loss and loss adjustment expenses is established based upon management s analysis of historical data, and factors and trends derived from that data, including claims reported, average claim amount incurred, case development, duration, severity and payment patterns, as well as subjective assumptions. This analysis includes reviews of case reserves for individual open severe claims in the current and prior years. Management reviews the outcomes from actuarial analyses to confirm the reasonableness of its reserve estimate. 
 Substantial judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of unreported claims, length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, utilization, inflation in medical costs and wages, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If we change our estimates, these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which the changes occurred, with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings. Additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarial methods and other factors used in establishing these reserves can be found under the caption Business Loss Reserves in Item 1 of this report. 
 Our gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 696.0 million, 745.3 million and 760.6 million, respectively. As a percentage of gross reserves at year end, IBNR represented 17.1 in 2022, 16.1 in 2021 and 16.8 in 2020. 
 In 2022, we decreased our estimates for prior year loss reserves by 40.6 million. In 2021, we decreased our estimates for prior year loss reserves by 61.9 million. In 2020, we decreased our estimates for prior year loss reserves by 63.5 million. 
 The workers compensation insurance industry is cyclical in nature and influenced by many factors, including price competition, medical cost increases, natural and man-made disasters, changes in interest rates, changes in state laws and regulations, and general economic conditions. A hard market in our industry is characterized by decreased competition that results in higher premium rates, more restrictive policy coverage terms, and lower commissions paid to agencies. In contrast, a soft market is characterized by increased competition that results in lower premium rates, expanded policy coverage terms, and higher commissions paid to agencies. Our strategy is to focus on maintaining underwriting profitability throughout the cycle.

Principal Revenue and Expense Items 
 Our revenues consist primarily of the following: 
 Net Premiums Earned. Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written. Net premiums written is equal to gross premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Gross premiums written includes the estimated annual premiums from each insurance policy we write in our voluntary and assigned risk businesses during a reporting period based on the policy effective date or the date the policy is bound, whichever is later. 
 Premiums are earned on a daily pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies typically have a term of one year. Thus, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2022 for an employer with constant payroll during the term of the policy, we would earn half of the premiums in 2022 and the other half in 2023. On a monthly basis, we also recognize net premiums earned from mandatory pooling arrangements. 
 We estimate the annual premiums to be paid by our policyholders when we issue the policies and record those amounts on our balance sheet as premiums receivable. We conduct premium audits on all of our voluntary business policyholders annually, upon the expiration of each policy, including when the policy is renewed. The purpose of these audits is to verify that policyholders have accurately reported their payroll expenses and employee job classifications, and therefore have paid us the premium required under the terms of the policies. The difference between the estimated premium and the ultimate premium is referred to as earned but unbilled premium, or EBUB premium. EBUB premium is subject to significant variability and can either increase or decrease earned premium based upon several factors, including changes in premium growth, industry mix and economic conditions. Due to the timing of audits and other adjustments, the ultimate premium earned is generally not determined for several months after the expiration of the policy. 
 We review the estimate of EBUB premiums on a quarterly basis using historical data and applying various assumptions based on the current market and economic conditions, and we record an adjustment to premium, related losses, and expenses as warranted. 
 Net Investment Income and Net Realized Gains and Losses on Investments. We invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities in fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments. In addition, a portion of these funds are held in cash and cash equivalents to pay current claims. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities. We assess the performance of our investment portfolio using a standard tax equivalent yield metric. Investment income that is tax-exempt is increased by our marginal federal tax rate to express yield on tax-exempt securities on the same basis as taxable securities. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their cost or amortized cost, as applicable. We classify the majority of our fixed maturity securities as held-to-maturity. The remainder of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Net unrealized gains or losses on our securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet. Changes in net unrealized gains or losses on our equity securities are recognized in net income. 
 Fee and Other Income. We recognize commission income earned on policies issued by other carriers that are sold by our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary as the related services are performed. We also recognize a small portion of interest income from mandatory pooling arrangements in which we participate. 
 Our expenses consist primarily of the following: 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred. Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred represents our largest expense item and, for any given reporting period, includes estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending, and administering claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations and statistical analyses. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for our more serious claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of the injured employees. Our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability. Additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarial methods and other factors used in establishing these reserves can be found under the caption Business Loss Reserves in Item 1 of this report. 
 41 

Underwriting and Certain Other Operating Costs. Underwriting and certain other operating costs are those expenses that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue. These expenses include state and local premium taxes and fees and other operating costs, offset by commissions we receive from reinsurers under our reinsurance treaty programs. We pay state and local taxes, licenses and fees, assessments, and contributions to state workers compensation security funds based on premiums. In addition, other operating costs include general and administrative expenses, excluding commissions and salaries and benefits, incurred at both the insurance company and corporate level. 
 Commissions. We pay commissions to our subsidiary insurance agency and to the independent agencies that sell our insurance based on premiums collected from policyholders. 
 Salaries and Benefits. We pay salaries and provide benefits to our employees. 
 Policyholder Dividends. In limited circumstances, we pay dividends to policyholders in particular states as an underwriting incentive. 
 Income Tax Expense. We incur federal, state, and local income tax expense. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Understanding our accounting policies is key to understanding our financial statements. Management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates. 
 Management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from reinsurers, premiums receivable, assessments, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, credit losses on investment securities and share-based compensation. 
 The following is a description of our critical accounting policies. 
 Reserves for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses, which include defense and cost containment (DCC) and adjusting and other (AO) expenses, related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances. 
 Our reserves for loss and DCC expenses are estimated using case-by-case valuations based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time. In addition to these case reserves, we establish reserves on an aggregate basis that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). Our IBNR reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts as well as for recently reported claims which an initial case reserve has not been established. The third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our AO reserve. Our AO reserve is established for those future claims administration costs that cannot be allocated directly to individual claims. The final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements. 
 In establishing our reserves, we review the results of analyses using actuarial methods that utilize historical loss data from our more than 37 years of underwriting workers compensation insurance. The actuarial analysis of our historical data provides the factors we use in estimating our loss reserves. These factors are primarily measures over time of the number of claims paid and reported, average paid and incurred claim amounts, claim closure rates and claim payment patterns. In evaluating the results of our analyses, management also uses substantial judgment in considering other factors that are not considered in these actuarial analyses, including changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, employment and wage patterns, insurance policy coverage interpretations, judicial determinations and other subjective factors. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may vary significantly from our original estimates. 
 42 

On a quarterly basis, we review our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses to determine whether adjustments are required. Any resulting adjustments are included in the results for the current period. In establishing our reserves, we do not use loss discounting, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income. Additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarial methods and other factors used in establishing these reserves can be found under the caption Business Loss Reserves in Item 1 of this report. 
 Amounts Recoverable from Reinsurers. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the portion of our paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses that are assumed by reinsurers and related commissions due from reinsurers. These amounts are separately reported on our balance sheet as assets net of an allowance for credit losses and do not reduce our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses because reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our policyholders. We are required to pay claims even if a reinsurer fails to pay us under the terms of a reinsurance contract. We calculate amounts recoverable from reinsurers based on our estimates of the underlying loss and loss adjustment expenses, as well as the terms and conditions of our reinsurance contracts, which could be subject to interpretation. In addition, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, which can be significant because some of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for which we have reinsurance coverage remain outstanding for extended periods of time. 
 Premiums Receivable. Premiums receivable represents premium-related balances due from our policyholders based on annual premiums for policies written, including surcharges and deposits and adjustments for premium audits, endorsements, cancellations, cash transactions and charge offs. The balance is shown net of an allowance for credit losses and includes an estimate for EBUB. The EBUB estimate is subject to significant variability and can either increase or decrease premiums receivable and earned premiums based upon several factors, including changes in premium growth, industry mix and economic conditions. EBUB assumptions include historical development factors, current economic outlook and current trends in particular sectors of our business. 
 Assessments. We are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities, including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds. Our accrual is based on historical assessments as well as updated assessment rates. Assessments based on premiums are recorded as an expense as premiums are earned and generally paid one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written. Assessments based on losses are recorded as an expense as losses are incurred and are generally paid within one year of the calendar year in which the claims are paid by us. State guaranty fund assessments are used by state insurance oversight agencies to pay claims of policyholders of impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies. Second injury funds are used by states to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. In some states, these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes. 
 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. We defer commission expenses, premium taxes and certain marketing, sales, underwriting and safety costs that vary with and primarily relate to the successful acquisition of insurance policies. These acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned. In calculating deferred policy acquisition costs, these costs are limited to their estimated realizable value, which gives effect to the premiums to be earned, anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs we expect to incur as the premiums are earned, less related net investment income. Judgments as to the ultimate recoverability of these deferred policy acquisition costs are highly dependent upon estimated future profitability of unearned premiums. If the unearned premiums were less than our expected claims and expenses after considering investment income, we would reduce the deferred costs. 
 Deferred Income Taxes. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change impacts our net income or loss in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change. 
 In assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. If necessary, we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. 
 43 

Credit Losses on Investment Securities. Investment securities are recorded on the balance sheet as assets net of an allowance for credit losses. For held-to-maturity fixed income securities, the allowance is based on historical default and recovery rates as published by Moody s analytics for corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and other types of fixed income securities. For available-for-sale fixed income securities, a credit allowance is established if the expected discounted future cash flows no longer exceed the book value of the security. In determining the amount of the credit loss to establish, the Company considers the following factors: 
 The extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis 

Adverse conditions in the security, industry, or geography, including: 

Changes in technology 

Discontinuation of a segment of business that may affect future earnings 

Changes in the quality of the credit enhancement, if any 

Changes in the payment structure of debt security 

Failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments 

Any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 

Share-Based Compensation. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , we recognize compensation costs for restricted stock, performance-based stock and stock option awards over the applicable vesting periods.

Overview of Operating Results 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Gross Premiums Written . Gross premiums written for 2022 were 276.1 million, compared to 278.3 million for 2021, a decrease of 0.8 . The decrease was attributable to a 16.0 million decrease in annual premiums on voluntary policies written during the period primarily driven by continued declines in state approved loss costs. Assumed premium from mandatory pooling arrangements decreased 1.7 million. The decreases were partially offset by a 15.2 million increase in premiums resulting from payroll audits and related premium adjustments for policies written in previous quarters. 
 Net Premiums Written. Net premiums written for 2022 were 265.6 million, compared to 267.8 million for 2021, a decrease of 0.8 . The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross premiums written. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, ceded premiums were 3.7 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Reinsurance. 
 Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for 2022 were 271.7 million, compared to 276.0 million for 2021, a decrease of 1.6 . The decrease was attributable to the decrease in net premiums written during the period. 
 Net Investment Income. Net investment income in 2022 was 27.2 million, an increase of 7.0 from the 25.4 million reported in 2021. The increase was due to higher interest rates on cash and fixed income securities in 2022 compared with 2021. The average pre-tax investment yield on our investment portfolio was 2.7 per annum for 2022 versus 2.3 per annum for 2021. The year-end tax-equivalent yield on our investment portfolio was 3.4 per annum for 2022, compared to 2.7 per annum for 2021. The tax-equivalent yield is calculated using the effective interest rate and the appropriate marginal tax rate. Average invested assets, including cash and cash equivalents, decreased 8.7 , from an average of 1,151.8 million for 2021 to an average of 1,051.2 million for 2022. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments. Net realized gains on investments in 2022 totaled 3.4 million, compared to gains of 1.7 million in 2021. In 2022, net realized gains resulted primarily from the sale of equity securities. In 2021, net realized gains of 1.7 million resulted from the sale of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. 
 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities . Net unrealized losses on equity securities in 2022 were 8.1 million compared to net unrealized gains of 12.3 million in 2021 due to declines in the equity markets. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred. Loss and LAE incurred totaled 152.3 million for 2022, compared to 160.8 million for 2021, a decrease of 8.5 million, or 5.3 . The current accident year losses and LAE incurred were 192.9 million, or 71.0 of net premiums earned, compared to 222.7 million, or 80.7 of net premiums earned for 2021. We recorded favorable prior accident year development of 40.6 million in 2022, compared to 61.9 million in 2021. This is discussed in more detail below in Prior Year Development. Our net loss ratio was 56.1 for 2022 and 58.3 for 2021. 
 Underwriting and Certain Other Operating Costs, Commissions and Salaries and Benefits. Underwriting and certain other operating costs, commissions and salaries and benefits for 2022 were 72.0 million, compared to 72.1 million for 2021. The Company experienced a 1.7 million decrease in insurance related assessments and a 1.4 million decrease in accounts receivable write-offs mostly on assumed premium from mandatory pooling arrangements. The decrease in insurance related assessments included a benefit of 3.8 million in 2022 due to the return of assessments from the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Association. Offsetting these amounts were a 0.9 million decrease in profit sharing reinsurance commission, an increase of 0.6 million in systems cost, and an increase of 0.6 million in compensation expense. Our underwriting expense ratio increased to 26.5 in 2022 from 26.1 in 2021. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for 2022 was 12.0 million, compared to 13.7 million for 2021. The effective tax rate also increased to 17.8 for 2022, compared to 17.2 for 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a lower proportion of tax-exempt income to underwriting income in 2022 relative to 2021.

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 Gross Premiums Written . Gross premiums written for 2021 were 278.3 million, compared to 303.1 million for 2020, a decrease of 8.2 . The decrease was attributable to a 18.0 million decrease in annual premiums on voluntary policies written during the period primarily driven by continued declines in state approved loss costs. Premiums resulting from payroll audits and related premium adjustments for policies written in previous periods decreased by 7.7 million. The decreases were offset by a 0.8 million increase in assumed premium from mandatory pooling arrangements. Payroll audits completed this year included periods of activity impacted by COVID-19. Related premium adjustments in 2021 include a 1.6 million increase in earned but unbilled, or EBUB, premium. 
 Net Premiums Written. Net premiums written for 2021 were 267.8 million, compared to 292.8 million for 2020, a decrease of 8.5 . The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross premiums written. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, ceded premiums were 3.7 for 2021 compared to 3.3 for 2020. The increase in ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned reflects additional ceded premium of 0.6 million resulting from excess ceded losses. For additional information, see Item 1, Business Reinsurance. 
 Net Premiums Earned . Net premiums earned for 2021 were 276.0 million, compared to 304.4 million for 2020, a decrease of 9.3 . The decrease was attributable to the decrease in net premiums written during the period. 
 Net Investment Income. Net investment income in 2021 was 25.4 million, a decrease of 13.4 from the 29.4 million reported in 2020. The decrease was due to lower interest rates on fixed income securities in 2021 compared with 2020. The pre-tax investment yield on our investment portfolio was 2.3 per annum for 2021 versus 2.5 per annum for 2020. The tax-equivalent yield on our investment portfolio was 2.7 per annum for 2021, compared to 2.9 per annum for 2020. The tax-equivalent yield is calculated using the effective interest rate and the appropriate marginal tax rate. Average invested assets, including cash and cash equivalents, decreased 3.3 , from an average of 1,191.7 million for 2020 to an average of 1,151.8 million for 2021. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments. Net realized gains on investments in 2021 totaled 1.7 million, compared to 1.1 million in 2020. In 2021, net realized gains of 1.7 million resulted from the sale of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. In 2020, net realized gains of 1.0 million resulted from the sale of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale and 0.1 million from redemptions of fixed maturity securities. 
 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities . Net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2021 were 12.3 million compared to net unrealized gains of 4.2 million in 2020 due to strong appreciation of our common stock investments in 2021. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred. Loss and LAE incurred totaled 160.8 million for 2021, compared to 157.2 million for 2020, an increase of 3.6 million, or 2.3 . The current accident year losses and LAE incurred were 222.7 million, or 80.7 of net premiums earned, compared to 220.7 million, or 72.5 of net premiums earned for 2020. We recorded favorable prior accident year development of 61.9 million in 2021, compared to 63.5 million in 2020. Our net loss ratio was 58.3 for 2021 and 51.6 for 2020. The increase in the 2021 accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and net loss ratios resulted from a catastrophic claim reported in the year. 
 Underwriting and Certain Other Operating Costs, Commissions and Salaries and Benefits. Underwriting and certain other operating costs, commissions and salaries and benefits for 2021 were 72.1 million, compared to 71.9 million for 2020, an increase of 0.1 million, or 0.2 . This increase was primarily due to a 2.7 million increase in insurance related assessments, a 1.7 million increase in accounts receivable write-offs mostly on assumed premium from mandatory pooling arrangements, and a 0.7 million increase in professional fees. The increase in insurance related assessments resulted from a benefit of 5.7 million recorded in the prior year due to the early termination of an assessment related to a state multiple injury fund. The increases above were partially offset by a decrease of 2.0 million in compensation expense, a decrease of 1.9 million in commission expense, an increase of 1.0 million in profit sharing reinsurance commission, and a decrease of 0.7 million in premium taxes. Our underwriting expense ratio increased to 26.1 in 2021 from 23.6 in 2020. 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for 2021 was 13.7 million, compared to 20.3 million for 2020. The effective tax rate also decreased to 17.2 for 2021, compared to 19.0 for 2020. This decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a higher proportion of tax-exempt income to underwriting income in 2021 relative to 2020 and a reduction in a valuation allowance on deferred state tax assets.

At December 31, 2022, our incurred amounts for certain accident years, particularly 2017 through 2020, developed more favorably than management previously expected. Multiple factors can cause loss development both unfavorable and favorable. The favorable loss development we experienced across accident years was largely due to two factors: (1) lower than expected severity of injuries in these accident years compared to our original and revised estimates; and (2) favorable case reserve development from closed claims and claims where the worker had reached maximum medical improvement. We believe the favorable case reserve development resulted primarily from an intensive claims management focus with the Company actively seeking to settle claims, leading to favorable development. 
 The assumptions we used in establishing our reserves for these accident years were based on our historical claims data. However, as of December 31, 2022, actual results for these accident years have been better than our assumptions would have predicted. We do not presently intend to modify our assumptions for establishing reserves in light of recent results. However, if actual results for current and future accident years are consistent with, or different than, our results in these recent accident years, our historical claims data will reflect this change and, over time, will impact the reserves we establish for future claims. 
 Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are inherently uncertain and our focus on providing workers compensation insurance to employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our receiving relatively fewer but more severe claims than many other workers compensation insurance companies. As a result of this focus on higher severity, lower frequency business, our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses may have greater volatility than other workers compensation insurance companies. Additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarial methods and other factors used in establishing these reserves can be found under the caption Business Loss Reserves in Item 1 of this report. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of operating funds are premiums, investment income, and proceeds from maturities of investments. Our primary uses of operating funds include payments for claims and operating expenses. We pay claims, operating expenses, shareholder dividends and repurchases using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash in fixed maturity and equity securities. We expect that our projected cash flow from operations will provide us sufficient liquidity to fund future operations, including payment of claims and operating expenses and other holding company expenses, for at least the next 18 months. 
 We forecast claim payments based on our historical trends. We seek to manage the funding of claim payments by actively managing available cash and forecasting cash flows on a short- and long-term basis. Cash payments, net of reinsurance, for claims 
 48 

were 194.8 million in 2022, 189.6 million in 2021 and 179.9 million in 2020. We fund claim payments out of cash flow from operations, principally premiums, net of amounts ceded to our reinsurers, and net investment income. Our investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 950.5 million. 
 As discussed above under Overview, we purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Based on our estimates of future claims, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to satisfy the deductibles and retentions in our 2023 reinsurance program. We reevaluate our reinsurance program at least annually, taking into consideration a number of factors, including cost of reinsurance, our liquidity requirements, operating leverage and coverage terms. 
 Even if we maintain our existing retention levels, if the cost of reinsurance increases, our cash flow from operations would decrease as we would cede a greater portion of our written premiums to our reinsurers. Conversely, our cash flow from operations would increase if the cost of reinsurance declined relative to our retention. 
 We manage risk on certain long-duration claims by settling these claims through the purchase of annuities from unaffiliated life insurance companies. In the event these companies are unable to meet their obligations under these annuity contracts, we could be liable to the claimants, but our reinsurers remain obligated to indemnify us for all or part of these obligations in accordance with the terms of our reinsurance contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the present value of these annuities was 99.7 million, as estimated by our annuity providers. Substantially all of the annuities are issued or guaranteed by life insurance companies that have an A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent) or better. For additional information, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 The Company has operating and finance leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one month to 48 months, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years. The Company, in determining the present value of lease payments, utilizes either the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily determinable or the Company s incremental secured borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the underlying lease. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 28.2 million in 2022, as compared to 38.0 million in 2021, and 63.4 million in 2020. Major components of cash provided by operating activities in 2022 were net premiums collected of 278.9 million and investment income collected of 33.6 million. These amounts were offset in-part by claim payments of 206.3 million, 64.6 million of operating expenditures, federal taxes paid of 7.8 million, and dividends to policyholders paid of 3.4 million. 
 Major components of cash provided by operating activities in 2021 were net premiums collected of 290.2 million and investment income collected of 35.5 million. These amounts were offset in-part by claim payments of 189.6 million, 74.2 million of operating expenditures, federal taxes paid of 18.2 million, and dividends to policyholders paid of 3.9 million. 
 Major components of cash provided by operating activities in 2020 were net premiums collected of 294.4 million, investment income collected of 38.0 million, and a 7.9 million decrease in amounts held by others. These amounts were offset in-part by claim payments of 179.1 million, 69.4 million of operating expenditures, federal taxes paid of 20.6 million, and dividends to policyholders paid of 4.9 million. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 75.4 million in 2022, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 71.0 million in 2021 and net cash provided by investing activities of 43.4 million in 2020. In 2022, major components of net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 293.0 million, offset by investment purchases of 215.5 million. 
 In 2021, major components of net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 343.4 million, offset by investment purchases of 271.2 million. 
 In 2020, major components of net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of 365.2 million, offset by investment purchases of 320.9 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 112.9 million in 2022, as compared to 100.0 million in 2021 and 88.8 million in 2020. Major components of cash used in financing activities in 2022 included cash used for dividends paid to shareholders of 100.4 million and purchases of treasury stock of 12.4 million. 
 Major components of cash used in financing activities in 2021 and 2020 included cash used for dividends paid to shareholders of 99.9 million and 88.8 million, respectively.

In December 2022, the Company renewed a line of credit agreement with Frost Bank for borrowings up to a maximum of 20.0 million. Under the agreement, advances may be made either in the form of loans or letters of credit. Borrowings under the agreement accrue at interest rates based upon prime rate or one-month term SOFR rate and are unsecured. At December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings. Unless renewed, the agreement will expire in December 2023. 
 The Board of Directors initially authorized the Company s share repurchase program in February 2010. In October 2016, the Board reauthorized this program with a limit of 25.0 million with no expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, we had repurchased a total of 1,522,699 shares of our outstanding common stock for 34.8 million. The Company had 12.6 million available for future purchases at December 31, 2022 under this program. There were 264,449 shares repurchased in 2022. There were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020. The purchases may be effected from time to time depending upon market conditions and subject to applicable regulatory considerations. It is anticipated that future purchases will be funded from available capital. 
 AMERISAFE is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries, including AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX. AMERISAFE s primary assets are the capital stock of these insurance subsidiaries. The ability of AMERISAFE to fund its operations depends upon the surplus and earnings of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to AMERISAFE. Payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Based upon the prescribed calculation, the insurance subsidiaries could pay to AMERISAFE dividends of up to 56.0 million in 2023 without seeking regulatory approval. See Business Regulation Dividend Limitations in Item 1 of this report. 
 The Company paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.31, 0.29, 0.27 per share in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Company paid extraordinary cash dividends of 4.00 per share in both 2022 and 2021 and 3.50 per share in 2020. 
 On February 17, 2023, the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.34 per share payable on March 24, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2023. The Board intends to continue to consider the payment of a regular cash dividend each calendar quarter. On an annualized basis, the cash dividend is expected to be 1.36 per share in 2023. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 The principal objectives of our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and surplus and to maintain appropriate liquidity for corporate requirements. Additional objectives are to support our A.M. Best rating of A (Excellent) and to maximize after-tax income and total return. We presently expect to maintain sufficient liquidity from funds generated by operations to meet our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs. Excess funds from operations will be invested in accordance with our investment policy and statutory requirements. 
 We allocate our portfolio into four categories: cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities and equity securities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit, money market funds and municipal securities, corporate securities and certificates of deposit with a maturity date, at the time of purchase, of 90 days or less. Short-term investments include municipal securities, corporate securities and certificates of deposit with an original maturity greater than 90 days but less than one year. Our fixed maturity securities include obligations of the U.S. Treasury or U.S. agencies, obligations of states and their subdivisions, U.S. Dollar-denominated obligations of the U.S. or Canadian corporations, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. 
 Under Nebraska and Texas law, as applicable, each of AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX is required to invest only in securities that are either interest-bearing, interest-accruing or eligible for dividends, and must limit its investment in the securities of any single issuer, other than direct obligations of the United States, to five percent of the insurance company s assets. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these requirements. 
 We employ diversification policies and balance investment credit risk and related underwriting risks to minimize our total potential exposure to any one business sector or security. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, totaled 950.5 million, a decrease of 12.3 from December 31, 2021. The majority of our fixed maturity securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as defined by FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities. As such, the reported book value of those securities is equal to their amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and does not fluctuate based on changing interest rates. The remainder of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair market value, less an allowance for credit losses, if any. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair market value. 
 We follow FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when 
 50 

measuring fair value. As disclosed in Note 18 of the financial statements, our securities available-for-sale are classified using Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs. We did not elect the fair value option prescribed under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, for any financial assets in 2021 or 2022.

 Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. The major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our reinsurers. 
 51 

We address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by primarily investing in fixed maturity securities that are rated as investment grade by one or more of Moody s, Standard Poor s or Fitch. We also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities. To limit our risk exposure, we employ diversification policies that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector. 
 We are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Although our reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them, we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured. As a result, reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims and, in some cases, we might not be able to collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers. We address this credit risk by initially selecting reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of A- (Excellent) or better and by performing, along with our reinsurance broker, periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers. If one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade, we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment, including commutation, novation or letters of credit. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of this report. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had fixed maturity securities with a fair value of 789.3 million and a carrying value of 812.8 million. These securities are all subject to interest rate risk, but because we classify the majority of our fixed maturity securities as held-to-maturity, changes in interest rates have a smaller effect on the carrying value of our portfolio. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in a portfolio of securities with moderate effective duration. At December 31, 2022, the effective duration of the total investment portfolio, including cash and short term investments, was 4.2 years. 
 The table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2022 to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, and the associated impact on our shareholders equity. The change in carrying value is less than the change in fair value due to our held-to-maturity portfolio.

Equity Price Risk 
 Equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within net income. Accordingly, adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets, shareholders equity, and net income. In order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk, we independently monitor the financial condition of our equity securities and diversify our investments. In addition, we limit the percentage of equity securities held in our investment portfolio to the lesser of 10 of the investment portfolio or 30 of shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2022, the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of 62.1 million, representing 6.5 of our investment portfolio and less than 19.6 of shareholders equity on that date.

 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 AMERISAFE, Inc. and subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMERISAFE, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income , changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Valuation of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense reserves 

Description of the Matter 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) was 696 million, which includes Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) reserves of 119 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for loss and LAE represents the estimated ultimate costs of all reported and unreported losses incurred and unpaid as of the reporting date. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining the ultimate loss and LAE costs which are estimated using individual case-base valuations and statistical and actuarial analysis based upon experience for previously unreported claims and their ultimate loss and LAE costs. In particular, the estimates are sensitive to loss severity and frequency trends, changes in customers, products mix, claims management, regulatory factors, medical trends, employment and wage patterns, insurance policy coverage interpretations, and judicial determinations, among other factors. Auditing management s IBNR reserve estimate required the involvement of our actuarial specialists and was complex and highly judgmental due to the nature of significant assumptions used in the valuation process. The IBNR reserve estimate was sensitive to the selection of actuarial methods and assumptions, including the adjustment of historical loss severity experience for changes in products, policies, and customer base. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process for estimating loss and LAE reserves, including, among others controls over the review and approval processes that the Company has in place for the methods and assumptions used in estimating IBNR reserves. To test the recorded IBNR reserves, with the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the Company s selection of methods and assumptions, including loss severity, against those used in prior periods and used in the industry for similar types of insurance. We also considered changes to employment and wage patterns and the Company s customers, product mix, and claims management. We involved our actuarial specialist to independently calculate a range of reasonable loss and LAE reserve estimates and compared this range to the Company s recorded loss and LAE reserve. We also performed a review of the development of prior years reserve estimates.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 December 31, 2022 
 
 of comparable consolidated amounts of the Company for each of 2022, 2021 and 2020 . 
 
 thousand as of January 1, 2020, for the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2016-13. The transition adjustment includes a thousand impact to establish a credit loss allowance for held-to-maturity securities. The remaining thousand of the transition adjustment was due to the creation of the reinsurance recoverable credit allowance. The Company believes that under the standard there is no current expected credit allowance necessary for U.S. Government Securities in its judgment as: 1) Treasury securities typically are the most highly rated securities among rating agencies; 2) Treasury securities have a long history of no credit losses; 3) Treasury securities are guaranteed by a sovereign entity (the U.S. Government) that can print its own money and whose currency (the U.S. dollar) is the reserve currency. The Company believes that under the standard there is no current expected credit allowance necessary for GNMA Securities in its judgment as: 1) GNMA securities typically are the most highly rated securities among rating agencies; 2) GNMA securities have a long history of no credit losses and payments are explicitly guaranteed by the United States; 3) Underlying mortgage loans for GNMA securities are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs; 4) the U.S. Government can print its own money to retire GNMA obligations. The Company believes that under the standard there is no current expected credit allowance necessary for FNMA or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) Securities in its judgment as: 1) These securities typically are among the most highly rated securities among rating agencies; 2) There is a long history of no credit losses; 3) Principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the issuing agency; 4) There is an implicit guarantee by the U.S. Government that can print its own money and whose currency (the U.S. dollar) is the reserve currency. The Company researched various options and methodologies and has chosen to use Moody s default rates and recovery rates for our held-to-maturity fixed income securities based on the current credit rating of the security and the time period to the stated maturity date. This is a probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) methodology. The credit rating used for held-to-maturity fixed income securities is the rating for each security as published by Moody s, S P, and Fitch to determine the probability of default. If there are two ratings, the lower rating is used. If there are three ratings, the median rating is used. If there is one rating, that rating is used. This methodology provides additional conservatism in determining the credit loss allowance needed. For corporate fixed income securities, the probability of default (given a rating) comes from Moody s annual study of Corporate Bond defaults published each February. This study also contains the average recovery rates based on the historical defaults in the Moody s study. We have chosen to use the 1983-2021 data as more reflective of the current historical pattern of defaults (the study goes back to 1920). The maximum maturity using the default rate is years (any maturity greater than 20 years will use the 20-year rate). For municipal fixed income securities the probability of default (given a rating) comes from Moody s annual study of Municipal Bond defaults published each July/August. This study also contains the average recovery rates based on the historical defaults in the Moody s study. This study covers 1970-2021 data, which we believe is reflective of the current historical pattern of defaults. The maximum maturity using the default rate is years (any maturity greater than 20 years will use the 20-year rate). The Company did not record a credit allowance for available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale portfolio is composed of highly rated securities, which carry a low risk of default. The Company s concentrations in municipal bonds have helped lower default risk, as the historical default rates and recovery rates for municipal bonds has been much better than corporate bonds rated at the same level. The Company creates a watch list of available-for-sale securities that are below book value at the end of each quarter. This watch list excludes U.S. Treasury securities, GNMA Securities, and government agency securities (FNMA, etc.) as ne of those securities will have an expected credit loss. The watch list will also exclude those securities that are trading at least at or above (par value as the Company believes any slight difference between 95 and par likely reflect interest rate changes and liquidity only and are not a sign of credit impairment or market expectations for any current expected credit loss. The list is reviewed by the Management Investment Committee to evaluate any security where the discounted cash flows expected no longer exceed the book value of the security. If the Company intends to sell the security (or more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the loss) the Company will write down the security to fair value through earnings. If the Company intends to hold the security, the Company will establish a credit loss allowance for the security through earnings, and adjust the allowance each quarter through earnings, as the security changes in value. In determining the amount of the credit loss allowance, the Company considers all of the following factors: 1. The extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis 

 2. Adverse conditions in the security, industry, or geography, including: 

 a) Changes in technology 

 b) Discontinuation of a segment of business that may affect future earnings 

 c) Changes in the quality of the credit enhancement, if any 

 3. Changes in the payment structure of the debt security 

 4. Failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments 

 5. Any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 

 The calculation of the credit loss allowance will not take into account the amount of time the security has been below book value or when the security might be expected to recover in value. The Company has researched various options and methodologies and has chosen to use Moody s default rates and recovery rates for our unsecured reinsurance recoverables based on the current credit rating of the reinsurer and a time period of . This is a probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) methodology. The ten-year period is consistent with our current working layer reinsurance treaty where we have a treaty, which must be commuted by the end of the tenth year. We believe this is an appropriate approach to our reinsurance recoverables. The credit rating used for reinsurance recoverables uses the average rating for each reinsurer as published by Moody s, S P, Fitch and A.M. Best to determine the probability of default. The median rating is used if there are three ratings. The probability of default (given a rating) comes from Moody s annual study of Corporate Bond defaults published each February. This study also contains the average recovery rates based on the historical defaults in the Moody s study. We have chosen to use the 1983-2019 data as more reflective of the current historical pattern of defaults (the study goes back to 1920). The Company does t hold any debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized. Additionally, the Company does t hold any financial assets purchased with credit deterioration. The Company s internal working group evaluated the existing allowance for doubtful accounts reserving methodology for premiums receivable and determined the calculation was consistent with the new credit loss guidance. There was no impact to the premiums receivable balance as a result of the adoption of the new standard. The Company has elected not to establish a credit allowance for investment interest receivable. The Company plans to continue use of the current policy for writing off investment related interest receivable balances over old.

 years of underwriting workers compensation insurance. The actuarial analysis of our historical data provides the factors we use in estimating our loss reserves. These factors are primarily measures over time of the number of claims paid and reported, average paid and incurred claim amounts, claim closure rates and claim payment patterns. In evaluating the results of our analyses, management also uses substantial judgment in considering other factors that are not considered in these actuarial analyses, including changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, employment and wage patterns, insurance policy coverage interpretations, judicial determinations and other subjective factors. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may vary significantly from our original estimates. Although considerable variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes that the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are adequate. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any such adjustments are included in income from current operations. Subrogation recoverables, as well as deductible recoverables from policyholders, are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and aggregate estimates. Deductibles that are recoverable from policyholders and other recoverables from state funds decrease the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses. The Company funds its obligations under certain settled claims where the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis through the purchase of annuities. These annuities are purchased from unaffiliated carriers and name the claimant as payee. The cost of purchasing the annuity is recorded as paid loss and loss adjustment expenses. To the extent the annuity funds estimated future claims, reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense are reduced.

Balance at December 31, 2022 

The Company has established an allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities totaling million as of December 31, 2022. The majority of those securities were issued by states and political subdivisions and corporate bonds at and , respectively. The Company has allowance for credit losses on investments classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2022. The credit rating used for held-to-maturity fixed income securities is the rating for each security as published by Moody s, S P, and Fitch to determine the probability of default. If there are two ratings, the lower rating is used. If there are three ratings, the median rating is used. If there is one rating, that rating is used. For corporate fixed income securities (given a rating), the probability of default comes from Moody s annual study of corporate bond defaults published each February. The maximum maturity using the default rate is years (any maturity greater than years will use the 20-year rate). For municipal fixed income securities (given a rating), the probability of default comes from Moody s annual study of municipal bond defaults published each July/August. The calculation of the credit loss allowance takes the amortized cost of the fixed income security and assumes default and recovery based on the average recovery rates from the Moody s default studies. The amortized cost of the security plus any accrued interest, minus the amount recovered, is the estimated full amount the Company could lose in a default scenario. Then this amount is multiplied by the probability of default to determine the allowance for credit loss. The lower the security is rated, the higher likelihood of default, and therefore a higher allowance for credit loss. The longer to the maturity date of a security, the higher the default risk.

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers consists of ceded case reserves, ceded incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, and paid losses recoverable. Ceded case and ceded IBNR reserves represent the portion of gross loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities that are recoverable under reinsurance agreements, but are not yet due from reinsurers. Paid losses recoverable are receivables currently due from reinsurers for ceded paid losses. The Company considers paid losses recoverable outstanding for more than days to be past due. At December 31, 2022, there were no paid losses recoverable past due. The Company received reinsurance recoveries of million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including funds withheld accounts, irrevocable letters of credit and secured trusts. At December 31, 2022 , reinsurance recoverables from reinsurers that exceeded of statutory surplus of the Company s insurance subsidiaries are shown below.

The final resolution of the estimated loss reserve liability may be different from that anticipated at the reporting date because of the inherent uncertainty in loss reserve estimates, including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment. Consequently, actual paid losses in the future may result in a significantly different amount than currently reserved, favorable or unfavorable. The difference between currently estimated losses and losses estimated for a prior period at a prior valuation date is known as development. Development is unfavorable when the losses ultimately settle for more than they were reserved for or future estimates suggest that reserves should be increased on unresolved claims. Development is favorable when the losses ultimately settle for less than they were reserved for or future estimates suggest that reserves should be decreased on unresolved claims. Favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves are reflected in our results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. The foregoing reconciliation reflects favorable development of the net reserves at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The favorable development reduced loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by million in 2022, driven primarily by accident years 2017 through 2020. In 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded favorable development of million and million, respectively. The revisions to the Company s reserves reflect new information gained by claims adjusters in the normal course of adjusting claims and is reflected in the financial statements when the information becomes available. It is typical for more serious claims to take several years or longer to settle and the Company continually revises estimates as more information about claimants medical conditions and potential disability becomes known and the claims get closer to being settled. Multiple factors can cause loss development both unfavorable and favorable. The favorable loss development we experienced across accident years was largely due to favorable case reserve development from closed claims and claims where the worker had reached maximum medical improvement. Reserves established for workers compensation insurance includes the exposure to occupational disease or accidents related to asbestos or environmental claims. The exposure to asbestos claims emanates from the direct sale of workers compensation insurance. These claims resulted from industry workers who were exposed to tremolite asbestos dust and electricians and carpenters who were exposed to products that contained asbestos. There has been no known exposure to asbestos claims arising from assumed business. The emergence of these claims is slow and highly unpredictable. The Company estimates full impact of the asbestos exposure by establishing full case basis reserves on all known losses. Reserves for losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) include a provision for development of reserves on reported losses. Reserves are established for loss adjustment expenses (LAE) associated with these case and IBNR loss reserves.

The Company has historically written general liability coverages that are reported in other liability lines of business. These coverages may be associated with the property and casualty industry s exposure to environmental claims. However, the Company has not been notified by any insured for which exposure exists due to these types of claims. Company management believes potential exposure to environmental claims to be remote. Therefore, the Company has no loss or loss adjustment expense reserves for such liabilities. 

 years of underwriting workers compensation insurance. The actuarial analysis of our historical data provides some of the factors we use in estimating our loss reserves. These factors are primarily measures over time of the number of claims paid and reported, average paid and incurred claim amounts, claim closure rates and claim payment patterns. In evaluating the results of our analyses, management also uses substantial judgment in considering other factors that are not considered in these actuarial analyses, including changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, employment and wage patterns, insurance policy coverage interpretations, judicial determinations and other subjective factors. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may vary significantly from our original estimates. These anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

Property and casualty insurance companies are subject to certain risk-based capital requirements (RBC) specified by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Under these requirements, a target minimum amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property/casualty insurance company is determined based on the various risk factors related to it. At December 31, 2022, the capital and surplus of AIIC and its subsidiaries exceeded the minimum RBC requirements. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, AIIC cannot pay dividends to the Company in excess of the greater of of statutory surplus, or statutory net income, excluding realized investment gains, for the preceding 12-month period, without the prior approval of the Nebraska Director of Insurance. However, for purposes of this dividend calculation, net income from the previous two calendar years may be carried forward to the extent that it has not already been paid out as dividends. AIIC paid million in dividends to the Company in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. Based upon the dividend limitation described above, AIIC could pay to the Company dividends of up to million in 2023 without seeking regulatory approval.

The Company recognized compensation expense of in 2022 related to share-based grants under the 2022 Incentive Plan. Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan The AMERISAFE Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan (the Restricted Stock Plan) is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board and provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock awards to non-employee directors of the Company. Awards to non-employee directors are generally subject to terms including non-transferability, immediate vesting upon death or total disability of a director, forfeiture of unvested shares upon termination of service by a director and acceleration of vesting upon a change of control of the Company. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards under the Restricted Stock Plan is shares, subject to the authority of the Board to adjust this amount in the event of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or similar transaction affecting the common stock. At December 31, 2022, there were shares of common stock available for future awards under the Restricted Stock Plan. Under the Restricted Stock Plan, each non-employee director is automatically granted a restricted stock award for a number of shares equal to divided by the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders at which the non-employee director is elected or is continuing as a member of the Board. Each restricted stock award vests on the date of the next annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant, subject to the continued service of the non-employee director. As of December 31, 2022, there were shares of restricted stock outstanding under the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan, all of which will vest on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders in 2023.

The Company carries available-for-sale securities and equity securities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements and determines fair value measurements and disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard defines fair value, describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined in ASC Topic 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability and, therefore, represents an exit price, not an entry price. Fair value is the exit price in the principal market (or, if lacking a principal market, the most advantageous market) in which the reporting entity would transact. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and, as such, is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The exit price objective of a fair value measurement applies regardless of the reporting entity s intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present value amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, also known as current replacement cost. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are to be consistently applied. In ASC Topic 820, inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value (such as a pricing model) and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable: Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. 

 Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

 Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are intended to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 

 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are to be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

 In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. The fair values of the Company s investments are based upon prices provided by an independent pricing service. The Company has reviewed these prices for reasonableness and has not adjusted any prices received from the independent provider. Securities reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs represent assets whose fair value is determined based upon observable unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 securities represent assets whose fair value is determined using observable market information such as previous day trade prices, quotes from less active markets or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Item 9.	Changes in and Disagreements with Accou ntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 
 None. 
 Item 9A.	Control s and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms specified by the SEC. We note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving the stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on management s assessment under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, as stated in their report included herein. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Controls 
 Because of its inherent limitations, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any within the Company, have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 AMERISAFE, Inc. and subsidiaries 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited AMERISAFE, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AMERISAFE, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes or other amounts in connection with any payment made to or benefit realized by the Grantee under this Agreement, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that the Grantee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes or other amounts required to be withheld.

 	7.	 Compliance with Law . The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws; provided , however , that notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan and this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement if the issuance thereof would result in a violation of any such law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement prevents the Grantee from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations, and for purpose of clarity the Grantee is not prohibited from providing information voluntarily to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 21F of the Exchange Act. 
 	8.	 Compliance with Section 409A of the Code . To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement and the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.

 	11.	 Notices . All notices, requests, consents and other communications required or provided under this Agreement to be delivered by the Grantee to the Company will be in writing and will be deemed sufficient if delivered by hand, nationally recognized overnight courier, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and will be effective upon delivery to the Company at the address set forth below:

In its discretion (including the discretion provided to the Committee pursuant to the proviso included in Section 1 hereof), the Committee may require repayment to the Company (or forfeiture, as applicable) of all or any portion of the Long-Term Incentive Award (a) (i) if the amount paid was calculated based upon the achievement of performance objectives (as described in the Statement of Performance Goal) that were subsequently affected as a result of a restatement of the Company s statutory financial statements and (ii) the amount payable to the Grantee would have been lower than the amount actually paid to the Grantee, (b) in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (c) if the Grantee engages in Detrimental Activity.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Grantee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and the award described herein are subject to the terms and conditions of the Company s clawback policy (if any) as may be in effect from time to time, including specifically to implement Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (including applicable rules and regulations of any national securities exchange on which the Common Shares may be traded). 
 	13.	 Severability . In the event that one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated will be deemed to be separable from the other provisions of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and fully enforceable. 
 	14.	 No Right to Future Awards or Employment . The grant of the Long-Term Incentive Award under this Agreement to the Grantee is a voluntary, discretionary award being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards. No provision of this Agreement will limit in any way whatsoever any right that the Company or a Subsidiary may otherwise have to terminate the employment of the Grantee at any time. 
 	15.	 Relation to Other Benefits . Any economic or other benefit to the Grantee under this Agreement or the Plan will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan 
 	- 5 -	 
 
 NAI-1534978711v2 

maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary and will not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or a Subsidiary. 
 	16.	 Interpretation . The interpretation and construction of this Agreement by the Committee shall be final and conclusive. No member of the Committee shall be liable for any such action or determination made in good faith. 
 	17.	 Integration . The Long-Term Incentive Award is granted pursuant to the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. As such, this Agreement and the Plan embody the entire agreement and understanding of the Company and the Grantee and supersede any prior understandings or agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the Long-Term Incentive Award. 
 	18.	 Electronic Delivery . The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Long-Term Incentive Award and the Grantee s participation in the Plan, or future awards that may be granted under the Plan, by electronic means or request the Grantee s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Grantee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company. 
 	19.	 Acknowledgements . The Grantee acknowledges that the Grantee (a) has received a copy of the Plan, (b) has had an opportunity to review the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, (c) understands the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan and (d) agrees to such terms and conditions.

The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. 
 C.	Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company. 
 D.	It is further agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law or except 1) where this Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or 2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payee under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 
 article XXXvii 
 Arbitration 
 A.	As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any irreconcilable dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Contract, including the formation or validity thereof, whether arising before or after the expiry or termination of the Contract, shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three arbitrators. Notice requesting arbitration will be in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such reputable courier service as is capable of returning proof of receipt of such notice by the recipient to the party demanding arbitration.

 	 35 	 

B.	The Company shall have the option to either litigate or arbitrate where: 
 1.	The Reinsurer makes any allegation of misrepresentation, non-disclosure, concealment, fraud or bad faith; or 
 2.	The Reinsurer experiences any of the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs 1 through 8, 10, and 11 of paragraph A of the SPECIAL TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES ARTICLE. 
 C.	One arbitrator shall be appointed by each party. If either party fails to appoint its arbitrator within 30 days after being requested to do so by the other party, the latter, after 10 days notice by certified mail or reputable courier as provided above of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. 
 D.	The two arbitrators shall, before instituting the hearing, appoint an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Should the two arbitrators fail to choose the third arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the third arbitrator pursuant to the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS) Umpire Selection Procedure. All arbitrators shall be disinterested active or former senior executives of insurance or reinsurance companies or Underwriters at Lloyd s, London. 
 E.	Within 30 days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules for hearings. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. Unless the panel agrees otherwise, arbitration shall take place in Omaha, Nebraska but the venue may be changed when deemed by the panel to be in the best interest of the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of Nebraska. The decision of any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 
 F.	In the event an arbitrator is unable to serve due to death, disability or other incapacity, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article for the original selection of the arbitrator appointed and the newly constituted panel shall take all necessary and/or reasonable measures to continue the arbitration proceedings without additional delay. 
 G.	This Contract shall be interpreted as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation. The panel shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible following the termination of the hearings. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
 H.	Arbitration proceedings are subject to consolidation as follows: 
 
 American Interstate Insurance Company 
 Form of Casualty Excess of Loss Contract (Eff: 1-1-23) 
 	 36 	 

1.	Single contract, multiple reinsurers, common issue: If more than one Reinsurer is involved in arbitration where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers, at the Company s request, shall be joined in a single arbitration proceeding and shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. 
 2.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts, common issue: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company, under which a dispute has arisen where there are common questions of law or fact with the dispute being arbitrated under this Contract and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, the Reinsurer, at the Company s request, shall arbitrate all such reinsurance disputes involving the same loss or common questions of law or fact in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 3.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company and various disputes have arisen under such contracts, regardless of whether or not there are common questions of law or fact, if mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, the parties shall arbitrate all reinsurance disputes in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 	The agreement to consolidate disputes under this Contract and one or more other reinsurance contracts will supersede all other reinsurance contracts entered into between the Company and the Reinsurer, regardless of whether any other reinsurance contract may require or address consolidation. 
 I.	Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the cost of the third arbitrator. The remaining costs of the arbitration shall be allocated by the panel. The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs and expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorneys fees, to the extent permitted by law. However, the panel may not award any exemplary or punitive damages and enhanced compensatory damages. 
 article XXXVIii 
 expedited Arbitration 
 A.	Notwithstanding the provisions of the ARBITRATION ARTICLE, in the event an amount in dispute hereunder is 500,000 or less, the Company may elect to require an expedited arbitration process with the use of a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will be chosen in accordance with the procedures for selecting an arbitrator in force on the date the

 Form of Casualty Excess of Loss Contract (Eff: 1-1-23) 
 	 37 	 

arbitration is demanded, established by the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS). 
 B.	Each party s case will be submitted to the arbitrator within 100 days of the date of determination of the arbitrator. Discovery will be limited to exchanging only those documents directly relating to the issue in dispute, subject to a limit of two discovery depositions from each party, unless otherwise authorized by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. 
 C.	Within 120 days of the date of determination of the arbitrator, the hearing will be completed and a written award will be issued by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have all the powers conferred on the arbitration panel as provided in the ARBITRATION ARTICLE, and said Article will apply to all matters not specifically addressed above.

Failure or delay of the Reinsurer to provide such notice shall not constitute a waiver of the Company s rights or remedies contained herein or under law or equity, nor prevent the Company from asserting its rights hereunder at any time.

 3.	The Company may require the Reinsurer to fund its share of ceded unearned premium, outstanding loss and Loss Adjustment Expense reserves, reserves for losses and Loss Adjustment Expense incurred but not reported to the Company (IBNR as determined by the Company) and any other balances or financial obligations.

 1.	If payment of any claim has been received from the Reinsurers constituting at least 70.0 of the interests and liabilities of all the Reinsurers that participated on this Contract and are active as of the due date, it being understood that said date shall not be later than 90 days from the date of transmittal by the intermediary of the initial billing for each such payment, the Run-off Reinsurer shall be estopped from denying such claim and must pay within 10 days following transmittal to the Run-off Reinsurer of written notification of such payments. For purposes of this subparagraph, a Reinsurer shall be deemed to be active if it is not a Run-off Reinsurer. 
 2.	The interest penalty specified in the Late Payments Article shall be increased by 0.5 for each 30 days that the payment is past due.

 1.	The Company will be denied statutory credit for reinsurance ceded to that Reinsurer pursuant to the credit for reinsurance law or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction; or 
 2.	The Company is allowed statutory credit for reinsurance ceded to that Reinsurer on the basis of that Reinsurer having satisfied the conditions pertaining to Reciprocal Jurisdictions as set forth in the credit for reinsurance law or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, and:

The Reinsurer hereby agrees to fund such 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 21 	 

reserves in the amount necessary for the Company to obtain full credit for reinsurance pursuant to the credit for reinsurance law or regulations of the regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company s reserves and in respect of known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Reinsurer and allocated Loss Adjustment Expense relating thereto, losses and allocated Loss Adjustment Expense paid by the Company but not recovered from the Reinsurer, plus reserves for losses incurred but not reported, as shown in the statement prepared by the Company (hereinafter referred to as Reinsurer s obligations by funds withheld, cash advances or a Letter of Credit.

 C.	When funding by a Letter of Credit, the Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely delivery to the Company of a clean, irrevocable and unconditional Letter of Credit issued by a bank and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company s reserves in an amount equal to the Reinsurer s proportion of said reserves. Such Letter of Credit shall be issued for a period of not less than one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from its date of expiration or any future expiration date unless 30 days (60 days where required by insurance regulatory authorities) prior to any expiration date the issuing bank shall notify the Company by certified or registered mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letter of Credit extended for any additional period. 
 D.	The Reinsurer and Company agree that the Letters of Credit provided by the Reinsurer pursuant to the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any time, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or any successor, by operation of law, of the Company including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Company for the following purposes, unless otherwise provided for in a separate Trust Agreement: 
 1.	To reimburse the Company for the Reinsurer s obligations, the payment of which is due under the terms of this Contract and which has not been otherwise paid; 
 2.	To make refund of any sum which is in excess of the actual amount required to pay the Reinsurer s obligations under this Contract; 
 3.	To fund an account with the Company for the Reinsurer s obligations. Such cash deposit shall be held in an interest bearing account separate from the Company s other assets, and interest thereon not in excess of the prime rate shall accrue to the benefit of the Reinsurer; 
 4.	To pay the Reinsurer s share of any other amounts the Company claims are due under this Contract.

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 22 	 

excess amount so drawn. All of the foregoing shall be applied without diminution because of insolvency on the part of the Company or the Reinsurer. 
 E.	The issuing bank shall have no responsibility whatsoever in connection with the propriety of withdrawals made by the Company or the disposition of funds withdrawn, except to ensure that withdrawals are made only upon the order of properly authorized representatives of the Company. 
 F.	At annual intervals, or more frequently as agreed but never more frequently than quarterly, the Company shall prepare a specific statement of the Reinsurer s obligations, for the sole purpose of amending the Letter of Credit, in the following manner: 
 1.	If the statement shows that the Reinsurer s obligations exceed the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Reinsurer shall, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Company of an amendment to the Letter of Credit increasing the amount of credit by the amount of such difference. 
 2.	If, however, the statement shows that the Reinsurer s obligations are less than the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Company shall, within 30 days after receipt of written request from the Reinsurer, release such excess credit by agreeing to secure an amendment to the Letter of Credit reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of such excess credit. 
 G.	Should the Reinsurer be in breach of its obligations under this Article, notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Contract, the Company may seek relief in respect of said breach from any court having competent jurisdiction of the parties hereto.

This Contract applies only to that portion of any Policy which the Company retains net for its own account (prior to deduction of any underlying reinsurance specifically permitted in this Contract), and in calculating the amount of any loss hereunder and also in computing the amount or amounts in excess of which this Contract attaches, only loss or losses in respect of that portion of any Policy which the Company retains net for its own account shall be included. 
 B.	The amount of the Reinsurer s liability hereunder in respect of any loss or losses shall not be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to collect from any other reinsurer(s), whether specific or general, any amounts which may have become due from such reinsurer(s), whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurer(s) or otherwise.

The Reinsurer hereby acknowledges that the documents, information, and data provided to the Reinsurer by the Company, whether directly or through an authorized agent, in connection with the placement, execution or renewal of this Contract, and arising out of this Contract, Confidential Information are proprietary and confidential to the Company. Confidential Information includes but is not limited to Nonpublic Information as that term is defined by the Insurance Data Security Model Law, approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (hereinafter Model Law ). 
 B.	Absent the prior written consent of the Company, the Reinsurer will not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties, except when: 
 1.	The disclosure is to professional advisors or to authorized agents of the Reinsurer performing underwriting, claim handling, pricing, placement and/or evaluation services for the Reinsurer; or 
 2.	The Confidential Information is publicly known or has become publicly known through no unauthorized act of the Reinsurer; or 
 3.	Required by retrocessionaires subject to the business ceded to this Contract; or 
 4.	Required by state regulators performing an audit of the Reinsurer s records and/or financial condition; or 
 5.	Required by auditors performing an audit of the Reinsurer s records in the normal course of business. 
 C.	Further, the Reinsurer agrees not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose not permitted by this Contract or not related to the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights under this Contract. 
 D.	Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Reinsurer is required by court order, other legal process, or any regulatory authority to release or disclose any or all of the Confidential Information, the Reinsurer agrees to provide the Company by written or electronic mail, reasonable advance notice of same prior to such release or disclosure and to use their reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this Article.

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 25 	 

Confidential Information in accordance with this Contract and will be binding upon the Reinsurer s and its affiliates successors and assigns.

 article XXXIIi 
 SUNSET AND COMMUTATION 
 A.	Ten (10) years after the expiration of this Contract (including the runoff period, if any), the Company shall advise the Reinsurer of any Loss Occurrences attaching to this Contract which have not been finally settled and which may result in a claim by the Company under this Contract. No liability shall attach hereunder for any claim or claims not reported to the Reinsurer within this ten (10) year period (plus the runoff period, if any). If a loss arising out of a Loss Occurrence is reported during this period, all losses arising out of the same Loss Occurrence shall be deemed reported under this paragraph regardless of when notification of loss is provided. 
 B.	If both parties agree to commute the unsettled losses subject to the Contract, then the Reinsurer s liability for all such unsettled losses shall then be commuted. 
 C.	It is understood that commutation of all such losses shall be made using tabular reserving methods. For each loss, the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss shall be established by projecting out future medical and indemnity payments and loss expenses by year based on appropriate trends and escalations applied to annual cost estimates. The Contract limit and retention (where applicable) shall then be applied to the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss to determine the nominal ultimate Contract loss. Mortality factors and discount factors shall then be applied by year to the nominal ultimate Contract loss. The discounted, mortality adjusted projected annual loss payments shall be summed to determine the present value commutation price of the ultimate Contract loss. The medical escalation, discount and mortality factors are described in paragraph D. 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 26 	 

D.	The following factors shall be utilized in establishing the commutation price: 
 1.	Medical Escalation Rate 
 	The medical escalation rate shall be a reasonable estimate of future medical inflation. 
 2.	Discount Rate 
 	The discount rate shall be the annualized 10-year U.S. Treasury Bill rate at the Valuation Date. 
 3.	Mortality Tables 
 	Mortality factors shall be based on the most recent mortality table at the Valuation Date from the Vital Statistics of the United States as published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Factors for extension beyond age 85 shall also be included. 
 4.	Impairment 
 	Impairment factors shall be based on the individual claim characteristics. 
 	Any other method of calculating the commutation price of one or more losses subject to this Contract may be used as mutually agreed between the Company and the Reinsurer. 
 E.	If the Company and the Reinsurer cannot agree on a commutation value, the effort can be abandoned. Alternatively, the Company and the Reinsurer may mutually agree to settle any difference using a panel of three actuaries, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an actuary within 30 days, the other party may appoint two actuaries. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the selection of a third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall name two, of whom the other shall decline one and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. All the actuaries shall be regularly engaged in the valuation of Workers Compensation claims and shall be Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society or members of the American Academy of Actuaries. All of the actuaries shall be independent of either party to this Contract. 
 F.	The settlement agreed upon by a majority of the panel of actuaries shall be final and binding on both parties and set forth in a sworn written document expressing their professional opinion that said value is fair for the complete mutual release of all liabilities in respect of such reserves. 
 G.	The Reinsurer s commutation payment shall be due within seven days following the date the Company and the Reinsurer agree to the commutation price. Such payment by the Reinsurer shall constitute both a complete release of the Reinsurer of its liability for all 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 27 	 

losses, known or unknown, under this Contract, and a complete release of the Company of its liabilities and obligations, known or unknown, under this Contract. 
 H.	This Article shall survive the expiration of this Contract. 
 article XXXiv 
 INSOLVENCY 
 A.	If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of Company in the PREAMBLE of this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company covered hereunder. In the event a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company covered hereunder, that domiciliary state s laws shall prevail. 
 B.	In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of the liability of the Company, or on the basis of claims filed and allowed in the liquidation proceedings, whichever may be required by applicable statute, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the Policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. 
 C.	Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company. 
 D.	It is further agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except 1) where this Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or 2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 28 	 

to the payee under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 
 E.	In the event of the insolvency of any company or companies listed in the designation of Company under this Contract, this Article shall apply only to the insolvent company or companies. 
 article XXXV 
 Arbitration 
 A.	As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any irreconcilable dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Contract, including the formation or validity thereof, whether arising before or after the expiry or termination of the Contract, shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three arbitrators. Notice requesting arbitration will be in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such reputable courier service as is capable of returning proof of receipt of such notice by the recipient to the party demanding arbitration. 
 B.	The Company shall have the option to either litigate or arbitrate where: 
 1.	The Reinsurer makes any allegation of misrepresentation, non-disclosure, concealment, fraud or bad faith; or 
 2.	The Reinsurer experiences any of the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs 1 through 10 of paragraph A of the SPECIAL TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES ARTICLE. 
 C.	One arbitrator shall be appointed by each party. If either party fails to appoint its arbitrator within 30 days after being requested to do so by the other party, the latter, after 10 days notice by certified mail or reputable courier as provided above of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. 
 D.	The two arbitrators shall, before instituting the hearing, appoint an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Should the two arbitrators fail to choose the third arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the third arbitrator pursuant to the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS) Umpire Selection Procedure. All arbitrators shall be disinterested active or former senior executives of insurance or reinsurance companies or Underwriters at Lloyd s, London. 
 E.	Within 30 days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules for hearings. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. Unless the panel agrees otherwise, arbitration shall take place in Omaha, Nebraska but the venue may be changed when deemed by the panel to be in the best interest of the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17900N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Per Occurrence XOL	Page 29 	 

substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of Nebraska. The decision of any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 
 F.	In the event an arbitrator is unable to serve due to death, disability or other incapacity, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article for the original selection of the arbitrator appointed and the newly constituted panel shall take all necessary and/or reasonable measures to continue the arbitration proceedings without additional delay. 
 G.	This Contract shall be interpreted as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation. The panel shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible following the termination of the hearings. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
 H.	Arbitration proceedings are subject to consolidation as follows: 
 1.	Single contract, multiple reinsurers, common issue: If more than one Reinsurer is involved in arbitration where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers, at the Company s request, shall be joined in a single arbitration proceeding and shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. 
 2.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts, common issue: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company, under which a dispute has arisen where there are common questions of law or fact with the dispute being arbitrated under this Contract and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, the Reinsurer, at the Company s request, shall arbitrate all such reinsurance disputes involving the same loss or common questions of law or fact in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article.

reserves in the amount necessary for the Company to obtain full credit for reinsurance pursuant to the credit for reinsurance law or regulations of the regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company s reserves and in respect of known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Reinsurer and allocated Loss Adjustment Expense relating thereto, losses and allocated Loss Adjustment Expense paid by the Company but not recovered from the Reinsurer, plus reserves for losses incurred but not reported, as shown in the statement prepared by the Company (hereinafter referred to as Reinsurer s obligations by funds withheld, cash advances or a Letter of Credit.

 C.	When funding by a Letter of Credit, the Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely delivery to the Company of a clean, irrevocable and unconditional Letter of Credit issued by a bank and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company s reserves in an amount equal to the Reinsurer s proportion of said reserves. Such Letter of Credit shall be issued for a period of not less than one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from its date of expiration or any future expiration date unless 30 days (60 days where required by insurance regulatory authorities) prior to any expiration date the issuing bank shall notify the Company by certified or registered mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letter of Credit extended for any additional period. 
 D.	The Reinsurer and Company agree that the Letters of Credit provided by the Reinsurer pursuant to the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any time, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or any successor, by operation of law, of the Company including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Company for the following purposes, unless otherwise provided for in a separate Trust Agreement:

American Interstate Insurance Company

 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 21 	 

excess amount so drawn. All of the foregoing shall be applied without diminution because of insolvency on the part of the Company or the Reinsurer. 
 E.	The issuing bank shall have no responsibility whatsoever in connection with the propriety of withdrawals made by the Company or the disposition of funds withdrawn, except to ensure that withdrawals are made only upon the order of properly authorized representatives of the Company. 
 F.	At annual intervals, or more frequently as agreed but never more frequently than quarterly, the Company shall prepare a specific statement of the Reinsurer s obligations, for the sole purpose of amending the Letter of Credit, in the following manner: 
 1.	If the statement shows that the Reinsurer s obligations exceed the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Reinsurer shall, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Company of an amendment to the Letter of Credit increasing the amount of credit by the amount of such difference. 
 2.	If, however, the statement shows that the Reinsurer s obligations are less than the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Company shall, within 30 days after receipt of written request from the Reinsurer, release such excess credit by agreeing to secure an amendment to the Letter of Credit reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of such excess credit. 
 G.	Should the Reinsurer be in breach of its obligations under this Article, notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Contract, the Company may seek relief in respect of said breach from any court having competent jurisdiction of the parties hereto.

 ArTICLE XXXI

 A.	The Reinsurer hereby acknowledges that the documents, information, and data provided to the Reinsurer by the Company, whether directly or through an authorized agent, in connection with the placement, execution or renewal of this Contract, and arising out of this Contract, Confidential Information are proprietary and confidential to the Company. Confidential Information includes but is not limited to Nonpublic Information as that term is defined by the Insurance Data Security Model Law, approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (hereinafter Model Law ). 
 B.	Absent the prior written consent of the Company, the Reinsurer will not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties, except when: 
 1.	The disclosure is to professional advisors or to authorized agents of the Reinsurer performing underwriting, claim handling, pricing, placement and/or evaluation services for the Reinsurer; or 
 2.	The Confidential Information is publicly known or has become publicly known through no unauthorized act of the Reinsurer; or 
 3.	Required by retrocessionaires subject to the business ceded to this Contract; or 
 4.	Required by state regulators performing an audit of the Reinsurer s records and/or financial condition; or 
 5.	Required by auditors performing an audit of the Reinsurer s records in the normal course of business. 
 C.	Further, the Reinsurer agrees not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose not permitted by this Contract or not related to the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights under this Contract. 
 D.	Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Reinsurer is required by court order, other legal process, or any regulatory authority to release or disclose any or all of the Confidential Information, the Reinsurer agrees to provide the Company by written or electronic mail, reasonable advance notice of same prior to such release or disclosure and to use their reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this Article.

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 24 	 

Confidential Information in accordance with this Contract and will be binding upon the Reinsurer s and its affiliates successors and assigns.

 G.	To protect Confidential Information, the Reinsurer must institute and maintain safeguards in accordance with or comparable to that required for both Licensees and Third Party Service Providers as provided in the Model Law. 
 article XXXII 
 SUNSET AND COMMUTATION 
 A.	Ten (10) years after the expiration of this Contract (including the runoff period, if any), the Company shall advise the Reinsurer of any Loss Occurrences attaching to this Contract which have not been finally settled and which may result in a claim by the Company under this Contract. No liability shall attach hereunder for any claim or claims not reported to the Reinsurer within this ten (10) year period (plus the runoff period, if any). If a loss arising out of a Loss Occurrence is reported during this period, all losses arising out of the same Loss Occurrence shall be deemed reported under this paragraph regardless of when notification of loss is provided. 
 B.	If both parties agree to commute the unsettled losses subject to the Contract, then the Reinsurer s liability for all such unsettled losses shall then be commuted. 
 C.	It is understood that commutation of all such losses shall be made using tabular reserving methods. For each loss, the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss shall be established by projecting out future medical and indemnity payments and loss expenses by year based on appropriate trends and escalations applied to annual cost estimates. The Contract limit and retention (where applicable) shall then be applied to the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss to determine the nominal ultimate Contract loss. Mortality factors and discount factors shall then be applied by year to the nominal ultimate Contract loss. The discounted, mortality adjusted projected annual loss payments shall be summed to determine the present value commutation price of the ultimate Contract loss. The medical escalation, discount and mortality factors are described in paragraph D. 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 25 	 

D.	The following factors shall be utilized in establishing the commutation price: 
 1.	Medical Escalation Rate 
 	The medical escalation rate shall be a reasonable estimate of future medical inflation. 
 2.	Discount Rate 
 	The discount rate shall be the annualized 10-year U.S. Treasury Bill rate at the Valuation Date. 
 3.	Mortality Tables 
 	Mortality factors shall be based on the most recent mortality table at the Valuation Date from the Vital Statistics of the United States as published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Factors for extension beyond age 85 shall also be included. 
 4.	Impairment 
 	Impairment factors shall be based on the individual claim characteristics. 
 	Any other method of calculating the commutation price of one or more losses subject to this Contract may be used as mutually agreed between the Company and the Reinsurer. 
 E.	If the Company and the Reinsurer cannot agree on a commutation value, the effort can be abandoned. Alternatively, the Company and the Reinsurer may mutually agree to settle any difference using a panel of three actuaries, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an actuary within 30 days, the other party may appoint two actuaries. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the selection of a third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall name two, of whom the other shall decline one and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. All the actuaries shall be regularly engaged in the valuation of Workers Compensation claims and shall be Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society or members of the American Academy of Actuaries. All of the actuaries shall be independent of either party to this Contract. 
 F.	The settlement agreed upon by a majority of the panel of actuaries shall be final and binding on both parties and set forth in a sworn written document expressing their professional opinion that said value is fair for the complete mutual release of all liabilities in respect of such reserves. 
 G.	The Reinsurer s commutation payment shall be due within seven days following the date the Company and the Reinsurer agree to the commutation price. Such payment by the Reinsurer shall constitute both a complete release of the Reinsurer of its liability for all 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 26 	 

losses, known or unknown, under this Contract, and a complete release of the Company of its liabilities and obligations, known or unknown, under this Contract. 
 H.	This Article shall survive the expiration of this Contract. 
 article XXXIII 
 INSOLVENCY 
 A.	If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of Company in the PREAMBLE of this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company covered hereunder. In the event a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company covered hereunder, that domiciliary state s laws shall prevail. 
 B.	In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of the liability of the Company, or on the basis of claims filed and allowed in the liquidation proceedings, whichever may be required by applicable statute, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the Policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. 
 C.	Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company. 
 D.	It is further agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except 1) where this Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or 2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 27 	 

to the payee under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 
 E.	In the event of the insolvency of any company or companies listed in the designation of Company under this Contract, this Article shall apply only to the insolvent company or companies. 
 article XXXIV 
 Arbitration 
 A.	As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any irreconcilable dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Contract, including the formation or validity thereof, whether arising before or after the expiry or termination of the Contract, shall be submitted for decision to a panel of three arbitrators. Notice requesting arbitration will be in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such reputable courier service as is capable of returning proof of receipt of such notice by the recipient to the party demanding arbitration. 
 B.	The Company shall have the option to either litigate or arbitrate where: 
 1.	The Reinsurer makes any allegation of misrepresentation, non-disclosure, concealment, fraud or bad faith; or 
 2.	The Reinsurer experiences any of the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs 1 through 10 of paragraph A of the SPECIAL TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES ARTICLE. 
 C.	One arbitrator shall be appointed by each party. If either party fails to appoint its arbitrator within 30 days after being requested to do so by the other party, the latter, after 10 days notice by certified mail or reputable courier as provided above of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. 
 D.	The two arbitrators shall, before instituting the hearing, appoint an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Should the two arbitrators fail to choose the third arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the third arbitrator pursuant to the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS) Umpire Selection Procedure. All arbitrators shall be disinterested active or former senior executives of insurance or reinsurance companies or Underwriters at Lloyd s, London. 
 E.	Within 30 days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules for hearings. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. Unless the panel agrees otherwise, arbitration shall take place in Omaha, Nebraska but the venue may be changed when deemed by the panel to be in the best interest of the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 28 	 

substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of Nebraska. The decision of any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 
 F.	In the event an arbitrator is unable to serve due to death, disability or other incapacity, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article for the original selection of the arbitrator appointed and the newly constituted panel shall take all necessary and/or reasonable measures to continue the arbitration proceedings without additional delay. 
 G.	This Contract shall be interpreted as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation. The panel shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible following the termination of the hearings. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
 H.	Arbitration proceedings are subject to consolidation as follows: 
 1.	Single contract, multiple reinsurers, common issue: If more than one Reinsurer is involved in arbitration where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers, at the Company s request, shall be joined in a single arbitration proceeding and shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. 
 2.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts, common issue: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company, under which a dispute has arisen where there are common questions of law or fact with the dispute being arbitrated under this Contract and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, the Reinsurer, at the Company s request, shall arbitrate all such reinsurance disputes involving the same loss or common questions of law or fact in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 3.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company and various disputes have arisen under such contracts, regardless of whether or not there are common questions of law or fact, if mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, the parties shall arbitrate all reinsurance disputes in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 	The agreement to consolidate disputes under this Contract and one or more other reinsurance contracts will supersede all other reinsurance contracts entered into between the Company and the Reinsurer, regardless of whether any other reinsurance contract may require or address consolidation. 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 17906N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 29 	 

I.	Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the cost of the third arbitrator. The remaining costs of the arbitration shall be allocated by the panel. The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs and expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorney s fees, to the extent permitted by law. However, the panel may not award any Exemplary or Punitive Damages and Enhanced Compensatory Damages. 
 article XXXV 
 expedited Arbitration 
 A.	Notwithstanding the provisions of the ARBITRATION ARTICLE, in the event an amount in dispute hereunder is 500,000 or less, the Company may elect to require an expedited arbitration process with the use of a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will be chosen in accordance with the procedures for selecting a single neutral arbitrator in force on the date the arbitration is demanded, established by the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS). 
 B.	Each party s case will be submitted to the arbitrator within 100 days of the date of determination of the arbitrator. Discovery will be limited to exchanging only those documents directly relating to the issue in dispute, subject to a limit of two discovery depositions from each party, unless otherwise authorized by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. 
 C.	Within 120 days of the date of determination of the arbitrator, the hearing will be completed and a written award will be issued by the arbitrator.

 SUNSET AND COMMUTATION 
 A.	Ten (10) years after the expiration of this Contract (including the runoff period, if any), the Company shall advise the Reinsurer of any Loss Occurrences attaching to this Contract which have not been finally settled and which may result in a claim by the Company under this Contract. No liability shall attach hereunder for any claim or claims not reported to the Reinsurer within this ten (10) year period (plus the runoff period, if any). If a loss arising 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 13214N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 25 	 

out of a Loss Occurrence is reported during this period, all losses arising out of the same Loss Occurrence shall be deemed reported under this paragraph regardless of when notification of loss is provided. 
 B.	If both parties agree to commute the unsettled losses subject to the Contract, then the Reinsurer s liability for all such unsettled losses shall then be commuted. 
 C.	It is understood that commutation of all such losses shall be made using tabular reserving methods. For each loss, the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss shall be established by projecting out future medical and indemnity payments and loss expenses by year based on appropriate trends and escalations applied to annual cost estimates. The Contract limit and retention (where applicable) shall then be applied to the nominal ultimate value of the Company s Ultimate Net Loss to determine the nominal ultimate Contract loss. Mortality factors and discount factors shall then be applied by year to the nominal ultimate Contract loss. The discounted, mortality adjusted projected annual loss payments shall be summed to determine the present value commutation price of the ultimate Contract loss. The medical escalation, discount and mortality factors are described in paragraph D. 
 D.	The following factors shall be utilized in establishing the commutation price: 
 1.	Medical Escalation Rate 
 	The medical escalation rate shall be a reasonable estimate of future medical inflation. 
 2.	Discount Rate 
 	The discount rate shall be the annualized 10-year U.S. Treasury Bill rate at the Valuation Date. 
 3.	Mortality Tables 
 	Mortality factors shall be based on the most recent mortality table at the Valuation Date from the Vital Statistics of the United States as published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Factors for extension beyond age 85 shall also be included. 
 4.	Impairment 
 	Impairment factors shall be based on the individual claim characteristics. 
 	Any other method of calculating the commutation price of one or more losses subject to this Contract may be used as mutually agreed between the Company and the Reinsurer. 
 E.	If the Company and the Reinsurer cannot agree on a commutation value, the effort can be abandoned. Alternatively, the Company and the Reinsurer may mutually agree to settle 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 13214N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 26 	 

any difference using a panel of three actuaries, one to be chosen by each party and the third by the two so chosen. If either party refuses or neglects to appoint an actuary within 30 days, the other party may appoint two actuaries. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the selection of a third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall name two, of whom the other shall decline one and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. All the actuaries shall be regularly engaged in the valuation of Workers Compensation claims and shall be Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society or members of the American Academy of Actuaries. All of the actuaries shall be independent of either party to this Contract. 
 F.	The settlement agreed upon by a majority of the panel of actuaries shall be final and binding on both parties and set forth in a sworn written document expressing their professional opinion that said value is fair for the complete mutual release of all liabilities in respect of such reserves. 
 G.	The Reinsurer s commutation payment shall be due within seven days following the date the Company and the Reinsurer agree to the commutation price. Such payment by the Reinsurer shall constitute both a complete release of the Reinsurer of its liability for all losses, known or unknown, under this Contract, and a complete release of the Company of its liabilities and obligations, known or unknown, under this Contract. 
 H.	This Article shall survive the expiration of this Contract. 
 article XXXIII 
 INSOLVENCY 
 A.	If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of Company in the PREAMBLE of this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company covered hereunder. In the event a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company covered hereunder, that domiciliary state s laws shall prevail. 
 B.	In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor, with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of the liability of the Company, or on the basis of claims filed and allowed in the liquidation proceedings, whichever may be required by applicable statute, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the Policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 13214N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 27 	 

claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer. 
 C.	Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company. 
 D.	It is further agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except 1) where this Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or 2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payee under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 
 E.	In the event of the insolvency of any company or companies listed in the designation of Company under this Contract, this Article shall apply only to the insolvent company or companies. 
 article XXXIV

 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 28 	 

notice by certified mail or reputable courier as provided above of its intention to do so, may appoint the second arbitrator. 
 D.	The two arbitrators shall, before instituting the hearing, appoint an impartial third arbitrator who shall preside at the hearing. Should the two arbitrators fail to choose the third arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the parties shall appoint the third arbitrator pursuant to the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society U.S. (ARIAS) Umpire Selection Procedure. All arbitrators shall be disinterested active or former senior executives of insurance or reinsurance companies or Underwriters at Lloyd s, London. 
 E.	Within 30 days after notice of appointment of all arbitrators, the panel shall meet and determine timely periods for briefs, discovery procedures and schedules for hearings. The panel shall be relieved of all judicial formality and shall not be bound by the strict rules of procedure and evidence. Unless the panel agrees otherwise, arbitration shall take place in Omaha, Nebraska but the venue may be changed when deemed by the panel to be in the best interest of the arbitration proceeding. Insofar as the arbitration panel looks to substantive law, it shall consider the law of the State of Nebraska. The decision of any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding. The panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate. 
 F.	In the event an arbitrator is unable to serve due to death, disability or other incapacity, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article for the original selection of the arbitrator appointed and the newly constituted panel shall take all necessary and/or reasonable measures to continue the arbitration proceedings without additional delay. 
 G.	This Contract shall be interpreted as an honorable engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation. The panel shall make its decision considering the custom and practice of the applicable insurance and reinsurance business as promptly as possible following the termination of the hearings. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
 H.	Arbitration proceedings are subject to consolidation as follows: 
 1.	Single contract, multiple reinsurers, common issue: If more than one Reinsurer is involved in arbitration where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers, at the Company s request, shall be joined in a single arbitration proceeding and shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one party; provided, however, that nothing therein shall impair the rights of such Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. 
 2.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts, common issue: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company, under which a 

American Interstate Insurance Company 
 13214N23 (Eff. 1-1-23) 
 Casualty Catastrophe XOL	Page 29 	 

dispute has arisen where there are common questions of law or fact with the dispute being arbitrated under this Contract and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, the Reinsurer, at the Company s request, shall arbitrate all such reinsurance disputes involving the same loss or common questions of law or fact in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 3.	Single reinsurer, multiple contracts: If any Reinsurer to this Contract has subscribed to other reinsurance contracts with the Company and various disputes have arisen under such contracts, regardless of whether or not there are common questions of law or fact, if mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, the parties shall arbitrate all reinsurance disputes in one consolidated proceeding, subject to the provisions of this Article. 
 	The agreement to consolidate disputes under this Contract and one or more other reinsurance contracts will supersede all other reinsurance contracts entered into between the Company and the Reinsurer, regardless of whether any other reinsurance contract may require or address consolidation. 
 I.	Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the cost of the third arbitrator. The remaining costs of the arbitration shall be allocated by the panel. The panel may, at its discretion, award such further costs and expenses as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorney s fees, to the extent permitted by law. However, the panel may not award any Exemplary or Punitive Damages and Enhanced Compensatory Damages. 
 article XXXV

 B.	Each party s case will be submitted to the arbitrator within 100 days of the date of determination of the arbitrator.
