 Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 We were formed as a Maryland corporation on June 28, 2013 to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC s investment platform. 
 We underwrite our investments seeking an unlevered yield-to-maturity on our growth capital loans and equipment financings generally ranging from 10 to 18 and on our revolving loans generally ranging from 1 above the applicable prime rate to 10 , in each case, with potential for higher returns in the event we are able to exercise warrant investments and realize gains or sell our related equity investments at a profit. We also generally underwrite our secured loans seeking a loan-to-enterprise value of less than 25 . 
 We make investments that our Adviser s senior investment team believes have a low probability of loss due to their expertise and the revenue profile, product validation, customer commitments, intellectual property, financial condition and enterprise value of the potential opportunity. We believe these investments provide us with a stable, fixed-income revenue stream along with the potential for equity-related gains on a risk-adjusted basis. We believe that the venture growth stage debt market presents a compelling growth channel for us because it has high barriers to entry and is underserved by both traditional lenders and existing debt financing providers to venture capital-backed companies given the brand, reputation and market acceptance, industry relationships, venture lending and leasing expertise, specialized skills, track record, and other factors required to lend to companies backed by leading venture capital investors. Additionally, we believe our investments are distinct compared with the investments made by more traditional lenders because our investments provide us the ability to invest alongside leading venture capital investors in companies focused in technology and other high growth industries. We also believe that our investments are distinct compared to the investments made by existing debt financing providers to venture capital backed companies given our primary focus on venture growth stage companies backed by TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors. 
 We believe we are able to successfully structure these investments as a result of the strong value proposition our secured loans offer to both borrowers and their venture capital investors. Our secured loans provide venture growth stage companies with an opportunity to: 
 diversify their funding sources; 
 augment their existing capital base and extend operating capital; 
 scale business operations and accelerate growth; 
 fund expenses ahead of anticipated corresponding revenue; 
 expand product offerings through internal development or acquisitions; 
 1 

lower the upfront costs of capital expenditures; 
 build and/or expand their leadership positions within their respective markets; 
 accelerate and/or reduce volatility in the timing of cash collections; and 
 delay and/or postpone the need for their next round of equity financing, in each case, extending their cash available to fund operations without incurring substantial equity dilution during a critical time in their lifecycle when they are meaningfully building enterprise value. 
 TriplePoint Capital, the Adviser, and the Administrator 
 TriplePoint Capital 
 TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is headquartered on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley with regional offices currently located in San Francisco, New York City and Boston, and has a primary focus in technology and other high growth industries. TPC s portfolio of venture capital-backed companies has included and/or includes widely recognized and industry-leading companies around the world. 
 TPC s global investment platform serves venture capital-backed companies backed by its select group of leading venture capital investors across all stages of development of a venture capital-backed company s lifecycle with dedicated business segments focused on providing creative, flexible and customized debt financings and complementary services at each stage. TPC currently categorizes venture capital-backed companies into the following five lifecycle stages of development: seed, early, later, venture growth and public. TPC has other business segments, in addition to the Company, that target investments in these lifecycle stages. 
 TPC utilizes a unique, relationship-based lending strategy that primarily targets companies funded by a select group of leading venture capital investors, which TPC refers to as the TriplePoint Lifespan Approach. Key elements of the TriplePoint Lifespan Approach include: 
 establishing debt financing relationships with select venture capital-backed companies primarily across all five lifecycle stages of development; 
 working with TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors to identify debt financing opportunities within their portfolio companies that TPC believes have established management teams, strong investor support, large market opportunities, innovative technology or intellectual property and sufficient cash on hand and equity backing to support a potential debt financing opportunity on attractive risk-adjusted terms; 
 developing debt financing relationships as early as possible in a venture capital-backed company s lifecycle in order to have a real-time understanding of the company s capital needs and be in a strategic position to evaluate and capitalize on additional investment opportunities as the company matures; 
 diligently monitoring the progress and ongoing creditworthiness of a borrower; and 
 serving as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner with a focus on efficiency, responsiveness and customer service. 
 Our Adviser 
 Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser, which is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), and is a wholly owned subsidiary of TPC. Our Adviser is responsible for sourcing, reviewing and structuring investment opportunities for us, underwriting and performing due diligence on our investments and monitoring our investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser was organized in August 2013 and, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), we pay our Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. For information regarding our Adviser and the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, see -Management Agreements-Investment Advisory Agreement below. 
 The Adviser s senior investment team is led by the Adviser s co-founders, James P. Labe and Sajal K. Srivastava, who are highly experienced and disciplined in providing debt financing across all stages of a venture capital-backed company s lifecycle and have developed long-standing relationships with, and have an established history of investing alongside, premier venture capital investors as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner. Our Adviser s co-founders have worked together for more than 23 years and its senior investment team includes professionals with extensive experience and backgrounds in technology and other high growth industries as well as in venture capital, private equity and credit. The Adviser s senior investment team has an average of more than 20 years of relevant experience and an extensive network of industry contacts and venture capital relationships.

Our Administrator 
 Our administrative functions are provided by our Administrator. Our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under an administration agreement with our Administrator (the Administration Agreement ), we pay our Administrator an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors (the Board )) of our Administrator s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. For information regarding our Administrator and expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, see -Management Agreements-Administration Agreement below. 
 Investment Strategy 
 Overview 
 Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by relying on a core investment philosophy described as the Four Rs. The Four Rs stand for: 
 Relationships We seek to develop and maintain deep, longstanding and mutually beneficial relationships with TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs. 
 Reputation We seek to preserve and extend the strong reputation of TPC s brand and franchise as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner with a focus on efficiency, responsiveness and customer service when interacting with venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs and when originating, structuring, underwriting and monitoring our investments. 
 Referenc es We seek to make every venture capital investor, borrower and entrepreneur with whom we work a reference so that they not only work with us again but also encourage others to work with us. We believe that receiving referrals from TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs is a critical part of our investment origination process and differentiates us from other lenders. 
 Returns We believe that by focusing on relationships, reputation and references, in addition to utilizing our specialized and established credit and monitoring process, we will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. 
 We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment or the entire company, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns. 
 Target Venture Growth Stage Companies 
 We primarily target investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies backed by venture capital investors. However, having backing from a venture capital investor does not guarantee financing from us. Prospective borrowers must further qualify based on our Adviser s rigorous and established investment selection and underwriting criteria and generally have many of the following characteristics: 
 financing from a member of TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors with whom TPC has an established history of providing secured loans alongside equity investments made by these venture capital investors; 
 focused in technology or other high growth industries and targeting an industry segment or sub-sector with a large and/or growing market opportunity; 
 completion of their primary technology and product development; 
 meaningful customer sales, commitments or orders and have generated or we believe are reasonably expected to generate within the current fiscal year or on an annualized run rate at least 20 million in revenues and a strong outlook for continued and/or potentially rapid revenue growth; 
 a leadership position in its market (or the potential to establish a leadership position) with potential and/or defensible barriers to entry; 
 an experienced and relatively complete senior management team with a successful track record; 
 support from existing venture capital investors in the form of meaningful invested equity capital relative to our investment amount and/or reserved capital or willingness to invest additional capital as needed; 
 strong likelihood of raising additional equity capital or achieving an exit in the form of an initial public offering or sale based on the determination of our Adviser and its investment experience and history of investing in venture growth stage companies; 
 3 

differentiated products, unique technology, proprietary intellectual property, and/or positive clinical results that may have intrinsic value on a stand-alone and/or liquidation basis; 
 meaningful enterprise value or the potential for meaningful growth in enterprise value relative to the size of our investment as indicated by a recent equity round valuation or in the opinion of our Adviser s senior investment team; 
 a balanced current financial condition typically with 12 months or more of operating cash runway based on its projected cash burn and/or a path to profitability typically over a three- to five-year period from the date of our investment; and 
 upcoming strategic and potential enterprise valuation-accreting business milestones that our investment can help provide operating cash runway for the company to achieve. 
 As a matter of practice, the evaluation of these criteria and characteristics, including the meaningful nature thereof, will involve subjective judgments and determinations by our Adviser, drawing upon its prior investment experience. 
 For many venture capital-backed companies, we believe that the venture growth stage is generally the point in their lifecycle at which they begin operational and financial preparations for a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or private sale. We believe these investments provide us with a stable, fixed-income revenue stream along with the potential for equity-related gains on a risk-adjusted basis. We invest opportunistically in venture capital-backed companies at other lifecycle stages of development when our Adviser s senior investment team believes that they present an attractive investment opportunity for us. 
 Invest with TPC s Select Group of Leading Venture Capital Investors 
 We generally expect to (i) benefit from the relationships developed by TPC as part of its TriplePoint Lifespan Approach and (ii) target investment opportunities backed by a select group of leading venture capital investors. We believe these well-recognized firms have consistently generated strong returns through superior selection processes and access to experienced entrepreneurs and quality investment opportunities based upon their strong reputations and track records, specialized knowledge and experienced investment professionals. As a result of this strategy, we focus and narrow our investment sourcing efforts to those investment opportunities backed by these leading venture capital investors with established track records targeting investments in Silicon Valley, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Northern Virginia, San Diego, Seattle, the United Kingdom, Israel and other geographic areas of venture capital investments. We believe these relationships serve as an important source of investment opportunity referrals for us. We work with our select group of leading venture capital investors to identify debt financing opportunities within their portfolio companies that we believe have established management teams, strong venture capital investor support, large market opportunities, innovative technology or intellectual property, potential for meaningful warrant and/or equity investment returns and sufficient cash reserves to complement a potential debt financing opportunity. 
 Focus in Technology and other High Growth Industries 
 We generally target technology and other high growth industries and further specialize in subsectors within each of these industries including: 
 Technology areas of focus include: big data, cloud computing, communications, consumer, data storage, electronics, energy efficiency, hardware, information services, internet and media, networking, semiconductors, software, software-as-a-service, wireless communications and other technology-related subsectors; and 
 Other High Growth Industries areas of focus vary depending upon our Adviser s investment strategy. 
 Our Adviser seeks to invest in those subsectors where our Adviser sees opportunities for innovation, globalization, demand and other drivers of change which create significant business opportunities for venture growth stage companies with cutting edge or disruptive technology, differentiated value propositions and sustainable competitive advantages. As a result, we believe that companies in these subsectors are more likely to attract significant investment from venture capital investors, private equity firms or strategic partners and are a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry. 
 We generally view high growth industries as industries which experience a higher than average growth rate as compared to others as a result of demand for new products or services offered by companies in these industries. These companies also generally have a global business strategy and products or services that appeal to customers and consumers worldwide. It is this demand and the potential global addressable market for their products or services that makes these industries and companies attractive to venture capital investment and therefore attractive lending candidates for us.

Offer Creative Financing Solutions with Attractive Risk-Adjusted Pricing 
 Debt financings for venture growth stage companies are extremely diverse with use of proceeds, repayment structures and value propositions varying considerably among different company types. Our debt financings are customized based on a host of factors, including our review, assessment and analysis of each company s management team, business outlook, underlying technology, support from its venture capital investors, products or services, current and future financial profile, intended use of our proceeds and anticipated payback structure, timing of a liquidity event and return potential. The diversity of debt financing possibilities requires prospective lenders to demonstrate a high degree of venture lending and leasing expertise, technology and other high growth industries knowledge and specialization, and willingness to provide customized products and flexibility. We believe the members of our Adviser s senior investment team are uniquely situated given their extensive industry background, track record, knowledge and lending experience in the technology and other high growth industries, as well as venture capital, private equity and credit, to analyze, structure and underwrite such debt financings. We believe that we have the ability to appropriately price the investment opportunities we originate based upon the debt structures we employ and the individual risk profiles of our borrowers to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for us and our stockholders. 
 Generate Equity Upside over Time through Warrant and Equity Investments 
 In connection with our secured loans, we generally receive warrant investments to acquire preferred or common stock in a venture growth stage company with an exercise price typically equal to the same price per share paid by the company s venture capital investors in its last round of equity financing or a recent valuation of the venture growth stage company as determined by a third party or in its next round of equity financing. Our warrant investment coverage generally ranges from 2 to 10 of the committed loan amount. The warrant investments we obtain typically include a cashless exercise provision to allow us to exercise these rights without any additional cash investment. We also generally receive the opportunity to invest equity directly in our venture growth stage companies. We believe that making equity investments and receiving warrant investments in venture growth stage companies with exit events on the horizon, such as an initial public offering or private sale, increases the likelihood of equity appreciation and enhanced investment returns. As a venture growth stage company s enterprise value changes, we may recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our warrant and equity investments, and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we expect to achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the exercise of these warrant investments and the sale of the underlying stock. 
 Utilize a Disciplined Investment Process 
 Our Adviser s senior investment team leverages the more than 50 years of combined experience and expertise of James P. Labe and Sajal K. Srivastava, TPC s co-founders, and the track record developed by them at TPC since its inception for reviewing prospective borrowers and potential financings, structuring those financings and subsequently monitoring those that are pursued and made, through which our Adviser s senior investment team has succeeded in making profitable investments and minimizing credit losses. Additionally, we believe that the credit performance of our venture growth stage companies and the returns associated with lending to these companies are enhanced through our Adviser s focus on originating investments primarily backed by TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors and having an understanding of their outlook and/or support of our prospective and existing borrowers. 
 Employ Active Portfolio Management Processes 
 Our Adviser utilizes an extensive internal credit tracking and monitoring approach to regularly follow a borrower s actual financial performance and achievement of business-related milestones to ensure that the internal risk rating assigned to each borrower is appropriate. This process has been refined and validated by Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, and the track record developed by TPC since its inception and is based, in part, on its expertise, familiarity and deep understanding of the risk associated with investing in various stages of a venture capital-backed company s lifespan. The analysis focuses on both quantitative metrics, such as cash balance and cash burn, and our Adviser s qualitative assessment in various areas, such as the outlook for the borrower s industry segment, progress of product development, overall adherence to the business plan, financial condition, future growth potential and ability to raise additional equity capital. Our Adviser maintains dialogue and contact with our borrowers management teams to discuss, among other topics, business progress, cash flow, financial condition and capital structure matters. Our Adviser also typically engages in dialogue with the venture capital investors in our borrowers to understand and assess the borrower s progress and development and the venture capital investor s outlook and/or level of support for our borrower and in conjunction with the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, determines the appropriate course of action with respect to investments in borrowers on our Credit Watch List (as described further below).

Investment Structure 
 We offer a full range of creative, flexible and customized secured financing products which may include a combination of an initial facility fee, interest and principal payments, end-of-term payments and warrant and/or equity investment rights. Although the general components for each type of our debt financing products are substantially the same, we select and customize the specific debt financing product on a case-by-case basis based on our Adviser s senior investment team s experience and their analysis of a prospective borrower, its financing needs and its intended use of the proceeds from our debt financing product. For example, the type of debt financing transaction, the total repayment period, the interest-only period, the amortization period, the collateral position, the warrant investment coverage and the overall yield-to-maturity may vary. We make investments that our Adviser s senior investment team believes have a low probability of loss due to their expertise and the revenue profile, product validation, customer commitments, intellectual property, financial condition and enterprise value of the potential opportunity. Our debt financing products are typically structured as lines of credit, whereby a prospective borrower may be required to draw some of the commitment amount at close but may have up to 24 months from document execution to access the remaining available commitment amount of debt financing capital and, in many cases future advances may be subject to certain predetermined performance milestones and other conditions. 
 Growth Capital Loans 
 Key typical attributes of our growth capital loans include: 
 Size ranges from 5 million to 50 million. We generally target and balance our growth capital loan size to the total equity capital base, the current or near-term enterprise value, value of intellectual property, revenue run rate and current or near-term cash and liquidity profile of a prospective borrower; 
 Short total repayment periods typically ranging from 36 to 60 months or less that provide for interest-only or moderate loan amortization in the early period of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until 24 to 48 months after the loan s funding date or a large lump sum payment on its maturity; 
 Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 10 to 18 , which may include current interest payments at fixed or floating rates, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a payment-in-kind PIK interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are generally a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. A meaningful portion of the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan is recognized as non-cash income until it is paid; 
 Equity kickers in the form of warrant investments to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any potential equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 
 Secured by a senior secured lien on all of the prospective borrower s assets including a pledge or negative pledge on its intellectual property. For certain prospective borrowers we are the only form of secured debt (other than potentially specific equipment financing). Other prospective borrowers may also have a revolving loan, typically from a bank, to finance receivables, cash, billings, bookings, inventory, or working capital and the collateral for such financing may be the underlying financed asset, bank accounts and/or a senior lien having priority over our senior lien. In addition, there may be prospective borrowers that have a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, typically from a bank, that may have priority over our senior lien; and 
 Limited and/or flexible covenant structures and with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage and reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third-party expenses, as well as prepayment penalties. 
 Equipment Financings 
 Key typical attributes of our equipment financings include: 
 Size ranges from 5 million to 50 million. We generally target the size of our equipment financing to anticipate the capital equipment needs for a prospective borrower over a twelve month period balanced by the total equity capital base, the current or near-term enterprise value, value of intellectual property, revenue run rate and current or near-term cash and liquidity profile of a prospective borrower; 
 Short total repayment periods typically ranging from 36 to 48 months or less that provide for short interest-only periods followed by full amortization; 
 Structured as full payout loans or leases with either buyout provisions based on the fair market value of the financed equipment or a fixed end-of term payment; 
 Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 10 to 15 , which may include current interest payments at fixed or floating rates, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a PIK interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are generally a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. The portion of our end-of-term payments that equal the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan are recognized as non-cash income until they are paid; 
 6 

Equity kickers in the form of warrant investments to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any potential equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 
 Secured primarily by the underlying equipment being financed and/or a secured lien on all assets. We expect that much of the equipment financed by us will consist of standard, off-the-shelf equipment, such as computers, electronic test and measurement, telecommunications, laboratory equipment, manufacturing or production equipment. In certain cases, a portion of an equipment financing may finance customized equipment, software and/or expenses or soft-costs which may not have any substantial resale value; and 
 Limited and/or flexible covenant structures with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions and reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third-party expenses, as well as prepayment penalties. 
 Revolving Loans 
 On a select basis, we offer revolving loans. Key typical attributes of our revolving loans include the following: 
 Size ranges from 1 million to 50 million. We generally structure our revolving loans subject to an advance rate against the company s inventory, supply-chain components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, marketing spend, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent, that serve as our sole or primary collateral in support of the repayment of such loans; 
 Short total repayment periods typically ranging from 12 to 36 months or less that typically provide for interest-only periods and/or moderate loan amortization in the early period of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until 12 to 24 months after the loan s funding date or on its maturity date; 
 Unlevered yield-to-maturity generally ranging from 1 above the applicable prime rate to 10 , which may include current interest payments at fixed or floating rates, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a PIK interest payment. Our end-of-term payments are contractual and fixed interest payments due at the maturity date of the loan, including upon prepayment, and are generally a fixed percentage of the original principal balance of the loan. The portion of our end-of-term payments that equal the difference between our yield-to-maturity and the stated interest rate on the loan are recognized as non-cash income until they are paid; 
 Equity kickers in the form of warrant investments to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 
 Secured by a senior secured lien on all of the prospective borrower s assets including a pledge or negative pledge on its intellectual property or on all of the specific assets financed specifically by the revolving loan such as the company s inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections, including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent; and 
 Some financial covenants which may include advance rates, borrowing formulas, excess concentrations, cash requirements, business contracts or milestones along with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage and reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third-party expenses, as well as prepayment penalties. 
 Warrant Investments 
 In connection with our secured loans, we generally receive warrant investments to acquire preferred or common stock in a venture growth stage company with an exercise price typically equal to the same price per share paid by the company s venture capital investors in its last round of equity financing or a recent valuation of the venture growth stage company as determined by a third party or in its next round of equity financing. As a venture growth stage company s enterprise value changes we expect to recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our warrant investments, and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we may achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the exercise of these warrant investments and the sale of the underlying stock. Warrant investments granted in connection with our secured loans are typically based on a percentage of the committed loan amount, are treated as original issue discount OID and may be earned at document execution and/or as the loan is funded. Warrant coverage generally ranges from 2 to 10 of the committed loan amount.

Direct Equity Investments 
 In connection with our secured loans, we may obtain equity investment rights that allow us to invest in a venture growth stage company s current or next round of private equity financing on the same terms and conditions as the company s venture capital investors and/or other equity investors in the round. In some cases, we may make a direct equity investment in a prospective portfolio company prior to transacting a potential secured loan with the company. As a venture growth stage company s enterprise value changes we recognize unrealized gains or losses from the fair value changes in our direct equity investments, and in conjunction with either a sale of the company or in connection with or following an initial public offering, we may achieve additional investment returns and realized gains from the sale of the underlying stock. These equity investment rights typically range from 100,000 to 5.0 million in size (generally not exceeding 5 of the company s total equity), although we are under no obligation to make any such investment. Typically, these are passive investments (we do not take a board of directors seat in the company) but can be strategically valuable and beneficial as an enhancement to our relationship with the venture growth stage company and to our economic return by generating meaningful return on capital committed. 
 Brokerage Allocation and Other Practices 
 Since we acquire and dispose of many of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, many of the transactions that we engage in do not require the use of brokers or the payment of brokerage commissions. Subject to policies established by our Board, our Adviser is primarily responsible for selecting brokers and dealers to execute transactions with respect to the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. Our Adviser does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer but seeks to obtain the best net results for us under the circumstances, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution and operational facilities of the firm and the firm s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. Our Adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive trade execution costs but does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, our Adviser may select a broker based upon brokerage or research services provided to our Adviser and us and any other clients. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if our Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided. We also pay brokerage commissions incurred in connection with open-market purchases pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan. The aggregate amount of brokerage commissions paid by us during the three most recent fiscal years is 39,000. 
 Investment Criteria 
 Our Adviser (i) benefits from the relationships developed by TPC as part of its TriplePoint Lifespan Approach and (ii) typically sources investment opportunities with TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors or directly from prospective borrowers who are seeking debt financing. Many of these prospective borrowers are attracted to TPC s reputation, extensive track record in the venture growth stage debt market, the Four Rs core investment philosophy, and/or may have previously had a lending relationship with TPC. Additional origination sources for our Adviser include an extensive network of strategic industry contacts, including former and current venture growth stage companies, financial advisers, commercial banks and accounting and law firms. Our Adviser also identifies companies with strong management teams and innovative technology to proactively generate debt financing opportunities. 
 We primarily target investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies that have received equity investments from venture capital investors. However, having backing from a venture capital investor does not guarantee financing from us. Prospective borrowers must further qualify based on our Adviser s rigorous and established investment selection and underwriting criteria and generally have many of the characteristics discussed above under -Investment Strategy-Target Venture Growth Stage Companies. As a matter of practice, the evaluation of these criteria and characteristics, including the meaningful nature thereof, will involve subjective judgments and determinations by our Adviser, drawing upon its prior investment experience. 
 We underwrite our transactions to ensure that our portfolio companies have a strategic and balanced intended use of our investment proceeds without us taking excessive risk and with a low likelihood of default. We believe that the profiles of the venture growth stage companies that we target mitigate our risk because we expect these companies have several options to repay our debt financing through: 
 cash flow either from achieving the strong and rapid revenue and profitability plans targeted at the time of our underwriting or in a downside risk scenario from reducing growth and associated operating expenses; 
 receiving additional cash from new equity investors based on the progress and development made by the company and their outlook for growth or in a downside risk scenario from existing equity investors to avoid them from otherwise losing all of their invested capital given our ability to foreclose on our collateral; 
 receiving acquisition offers from strategic or other financial investors or undertaking an initial public offering, given their large and growing market opportunities, the stage of development of their underlying technology and products and their financial profile; or 
 in a worst-case scenario, liquidating underlying assets including any proceeds from the sale of equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and/or intellectual property.

Upon referral or contact, a prospective borrower is added to our Adviser s client management system and assigned to one of our Adviser s originations professionals (each, an Origination Professional who becomes the prospective borrower s primary contact with us. The Originations Professional evaluates the prospective borrower in more depth to understand its debt financing needs and to determine whether or not it is qualified under our criteria. Upon initial screening, the Originations Professional generally meets with the prospective borrower and performs a preliminary investigation of the prospective borrower s management, operations and business outlook. The Originations Professional generally consults with, and gathers information from, a wide variety of industry sources to assess the prospective borrower and its industry. In addition, the Originations Professional may reach out to the prospective borrower s venture capital investors to understand the background of their investment in the company, their outlook for the company, the company s market and products, the company s goals and objectives associated with the proposed debt financing and the venture capital investor s level of support for the company. If the Originations Professional is satisfied with the preliminary assessment of the prospective borrower s management, operations and business prospects, the Originations Professional submits an internal pre-screen memorandum of the proposed debt transaction to our Adviser s senior investment team for discussion and review, as well as for pricing and structuring guidance. Each potential investment opportunity that our Adviser s Originations Professionals determine merits investment consideration is presented and evaluated at a weekly meeting in which our Adviser s senior investment team discusses the merits and risks of a potential investment opportunity, as well as the due diligence process and the pricing and structure. If our Adviser s senior investment team believes an investment opportunity fits our investment profile, the Originations Professional submits a non-binding term sheet to the prospective borrower. 
 Diligence Process 
 Assuming the non-binding term sheet submitted to the prospective borrower is subsequently executed, the investment opportunity is then subject to our Adviser s rigorous diligence and credit analysis process, which is based on its senior investment team s extensive experience and tailored specifically for venture growth stage companies. This process differs notably from traditional lending analysis, combining both qualitative and quantitative analysis and assessment, versus traditional, purely quantitative credit analyses. There is a heavy orientation towards a qualitative and subjective investment-oriented review, taking into account such factors as: 
 venture capital investor quality, track record and expected level of participation in future financing events; 
 management team experience, completeness, performance to date, and ability to perform; 
 industry segment/market attractiveness and outlook, competitive dynamics, and growth potential; 
 detailed assessment and analysis of the venture growth stage company s current products or technology and future products or technology, including value proposition and return on investment to its customers and its ability to expand and grow its customer base; 
 current and future financial position, including financial projections and sensitivity analyses, historical performance, cash balance and burn analysis, capitalization structure, feasibility of financial plan and underlying assumptions, break-even/profitability timing, future cash needs and future financing plans; 
 stage of development and execution timeline and milestones and the likelihood and feasibility of achieving such milestones; and 
 transaction risk/return profile assessing the strengths, weaknesses, risks, loan-to-value, liquidation values and outlook of the borrower compared to the structure, pricing, potential returns, likelihood of repayment and collateral structure of the proposed debt financing. 
 Our Adviser s diligence and credit analysis process typically includes visits by one of our Adviser s Investment and Credit Analysis professionals (each, an Investment and Credit Analysis Professional to a prospective borrower s headquarters and other facilities, interviews with key management and board members and reference checks on senior management. In addition, the diligence process may include discussions with key industry research analysts, other industry participants, customers and suppliers, where appropriate. One of our Adviser s professionals also typically reviews the prospective borrower s organizational documents and structure, capital structure, assets, liabilities, employee plans, key customer or supplier contracts, legal and tax matters and other relevant legal documentation. The Investment and Credit Analysis Professional submits a detailed credit and due diligence memorandum describing and analyzing the proposed transaction, as well as the outcome of the diligence and credit analysis activities. This memorandum is circulated to members of our Adviser s Investment Committee (the Investment Committee and senior investment team in advance of its meetings. 
 Investment Committee 
 The objective of the Adviser s Investment Committee and senior investment team is to leverage its members broad historical experience, including significant entrepreneurial, credit, venture capital, venture lending and venture leasing expertise and technology and other high growth industries knowledge assessing the risk and needs of venture growth stage companies and appropriateness of prospective transactions, assessing the risk/return profile of proposed transactions, assessing the independent diligence and credit analysis and providing a forum for independent and unbiased thought, discussion, and assessment. 
 9 

The Investment Committee, comprised of Mr. Labe and Mr. Srivastava, who are also members of the Adviser s senior investment team, holds votes to approve any proposed investment transaction, including follow-on investments. Additionally, members of the Adviser s senior investment team meet on at least a weekly basis to consider new and follow-on investment opportunities, with the non-Investment Committee members participating in voting on an advisory basis on all investments, which serves as an input to the Investment Committee s decisions. During these meetings, the applicable Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professional presents the transaction, results of the professional s diligence review and credit analysis and the professional s recommendations to the senior investment team. During the presentation, the investment team members in attendance typically ask questions, ask for clarifications, state opinions and assessments and make other comments. When there are no further questions and the discussions have concluded, the investment team holds an advisory vote to consider approval of the proposed transaction. In certain situations, the Investment Committee and members of the Adviser s senior investment team may ask the Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professional to perform additional analysis and resubmit the transaction at a later meeting. No single criterion determines a decision to invest. The members weigh a variety of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, when making an investment decision. Our Adviser has the discretion to modify the members of the Investment Committee and its approval process at any time without our consent. 
 Investment Monitoring and Portfolio Management 
 Our Adviser utilizes an extensive internal credit tracking and monitoring approach to regularly follow a borrower s actual financial performance and achievement of business-related milestones to ensure that the internal risk rating assigned to each borrower is appropriate. This process has been refined and validated by Mr. Labe and Mr. Srivastava, and the track record developed by TPC since its inception and is based in part on its expertise and deep understanding of the risk associated with investing in various stages of a venture capital-backed company s lifespan. The analysis focuses on both quantitative metrics, such as cash balance and cash burn, and our Adviser s qualitative assessment in various areas, such as the outlook for the borrower s industry segment, progress of product development, overall adherence to the business plan, financial condition, future growth potential and ability to raise additional equity capital. Our Adviser maintains dialogue and contact with our borrowers management teams to discuss, among other topics, business progress, cash flow, financial condition and capital structure matters. Our Adviser also typically engages in dialogue with the venture capital investors in our borrowers to understand and assess the borrower s progress and development and the venture capital investor s outlook and/or level of support for our borrower and in conjunction with the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, determines the appropriate course of action with respect to investments in borrowers on our Credit Watch List. 
 Each of our borrowers is assigned a Portfolio Company Team consisting of staff from our Adviser s Originations, Investment and Credit Analysis, Portfolio Monitoring and Legal teams. We believe having a dedicated Portfolio Company Team for each borrower further strengthens the relationship we have with the borrower, which is a key component of our Adviser s strategy and affords our Adviser consistent and continuous interaction with our borrowers. A Portfolio Monitoring professional is assigned to all borrowers to ensure compliance with financial statement and compliance reporting, insurance filing and timely payment requirements. These professionals review the various financial statements, compliance reports and other documents received from our borrowers on a monthly or quarterly basis, as well as any publicly filed financing statements, such as UCC financing statements and press releases, and enter them into our Adviser s proprietary client-management platform for review by the rest of the Portfolio Company Team. In the event of a missed payment or if other credit issues arise, the Portfolio Company Team initiates escalation procedures. 
 On a weekly basis, our Adviser s Investment Committee and senior investment team review material events and information on our borrowers and discuss in detail those borrowers that are performing below expectations. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently as needed, our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professionals undertake an extensive re-evaluation of each borrower and prepare a portfolio update. Key topics that are reviewed include timing/status of the next equity financing round, cash balance and burn rate, financial and operational progress, and covenant adherence. All of these meetings are typically attended by one or more members of our Adviser s Investment Committee, senior investment team and the Portfolio Company Team for the specific borrower being reviewed. 
 If the outlook for a borrower, its industry or a borrower s available cash balance or credit rating is materially deteriorating, or there is material downturn in the borrower s standing since our last review, we change the standing of the borrower on our Credit Watch List (as discussed below) and our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professionals contact the borrower and its venture capital investors to discuss and understand any changes. Our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professionals generally actively work to maintain an open dialogue with borrowers on the Credit Watch List to work to limit the likelihood of a default. Utilizing the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, our Adviser assesses each borrower on our Credit Watch List and, based on the recommendations from our Originations and Investment and Credit Analysis Professionals and potentially from our discussions with and representations made from the borrower s venture capital investors, determines the appropriate course of action, including decisions to enforce our rights and remedies, modify or waive a provision of our investments, declare a default, request early pay-off, or wait for an external event, such as an acquisition or financing, to restructure a secured loan or receive additional consideration in the form of fees or warrant investments. In a worst-case scenario, a member of our Portfolio Company Team sells collateral with the help of management, repossesses and auctions assets or negotiates and structures other potential outcomes. If bankruptcy is a possibility, a member of our Portfolio Company Team may utilize outside counsel to provide advice on avoiding this outcome or to minimize the adverse effects on us. 
 
 10 

Consistent with TPC s existing policies, our Adviser maintains a Credit Watch List, which places borrowers into five risk categories based upon our Adviser s senior investment team s judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2. 
 Category Category Definition Action Item Clear (1) Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Review quarterly. White (2) Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it. Reasonable financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Generally, all new loans are initially graded White (2). Contact portfolio company periodically; in no event less than quarterly. Yellow (3) Performing generally below expectations and/or some proactive concern due to industry, business, financial and/or related factors. Adequate financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Contact portfolio company monthly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors. Orange (4) Needs close attention due to performance materially below expectations, weak financial and/or enterprise profile, concern regarding additional capital or exit equivalent. Contact portfolio company weekly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors regularly; our Adviser forms a workout group to minimize risk of loss. Red (5) Serious concern/trouble due to pending or actual default or equivalent. May experience partial and/or full loss. Maximize value from assets. 
 Competition 
 Debt financing for venture capital-backed companies is particularly heterogeneous the type, structures and sizes of debt financings often vary significantly depending on a particular company s industry and its current or near-term stage of development. The profile and underwriting characteristics of an early stage venture capital-backed company are very different from those of a later stage venture capital-backed company and/or those of a venture growth stage company. Furthermore, within venture growth stage companies, the uses, structures and value propositions of debt financing vary considerably among companies and industries and require a high degree of venture lending and venture leasing expertise and technology and other high growth industries knowledge, specialization and flexibility from a lender. The availability of debt financing for venture growth stage companies is further limited by factors such as the brand, reputation and market acceptance, industry relationships, track record, and other factors required to lend to companies backed by leading venture capital investors. In addition, a lender must understand the distinct credit profiles of these companies and have the deep experience and specialized set of skills required to (i) source deal flow and receive investment referrals; (ii) evaluate high growth industries and sectors, business prospects, operating characteristics and collateral; (iii) analyze potential transactions; and (iv) customize unconventional transaction structures for these companies. 
 We believe that venture-oriented banks tend to be the primary form of traditional lenders participating in the market for venture growth stage companies and that they generally focus on providing lower risk and lower return financings, which tend to require and impose many restrictive covenants and conditions on borrowers, such as minimum cash balances, financial covenants, limitations on outflows and borrowing formulas and require a significant depository relationship to facilitate rapid liquidation. In addition, we believe that most existing non-traditional debt providers do not regularly or actively participate in venture growth stage lending due to their reluctance to underwrite the large financings required by venture growth stage companies, as well as the desire of these providers to structure deals with lower current return but with the potential for significantly higher equity upside through warrant investments by lending to companies with lower valuations than would be possible in the venture growth stage lending market. As a result, most existing providers of debt financing tend to focus on seed, early and late-stage venture capital-backed companies instead of venture growth stage companies. 
 Our competitors include both existing and newly formed equity and debt focused public and private funds, other BDCs, investment banks, venture-oriented banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, we believe some of our competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which expose them to a wider variety of investments. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 We believe we compete effectively with these entities primarily on the basis of TPC s reputation, track record, experience, industry knowledge and relationships and our Adviser s senior investment team s contacts, efficient investment analysis, decision-making processes, creative financing products and highly customized investment terms. We believe that the Four Rs, our core investment philosophy, enable us to continue to grow our brand name, reputation and differentiate us from our competitors. We do not compete primarily on the financing terms we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable or lower than our rates. We also believe that our relationship-based approach to investing, which leverages our Adviser s senior investment team s expertise in developing strong relationships with venture capital investors and venture capital-backed companies, understanding the capital needs of venture growth stage companies, and structuring and customizing attractive financing solutions to meet the financing needs throughout a company s growth stage, enables us to identify, attract and proactively capitalize on venture growth stage companies debt needs as they grow and become successful enterprises.

Employees 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates, and the Administrator, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and/or the Administration Agreement, each as described below. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser, and we reimburse our Administrator for our allocable portion of expenses incurred pursuant to the Administration Agreement, as described below. 
 Management Agreements 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 Subject to the overall supervision of our Board and in accordance with the 1940 Act, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser: 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; 
 executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; 
 determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; 
 performs due diligence on prospective investments; and 
 provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser a fee for its investment advisory and management services consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee is ultimately borne by our stockholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75 of our average adjusted gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of our two most recently completed calendar quarters. Such amount is appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee, which provides our Adviser with a share of the income that it generates for us, consists of two components investment income and capital gains which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not payable. 
 Under the investment income component, we pay our Adviser each quarter 20.0 of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of 2.0 (which is 8.0 annualized) of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which our Adviser receives all of such income in excess of the 2.0 level but less than 2.5 and subject to a total return requirement. The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5 in any calendar quarter, our Adviser receives 20.0 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the 2.0 hurdle rate did not apply. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent that 20.0 of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of our election to be regulated as a BDC (March 5, 2014) exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0 of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0 hurdle rate, subject to the catch-up provision and (ii) (x) 20.0 of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses since March 5, 2014. 
 12 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement described in the preceding paragraph. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable income incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our assets used to calculate the 1.75 base management fee. These calculations are appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee. 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 
 
 Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to first component of incentive fee 
 Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee, we pay our Adviser at the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement) 20.0 of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of that year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the foregoing purpose, our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains does not include any unrealized gains. It should be noted that we accrue an incentive fee for accounting purposes taking into account any unrealized gains in accordance with GAAP. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee is payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. 
 Payment of Our Expenses 
 All professionals of our Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by our Adviser and not by us.

The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days written notice. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-We are dependent upon our executive officers, our Adviser s senior investment team and, in particular, Messrs. Labe and Srivastava, for our success and upon our Adviser s access to such individuals pursuant to the Staffing Agreement. If our Adviser were to lose such access, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its professionals and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.

 The Investment Advisory Agreement between us and our Adviser was initially approved by our Board at an in-person meeting in November 2013 and entered into in February 2014. Our Board most recently determined to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement at a meeting held on October 28, 2022. In reaching a decision to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 
 the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser to us; 
 the investment performance of the Company and the Adviser; 
 comparative data with respect to the investment performance of other BDCs with similar investment objectives, strategies, risks, restrictions and types of securities purchased; 
 the fee structure under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Adviser s anticipated costs of providing services to us; 
 comparative data with respect to advisory and incentive fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives and asset levels; 
 our operating expenses compared to those of other BDCs with similar investment objectives, strategies, risks, restrictions and types of securities purchased; 
 14 

any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; 
 information about the services performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 economies of scale realized by the Adviser (or that possibly might be realized by the Adviser in the future) in connection with the Adviser s provision of services to us; and 
 the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser. 
 Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, the Board, including all of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services provided and re-approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. The Board did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. Individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors. 
 Administration Agreement 
 The Administration Agreement provides that our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and providing us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator performs, or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, our Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 
 In consideration of the provision of the services of our Administrator, we reimburse our Administrator for the costs and expenses incurred by our Administrator in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board) of our Administrator s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, our Administrator is paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such companies for providing this assistance. The Administration Agreement between us and the Administrator was initially approved by our Board at an in-person meeting in November 2013 and was entered into in February 2014. 
 Our Board most recently determined to re-approve the Administration Agreement at a meeting held on October 28, 2022. In connection with such approval, the Board, including a majority of independent directors, reviewed the payments made by us to the Administrator to determine that the provisions of the Administration Agreement are carried out satisfactorily and to determine, among other things, whether the payments made by us under the Administration Agreement are reasonable in light of the services provided. The Board also reviewed the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and the affiliates of TPC. The Board then assessed the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the nature and quality of the administrative services provided to us by the Administrator, our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives, any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Administrator from its relationship with us, information about the administrative services to be performed and the personnel performing such administrative services, the organizational capability of the Administrator, and the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers. 
 The Administration Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by the Board. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement. 
 The Administration Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Administrator and any person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Administrator s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator.

Staffing Agreement 
 Our Adviser has entered into the Staffing Agreement with TPC (the Staffing Agreement ). Pursuant to the Staffing Agreement, TPC has made and will continue to make, subject to the terms of the Staffing Agreement, its investment and portfolio management and monitoring teams available to our Adviser. We believe that the Staffing Agreement (i) provides us with access to deal flow generated by TPC in the ordinary course of its business; (ii) provides us with access to TPC s investment professionals, including its senior investment team led by Mr. Labe and Mr. Srivastava, and TPC s non-investment employees; and (iii) commits certain key senior members of TPC s Investment Committee to serve as members of our Adviser s Investment Committee. Our Adviser is responsible for determining if we will participate in deal flow generated by TPC. Our Adviser takes advantage of the significant deal origination channels, rigorous due diligence process, disciplined underwriting methods, creative investment structuring and comprehensive portfolio management and investment monitoring capabilities of TPC s senior investment team. The Staffing Agreement may be terminated by either party with 60 days prior written notice. 
 License Agreement 
 We have entered into the License Agreement with TPC under which TPC granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name TriplePoint and the TriplePoint logo. Under the License Agreement, we have a right to use the TriplePoint name for so long as our Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the TriplePoint name. 
 Determination of Net Asset Value 
 Quarterly Determinations 
 We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock on at least a quarterly basis. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding. 
 Our investment assets are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by our Board. Our investments are primarily made to venture growth stage companies in technology and other high growth industries. Given the nature of lending to these types of companies, our investments are generally considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investments to be traded or exchanged. As such, we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board pursuant to a consistent valuation policy in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 The valuation committee of the Board (the Valuation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. We value our portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value, as determined in good faith by the Board, with the assistance of the Adviser and independent valuation agents, in accordance with Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act and GAAP, and in accordance with our valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Adviser considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and selects a value within that range that most accurately represents fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser s valuation committee considers relevant. 
 The Board determines fair value of its investments on at least a quarterly basis or at such other times when it feels it would be appropriate to do so given the circumstances. A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates and depends on the facts and circumstances present at each valuation date. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value of portfolio investments that do not have a readily available market value, fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 The fair value of our investments is measured in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 
 Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Valuations are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable. 
 16 

Level 3 Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuations techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the investment. 
 Under ASC Topic 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset, which may be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. The principal market for any asset is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for such asset in which the reporting entity would or could sell or transfer the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability under ASC Topic 820, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to such market as of the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. See Note 4. Investments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our valuation process. 
 For purposes of Section 2(a)(41) and Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, a market quotation is readily available only when that quotation is a quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments that we can access at the measurement date, provided that a quotation will not be readily available if it is not reliable. Any portfolio investment that is not priced using a Level 1 input shall be subject to the fair value determination requirements under Rule 2a-5 and subject to our valuation procedures. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment receiving a proposed valuation by the Adviser. The Adviser s internal valuation committee (the Adviser Valuation Committee is responsible for the valuation process, including making preliminary valuation conclusions and recommendations to the Valuation Committee and Board. The Adviser Valuation Committee does not include any voting members who are portfolio managers or investment professionals. 
 The Adviser s Portfolio Valuation, Monitoring and Analytics VMA group is responsible for aiding and supporting the Adviser Valuation Committee in the Adviser Valuation Committee s role of overseeing the valuation process, including for calculating and overseeing the valuation process and valuation conclusions, and including making recommendations with respect to discount rates, liquidity adjustments and other key inputs into the valuation process. 
 Proposed valuations are then documented and discussed with the Adviser Valuation Committee and other members of the Adviser s senior management, including members of the VMA and the Adviser s Finance, Operations, Legal and Compliance groups. 
 At least 25 of the Company s investment portfolio will receive valuation recommendations from an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter, as selected in accordance with the Company s valuation policy. Each new portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm within 12 months of the date of investment, and thereafter will be reviewed by an independent third-party valuation firm no later than the fourth quarter following its most recent inclusion in such review process. However, a valuation review by an independent third-party valuation firm is not required for holdings whose value is less than 1 of the Company s gross assets (up to an aggregate of 10 of the Company s gross assets) or those assets that the Board and/or Valuation Committee has agreed to waive from such requirement. 
 The Adviser and the independent third-party valuation firms, if applicable, then present their proposed valuations to the Valuation Committee and Board, and the Board makes a fair valuation determination for each portfolio investment that is to be fair valued. 
 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 Taxation of the Company 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute (or are deemed to timely distribute) to our stockholders as dividends. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things: 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership, or QPTP, hereinafter the 90 Gross Income Test; and 
 diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year: 
 17 

at least 50 of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs, and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5 of the value of our total assets and not more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and 
 not more than 25 of the value of our total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other RICs), the securities of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more QPTPs, hereinafter the Diversification Tests. 
 In the case of a RIC that furnishes capital to development corporations, there is an exception relating to the Diversification Tests described above. This exception is available only to RICs which the SEC determines to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, which we refer to as SEC Certification. We have not sought SEC Certification, but we may seek SEC Certification in future years. If we receive SEC Certification, we generally will be entitled to include, in the computation of the 50 value of our assets (described above), the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not we own more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, if the basis of the securities, when added to our basis of any other securities of the issuer that we own, does not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in any taxable year with respect to which we distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of the sum of our (i) investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net realized short-term capital gains over net realized long-term capital losses and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), (the Annual Distribution Requirement ). We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. Generally, if we fail to meet this Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for such taxable year. Although we may meet our Annual Distribution requirement, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, unless we timely distribute (or are deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of: 
 at least 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 
 at least 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and 
 certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while any senior securities are outstanding unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios. See Regulation Senior Securities. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Taxation of Company Investments 
 Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (iii) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90 Gross Income Test. We monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and to prevent disqualification of us as a RIC but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. 
 
 18 

Debt Instruments 
 In certain circumstances, we may be required to recognize taxable income prior to which we receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with an end-of-term payment and/or PIK interest payment or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrant investments), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrant investments or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 Warrant Investments 
 Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrant investments acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrant investments generally are treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term generally depends on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 Foreign Investments 
 In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the requirement to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us. 
 Passive Foreign Investment Companies 
 We may invest in the stock of a foreign corporation which is classified as a passive foreign investment company (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or PFIC. In general, unless a special tax election has been made, we are required to pay tax at ordinary income rates on any gains and excess distributions with respect to PFIC stock as if such items had been realized ratably over the period during which we held the PFIC stock, plus an interest charge. Certain adverse tax consequences of a PFIC investment may be limited if we are eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to such investment. No assurances can be given that any such election will be available or that, if available, we will make such an election. 
 Foreign Currency Transactions 
 Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time we accrue income or other receivables or accrue expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such receivables or pay such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, on disposition of debt instruments and certain other instruments denominated in a foreign currency, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations if the value of the foreign currency between the date of acquisition of the instrument and the date of disposition also are treated as ordinary income or loss. These currency fluctuations related gains and losses may increase or decrease the amount of our investment company taxable income to be distributed to our stockholders as ordinary income. 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and if certain cure provisions described below are not available, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend; non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years. 
 
 19 

Regulation 
 We are regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates and requires that a majority of the directors of a BDC be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company in excess of the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these current limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3 of the voting stock of any registered investment company or BDC, invest more than 5 of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or BDC, or invest more than 10 of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies and BDCs, subject to compliance with certain exceptions. 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests, and if our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time will decrease and you may experience dilution. 
 At our 2018 Annual Stockholders Meeting, our stockholders authorized our ability to issue options, warrants or rights to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase shares of our common stock, which may include convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures, under appropriate circumstances in connection with our capital raising and financing activities, subject to applicable restrictions under the 1940 Act (including, without limitation, that at the date of issuance of the options, warrants or rights, (i) the number of shares that would result from the exercise or conversion of all of the Company s options, warrants or rights to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase our common stock does not exceed 25 of our then-outstanding shares, and (2) the exercise or conversion price thereof is not less than the market value per share of our common stock). Such authorization has no expiration. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the BDC s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets that are applicable to us are the following: 
 (1) securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: 
 is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 satisfies either of the following: 
 i. does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a 250 million market capitalization maximum; or 
 ii. is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
 (2) securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
 (3) securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrant investments or rights relating to such securities. 
 (4) cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 
 The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 We generally look through our subsidiaries to the underlying holdings (considered together with portfolio assets held outside of our subsidiaries) for purposes of determining compliance with the 70 qualifying assets requirement of the 1940 Act. On a consolidated basis, we expect that at least 70 of our assets will be eligible assets. 
 20 

Under Section 55(b) of the 1940 Act, the value of a BDC s assets shall be determined as of the date of the most recent financial statements filed by such company with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 of the 1934 Act, and shall be determined no less frequently than annually. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 BDCs generally must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of their portfolio companies, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator may provide all or a portion of this assistance pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the costs of which will be reimbursed by us at cost. We may receive fees for these services. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. If more than 25 of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests, in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of any counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Senior Securities 
 On April 24, 2018, the Board unanimously approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a) of 1940 Act. In addition, at a special meeting of stockholders held on June 21, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the 150 minimum asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, and we became subject to the 150 minimum asset coverage ratio effective June 22, 2018. Thus, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s asset coverage for borrowed amounts was . 
 In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we generally must make provisions to prohibit any cash distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios after deducting the amount of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. We consolidate our financial results with all of our wholly owned subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. The net asset value per share of our common stock may be diluted if we issue or sell securities to subscribe for or convertible into shares of our common stock. 
 Codes of Ethics 
 We and our Adviser have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. The joint code of ethics is available free of charge on our website at www.tpvg.com and on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov. 
 We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the SOX Code of Ethics ), which applies to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Adviser. A summary of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are set forth below. These policies and procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our directors who are not interested persons, as defined under the 1940 Act, of the Company, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 Introduction 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 Our Adviser s policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 Our Adviser votes proxies relating to any of our portfolio equity securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on any of the portfolio equity securities we hold. In most cases our Adviser will vote in favor of proposals that our Adviser believes are likely to increase the value of any of the portfolio equity securities we hold. Although our Adviser generally votes against proposals that may have a negative effect on any of our portfolio equity securities, our Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by our Adviser s senior investment team. To ensure that our Adviser s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, our Adviser discloses such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information without charge about how our Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: 2755 Sand Hill Road, Suite 150, Menlo Park, California 94025, Attention: Investor Relations. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as are necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
 Other 
 Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 We and our Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 
 22 

We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate without the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include concurrent investments in the same company, without prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. We are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to any person that controls us or who owns more than 25 of our voting securities and certain of that person s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. As a result of these restrictions, we may be prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than any security of which we are the issuer) from or to any company that is advised or managed by TPC, our Adviser or their affiliates without the prior approval of the SEC, which may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us. 
 We co-invest from time to time, and intend to continue making co-investments, with TPC and/or investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by TPC or its affiliates where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. We generally are only permitted to co-invest with TPC and/or such investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by TPC or its affiliates where the only term that is negotiated is price. However, on March 28, 2018, we, TPC and our Adviser received an exemptive order (the Exemptive Order from the SEC, which permits greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments with TPC and/or investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by TPC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if, among other things, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on SEC-registered companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 (1) pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 (2) pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 (3) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent that we are a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and 
 (4) pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 Corporate Governance Regulations 
 The NYSE has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We believe we are in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards. We monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and take all necessary actions to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

Assumed Return on our Portfolio (Net of Expenses) (10.0) (5.0) 0.0 5.0 10.0 Corresponding return to common stockholder assuming actual asset coverage as of December 31, 2022 (1) 
 ) ) ) 
 _______________ 
 (1) The hypothetical return to common stockholders is calculated by multiplying our total assets as of December 31, 2022 by the assumed rates of return and subtracting all interest accrued on our debt for the year ended December 31, 2022, and then dividing the resulting difference by our total assets attributable to common stock. The calculation assumes the Company had (i) 1,014.5 million in total assets, (ii) 570.0 million in total debt outstanding, (iii) 419.9 million in net assets, (v) and a weighted average cost of borrowings of . 
 Based on our outstanding indebtedness of 570.0 million as of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio would have been required to experience an annual return of at least 3.0 to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt. 
 As required by Section 18(a) and 61(a) of the 1940 Act, in connection with the issuance of certain senior securities, a provision must be made by us to prohibit the declaration of any dividend or distribution on the Company s stock, other than a dividend payable in our common stock, or the repurchase of any stock unless at the time of the dividend or distribution declaration or repurchase there is asset coverage (computed in accordance with Section 18(h) of the 1940 Act) of at least 150 on our senior securities after deducting the amount of the dividend, distribution or repurchase. 
 In addition, each of the Credit Facility and the agreements governing the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes imposes, and any debt facilities or other borrowing arrangements we may enter into in the future may impose, financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities, including limitations that hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our ability to be subject to tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.

million to portfolio companies. Our credit agreements generally contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. We cannot assure you that any of these unfunded commitments or any future obligations will be drawn by the venture growth stage companies. We have also entered into commitments with certain portfolio companies that permit an increase in the commitment amount in the future in the event that conditions to such increases are met. If such conditions to increase are met, these amounts may become unfunded commitments if not drawn prior to expiration. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any backlog of potential future commitments. 
 The actual borrowing needs of our portfolio companies may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our portfolio companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, an increasing cost of credit or the limited availability of financing from venture capital firms. In addition, investors in some of our portfolio companies may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing issues, which may increase our portfolio companies borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our portfolio companies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to use cash flow from normal and early principal repayments, indebtedness, any proceeds from any subsequent equity or debt offerings, and available cash to fund our outstanding unfunded obligations. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital available to fund these commitments as they come due. We may rely on assumptions, estimates, assurances and other information related to potential non-utilization of unfunded commitments by our portfolio companies as well as related to potential exit events, principal prepayments, and fee payments. To the extent these assumptions, estimates, assurances and other information are incorrect or events are delayed, we may not be able to fund commitments as they come due. To the extent we are not able to fund commitments as they come due, we may be forced to sell assets, modify the terms of our commitments or default on our commitments, and as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

 Item 2. Properties 
 We do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operations. Our executive offices are located at 2755 Sand Hill Road, Suite 150, Menlo Park, California 94025. These offices are provided by our Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our business. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries are currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses. We, the Adviser, and our subsidiaries may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.

 On February 28, 2023, the reported closing sales price of our common stock was per share. As of February 28, 2023, we had 9 stockholders of record, which did not include stockholders for whom shares are held in nominee or street name . 
 Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares. The possibility that shares of our common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether the shares offered hereby will trade at, above or below NAV. 
 Distributions 
 It is our intention to distribute all or substantially all of our taxable income earned over the course of the year. However, we may choose not to distribute all of our taxable income for a number of reasons, including retaining excess taxable income for investment purposes and/or to defer the payment of distributions associated with the excess taxable income for future calendar years. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded 726,000 for U.S. federal excise tax in our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, total distributions of 1.55 per share were declared and paid. On February 21, 2023, our Board declared a first quarter 2023 dividend of per share payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2023. We will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. While such return of capital distributions are not taxable, because they are a return of the stockholder s investment, net of fund expenses, they reduce a stockholder s basis in his, her, or its shares of common stock, which may result in the stockholder recognizing more taxable capital gains, or a lower capital loss, when the shares of common stock are eventually sold. 
 We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company s Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes. 
 54 

We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we were subject to a 4 U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We currently intend to distribute net long-term capital gains if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our long-term capital gains but designate the retained amount as a deemed distribution. In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include their share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to their allocable share of the tax paid on the deemed distribution by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to such stockholder s tax basis in such stockholder s common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against such individual stockholder s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds such individual stockholder s liability for U.S. federal income tax. 
 We cannot assure any stockholder that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions, and if we issue senior securities, we may be prohibited from making distributions if doing so would cause us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if such distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. 
 Unless a stockholder elects to receive distributions in cash, we intend to make such distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, investors participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. If a stockholder holds shares of our common stock in the name of a broker or financial intermediary, such stockholder should contact such broker or financial intermediary regarding the election to receive distributions in cash in lieu of shares of our common stock. Any distributions reinvested through the issuance of shares through our dividend reinvestment plan will increase our assets on which the base management fee and the incentive fee are determined and paid to our Adviser. 
 Stock Performance Graph 
 The following graph shows a comparison of the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock from March 6, 2014 (the first day of trading following our initial public offering) to December 31, 2022, with that of the NASDAQ Financial 100 Stock Index and the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index. This graph assumes that on March 6, 2014, 100 was invested in our common stock, the NASDAQ Financial 100 Stock Index, and the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index, as we do not believe there is an appropriate index of companies with an investment strategy similar to our own with which to compare the return on our common stock. The graph also assumes the reinvestment of dividends into additional shares of the same class of equity securities at the frequency with which dividends are paid on such securities during the applicable fiscal year, prior to any tax effect. The stock price performance included in this graph is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of future stock performance.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as otherwise specified, references to the Company , we , us , and our refer to TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include statements as to: 
 our and our portfolio companies future operating results and financial condition, including our and our portfolio companies ability to achieve our respective objectives; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 our relationships with third parties, including but not limited to lenders and venture capital investors, including other investors in our portfolio companies; 
 the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments; 
 the expected market for venture capital investments; 
 the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future; 
 the impact of investments that we expect to make; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC, the Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the dependence of our future success on the U.S. and global economies, including with respect to the industries in which we invest; 
 our expected financings and investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser s senior management team; 
 our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC; 
 the adequacy of our available liquidity, cash resources and working capital and compliance with covenants under our borrowing arrangements; and 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. 
 These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets; 
 the potential widespread re-emergence of COVID-19 or its variants, or a similar health pandemic, and the length and duration thereof in the United States as well as worldwide, and the magnitude of its impact and time required for economic recovery; 
 the potential for an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom; 
 a contraction of available credit, an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities; 
 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 
 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 
 57 

risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and 
 the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the symbol TPVG . 
 We were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC s investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology and other high growth industries. 
 Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology and other high growth industries backed by TPC s select group of leading venture capital investors. 
 COVID-19 Developments 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of robust economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser. 
 Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under our borrowing arrangements. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act and with our covenants under the Credit Facility and under the governing agreements for the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes. 
 We will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 or its variants on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the respective results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.

Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality 
 Portfolio Composition 
 We originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments as part of the transaction that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 327 investments in 121 companies. Our investments included 144 debt investments, 124 warrant investments, and 59 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were 959.4 million and 949.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, 11 of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2022, the 144 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of 853.0 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.8 . Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 246 investments in 91 companies. Our investments included 107 debt investments, 92 warrant investments, and 47 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were 837.8 million and 865.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 10 of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2021, the 107 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of 757.2 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 7.7 . Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.

Asset Quality 
 Consistent with TPC s existing policies, our Adviser maintains a credit watch list which places borrowers into five risk categories based on our Adviser s senior investment team s judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2. 
 Category Category Definition Action Item Clear (1) Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Review quarterly. White (2) Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it. Reasonable financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Generally, all new loans are initially graded White (2). Contact portfolio company periodically; in no event less than quarterly. Yellow (3) Performing generally below expectations and/or some proactive concern due to industry, business, financial and/or related factors. Adequate financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. Contact portfolio company monthly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors. Orange (4) Needs close attention due to performance materially below expectations, weak financial and/or enterprise profile, concern regarding additional capital or exit equivalent. Contact portfolio company weekly or more frequently as determined by our Adviser s Investment Committee; contact venture capital investors regularly; our Adviser forms a workout group to minimize risk of loss. Red (5) Serious concern/trouble due to pending or actual default or equivalent. May experience partial and/or full loss. Maximize value from assets. 
 The following table shows the credit rankings for the portfolio companies that had outstanding debt obligations to us as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.06 and 1.87, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of 43.9 million were downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). During the three months ended December 31, 2021, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: five portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of 122.5 million were upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); and two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of 41.7 million were downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3). 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had an investment in one portfolio company which was on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of 29.5 million and 9.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an investment in one portfolio company which was on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of 29.5 million and 11.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Set forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Comparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 An important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 63 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 20.1 million, which was comprised of 63.6 million of net investment income and 83.6 million of net realized and unrealized losses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 76.6 million, which was comprised of 41.1 million of net investment income and 35.5 million of net realized and unrealized gains. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, net investment income was 1.94 per share and the net decrease in net assets from operations was 0.61 per share, as compared to net investment income of 1.33 per share and a net increase in net assets from operations of 2.47 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Investment Income 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, total investment and other income was 119.4 million as compared to 87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in total investment and other income for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the 2021 period, is primarily due to a greater weighted average principal amount outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio, higher investment yields and increased prepayment activity. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized 2.9 million in other income consisting of 0.2 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 2.7 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized 4.6 million in other income consisting of 1.0 million due to the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments and 3.6 million from the realization of certain fees paid and accrued from portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses consist of our base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will generally decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized gains and losses and unrealized losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we borrow greater amounts under the Credit Facility, issue additional debt securities, and as interest rates increase. We generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses were 55.9 million as compared to 46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Base management fees for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled 15.8 million and 12.5 million, respectively. Base management fees increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio during the applicable periods used in the calculation. 
 Income incentive fees totaled 6.7 million and 10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our income incentive fee was reduced by 7.4 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of 7.4 million in net investment income. 
 There was no capital gains incentive fee expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Interest expense and amortization of fees totaled 26.8 million and 17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is primarily due to the issuance of the 2027 Notes, a greater weighted-average outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest rates. 
 Administration agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled 6.7 million and 6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to higher administration expenses under the Administration Agreement as well as increased third-party expenses. 
 Net Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 Realized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 46.0 million, primarily resulting from the disposition of investments in Medly Health Inc. and Pencil and Pixel, Inc. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net realized losses on investments of 20.0 million, consisting primarily of 15.6 million of realized losses from the sale of our investment in Knotel, Inc., which was rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and its removal from our investment portfolio, a 2.1 million realized loss from the write-off of an equity investment, 2.2 million of realized losses from the termination of warrants, and 0.1 million of other net realized losses. 
 Unrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 64 

Net change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 37.6 million, consisting of 18.2 million of net unrealized losses on the debt investment portfolio and 19.4 million of net unrealized losses on the warrant and equity portfolio resulting from the reversal of 5.7 million of previously recorded net unrealized gains realized during the period as well as fair value adjustments. 
 Net change in unrealized gains during the year ended December 31, 2021 was 56.1 million, resulting primarily from 41.2 million of net unrealized gains from fair value adjustments on our warrant and equity portfolio, the reversal and recognition of 15.6 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with Knotel, Inc., and the reversal of 2.8 million of previously recorded net unrealized losses on other investments realized during the period, partially offset by 3.5 million of net unrealized losses on our debt investment portfolio resulting from fair value adjustments. 
 Net change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors. 
 Portfolio Yield and Total Return 
 Investment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term EOT payments. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, interest income totaled 116.6 million and 82.8 million, respectively, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments for the period held of 14.7 and 13.7 , respectively. 
 We calculate weighted average annualized portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the yield on our total debt portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments, was 13.4 and 12.1 , respectively. 
 The following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our total debt portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:

 (1) Weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. 
 (2) The weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders. 
 Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor s yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. 
 Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was (3.3) and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was (33.7) . For the year ended December 31, 2021, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 19.9 and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 52.8 .

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates, including with respect to the valuation of our investments, could cause actual results to differ. 
 Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management s judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We have identified the valuation of our investment portfolio, including our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by the Board), as our critical accounting policy and estimates. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the risks described under Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A. 
 Investment Valuation 
 Investment transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market s participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. When market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Adviser believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instruments on the measurement date. 
 The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a variety of factors. To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Our valuation methodology is approved by the Board, and the Board is responsible for the fair values determined. As markets change, new types of investments are made, or pricing for certain investments becomes more or less observable, management, with oversight from the Board, may refine our valuation methodologies to best reflect the fair value of our investments appropriately. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented approximately 93.6 of our total assets, as compared to approximately 93.3 of our total assets as of December 31, 2021. 
 See Note 4. Investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our valuation process. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Set forth below is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. A discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from net cash proceeds from our ATM Program (described below) and contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations, including to fund our unfunded commitment obligations. 
 Cash Flows 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations, was 100.9 million, and net cash provided by financing activities was 101.0 million due primarily to the issuance of the 2027 Notes and proceeds received from our August 2022 public follow-on offering of common stock, offset by net repayments under the Credit Facility of 25.0 million and 49.6 million in distributions paid. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations, was 144.7 million, and net cash provided by financing activities was 159.1 million due primarily to the issuance of the 2026 Notes, and net borrowings under the Credit Facility of 82.0 million, partially offset by the redemption of the 2022 Notes and 45.6 million in distributions paid. As of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was 59.1 million. 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 As a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, including through our ATM Program (as described below) or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted. 
 Credit Facility 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of million and 200.0 million, respectively, excluding deferred credit facility costs of million and 2.2 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had million and 150.0 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 2022 Notes 
 
 On March 5, 2021, we notified the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes of our election to redeem, in full, the 74.75 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes outstanding, and instructed the trustee to provide notice of such redemption to the holders of the 2022 Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture. On April 5, 2021, the entire 74.75 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes was redeemed in full in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Notes. In connection with the redemption, the 2022 Notes were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The redemption was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which resulted in a realized loss of 0.7 million. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2022 Notes. 
 2025 Notes 
 
 67 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of million and 69.3 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes. 
 2026 Notes 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2026 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of million and 198.2 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2026 Notes. 
 2027 Notes 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2027 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of million. See Note 6. Borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2027 Notes. 
 ATM Program 
 On September 30, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with the Adviser, the Administrator and UBS Securities LLC (the Sales Agent ), providing for the issuance from time to time of up to an aggregate of 50.0 million in shares of our common stock by means of at-the-market offerings (the ATM Program ). Subject to the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Sales Agent is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Sales Agent s normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between us and the Sales Agent. 
 As of December 31, 2022, million in shares remained available for sale under the ATM Program. 
 Asset Coverage Requirements 
 On June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150 under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150 from 200 . Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2022, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was .

Unfunded Commitments 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our unfunded commitments totaled 324.0 million and 191.7 million, respectively, of which 88.9 million and 50.3 million, respectively, was dependent upon the portfolio companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them.

The following table shows additional information on our unfunded commitments regarding milestones and expirations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Unfunded Commitments (1) 
 (in thousands) 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Dependent on milestones 88,917 50,250 Expiring during: 2022 131,429 2023 224,053 50,233 2024 72,000 10,000 2025 27,957 Total 324,010 191,662 _______________ 
 (1) Does not include backlog of potential future commitments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our unfunded commitments to 37 companies totaled 324.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 43.8 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated. 
 As of December 31, 2021, our unfunded commitments to 22 companies totaled 191.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 91.8 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated. 
 Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50 - 75 of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods. 
 The fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the relevant counterparty s credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled 5.5 million and 3.2 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90 of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were subject to a 4 U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder s adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for the current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company s Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes. 
 72 

The following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to December 31, 2022. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2018 and 2017 distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately 0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our portfolio companies operations and our net investment income, any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder s election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20 of the aggregate declared distribution.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 ). ASU 2022-03 (1) clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2022-03 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 In January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) ASU 2021-01 ). ASU 2021-01 is an update of ASU 2020-04, which is in response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates, and particularly the risk of cessation of LIBOR; regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. ASU 2020-04 is elective and applies to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU 2021-01 update clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update are effective immediately through December 31, 2022, for all entities. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Distribution 
 On February 21, 2023, the Board declared a 0.40 per share regular quarterly distribution, representing an 8 increase over the prior quarter s 0.37 per share distribution and an 11 increase over the first quarter 2022 distribution. The first quarter 2023 distribution is payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2023. 
 Recent Portfolio Activity 
 From January 1, 2023 through February 28, 2023, we closed 3.7 million of additional debt commitments and funded 29.8 million in new investments. TPC s direct originations platform entered into 55.5 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC s allocation policy. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We are also subject to risks relating to the capital markets; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; conditions affecting the general economy; legislative reform; and local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability. U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have recently been experiencing an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and in values of publicly-traded securities. Any continuation of the stresses on capital markets and credit markets, or a further increase in volatility could result in a contraction of available credit for us and/or an inability by us to access the equity or debt capital markets or could otherwise cause an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings and in the relative values of our portfolio that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates or reference rates to the extent that any debt investments include floating interest rates. Debt investments are made with either floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest rates for the term of the investment or fixed interest rates. 
 A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over the Prime Rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. 
 74 

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 61.2 , or 545.1 million in principal balance, of the debt investments in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, which generally are Prime-based, and all of which have interest rate floors of 3.25 or higher. Substantially all of our unfunded commitments float with changes in the Prime Rate from the date we enter into the commitment to the date of the actual draw. In addition, our interest expense will be affected by changes in the interest rate in connection with our Credit Facility to the extent it goes above the interest rate floor; however, our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate (subject to a 1.00 increase in the fixed rate in the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement (as modified by the First Supplement with respect to the 2026 Notes and the Second Supplement with respect to the 2027 Notes)) occurs). 
 As of December 31, 2022, our floating rate borrowings totaled 175.0 million, which represented 30.7 of our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2022, all of our floating rate debt investments were subject to interest-rate floors set at 3.25 or higher. Because the Prime Rate as of December 31, 2022 was 7.50 , which is at or above the interest-rate floors applicable to our floating rate debt investments, decreases in interest rates will impact our interest income to a limited extent until Prime Rate reaches 3.25 , while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income to the extent that such rates exceed the applicable interest-rate floor. In addition, with respect to interest expense on our floating rate borrowings under the Credit Facility, we will benefit from any decreases in interest rates up to the point that the SOFR rate decreases to 0.50 , which is the SOFR interest-rate floor under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. However, because current interest rates exceed the SOFR interest-rate floor under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, our interest expense on floating rate borrowings will increase as rates rise. The following table illustrates the annual impact on our net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure from the December 31, 2022 consolidated statements of assets and liabilities: 
 Change in Interest Rates (in thousands) Increase (decrease) in interest income (Increase) decrease in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in net investment income Up 300 basis points 16,353 (5,250) 11,103 Up 200 basis points 10,902 (3,500) 7,402 Up 100 basis points 5,451 (1,750) 3,701 Up 50 basis points 2,726 (875) 1,851 Down 50 basis points (2,611) 875 (1,736) Down 100 basis points (5,214) 1,750 (3,464) Down 200 basis points (10,271) 3,500 (6,771) Down 300 basis points (15,011) 5,250 (9,761) 
 This analysis is indicative of the potential impact on our investment income as of December 31, 2022, assuming an immediate and sustained change in interest rates as noted. It should be noted that we anticipate growth in our portfolio funded in part with additional borrowings and such additional borrowings, all else being equal, will increase our investment income sensitivity to interest rates to the extent such borrowings have floating interest rates, and such changes could be material. In addition, this analysis does not adjust for potential changes in our portfolio or our borrowing facilities after December 31, 2022 nor does it take into account any changes in the credit performance of our loans that might occur should interest rates change. 
 Because it is our intention to hold loans to maturity, the fluctuating relative value of these loans that may occur due to changes in interest rates may have an impact on unrealized gains and losses during quarterly reporting periods. Based on our assessment of the interest rate risk, as of December 31, 2022, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We may also have exposure to foreign currencies related to certain investments. Such investments are translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate at the relevant balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in the exchange rate. Based on our assessment of the foreign currency exchange rate risk, as of December 31, 2022, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency forward contracts, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our portfolio investments. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation. Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements and Financial Highlights 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company ), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the consolidated financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and financial highlights, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, by correspondence with the custodian, loan agents, and borrowers; when replies were not received, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to an account or disclosure that is material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Fair Value Level 3 Investments Valuation Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company held investments classified as Level 3 investments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These investments include growth capital loans, revolving loans, and not publicly traded investments in venture growth stage companies. The valuation techniques which are used by management and approved by the valuation committee in estimating the fair value of these investments vary and certain significant inputs used were unobservable. Unobservable inputs are those for which market data are not available and that are developed using the most relevant information about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an investment. The fair value of the Company s Level 3 investments was 946.0 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 We identified the valuation of Level 3 investments as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management and the valuation committee to select valuation techniques and to use significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and extensive audit effort, including the need to involve fair value specialists who possess significant valuation experience, to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and the significant unobservable inputs, when performing audit procedures to audit management s estimate of fair value of Level 3 investments. 
 
 77 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of Level 3 investments included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation techniques used by management to estimate fair value and tested the related significant unobservable inputs by comparing these inputs to external sources. For a sample of Level 3 investments, we performed these procedures with the assistance of our fair value specialists. 
 In instances where the selection of valuation techniques or significant unobservable inputs involves more subjective judgments and estimates, with the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed an independent estimate of the fair value and compared our estimates to management s estimates. 
 We evaluated management s ability to reasonably estimate fair value by comparing management s historical estimates to subsequent transactions, taking into account changes in market or investment specific conditions, where applicable.

For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of its two most recently completed calendar quarters. Such amount is appropriately adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during a calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee, which provides the Adviser with a share of the income it generates for the Company, consists of two components net investment income and net capital gains which are largely independent of each other, and may result in one component being payable in a given period even if the other is not payable. 
 Under the investment income component, the Company pays the Adviser each quarter of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of annualized) of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which the Adviser receives all of such income in excess of but less than , subject to a total return requirement. The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter, the Adviser receives of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent that of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the hurdle, subject to the catch-up provision and (ii) (x) of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation since the effective date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. The Company elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act on March 5, 2014. 
 Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee, the Company pays the Adviser at the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement) 20.0 of the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of that year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement), computed net of aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the foregoing purpose, the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains does not include any unrealized gains. It should be noted that the Company accrues an incentive fee for accounting purposes taking into account any unrealized gains in accordance with GAAP. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee is payable for such year. Additionally, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management of the Company (with participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO Framework ). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Item 9B. Other Information 
 FEES AND EXPENSES 
 The following table is being provided to update, as of December 31, 2022, certain information in the Company s effective shelf registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-254802), declared effective by the SEC on May 26, 2021, as supplemented by any prospectus supplements relating to our ATM Program. The information is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any filing under the Securities Act into which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference, contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by you, us or the Company, or that we will pay fees or expenses, our stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in us. 
 (1) Offering expenses (as a percentage of offering price) (2) Dividend reinvestment plan expenses (3) Total Stockholder Transaction Expenses (as a percentage of offering price) Annual Expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock): Base management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement (4) Incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement (20 of net investment income and realized capital gains) (5) Interest payments on borrowed funds (6) Other expenses (7) Total annual expenses 
 __________ 
 (1) The maximum agent commission with respect to the shares of our common stock sold under the ATM Program is 2.00 . In the event that our securities are sold to or through underwriters or other agents, a corresponding prospectus or prospectus supplement will disclose the applicable sales load and other offering expenses to be borne by us and our stockholders. 
 (2) 
 (3) 
 (4) 
 (5) Assumes that annual incentive fees earned by our Adviser remain consistent with the incentive fees that would have been earned by our Adviser (if not for the cumulative catch-up provision explained below) for the year ended December 31, 2022 adjusted for any equity issuances. The incentive fee consists of two components, investment income and capital gains, which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not payable. Under the investment income component, we pay our Adviser each quarter 20.0 of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of 2.0 (which is 8.0 annualized) of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision pursuant to which our Adviser receives all of such income in excess of the 2.0 level but less than 2.5 and subject to a total return requirement. The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5 in any calendar quarter, our Adviser receives 20.0 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the 2.0 hurdle rate did not apply. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent that 20.0 of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. In other words, any investment income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0 of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0 hurdle rate, subject to the catch-up provision and (ii) (x) 20.0 of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since March 5, 2014 minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid since March 5, 2014. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation since March 5, 2014. Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee, we pay our Adviser at the end of each calendar year 20.0 of our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of that year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the foregoing purpose, our aggregate cumulative realized capital gains does not include any unrealized appreciation. It should be noted that we accrue an incentive fee for accounting purposes taking into account any unrealized appreciation in accordance with GAAP. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. 
 (6) Interest payments on borrowed funds represent our estimated annual interest payment, fees and credit facility expenses and are based on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, including with respect to the Credit Facility, the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes. The costs associated with any outstanding indebtedness are indirectly borne by our common stockholders. The amount of leverage we employ at any particular time will depend on, among other things, the Board and our Adviser s assessment of the market and other factors at the time at any proposed borrowing. We may also issue preferred stock, subject to our compliance with applicable requirements under the 1940 Act.

Example 
 You would pay the following expenses on a 1,000 investment, assuming a 5 annual return entirely from realized capital gains 
 __________________ 
 (1) Assumes no return from net realized capital gains or net unrealized capital appreciation. 
 While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5 annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5 . As noted, the example includes the realized capital gains fee from the Investment Advisory Agreement but does not include the income incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which, assuming a 5 annual return, would either not be payable or have an immaterial impact on the expense amounts shown above. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. 
 Further, while the example assumes reinvestment of all distributions at NAV, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to a participant by (a) 95 of the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the payment date fixed by the Board in the event that newly issued shares of our common stock are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, or (b) the average purchase price of all shares of common stock purchased by the plan administrator in the event that shares are purchased in the open market to implement the requirements of the dividend reinvestment plan, which may be at, above or below NAV. 
 This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.

RULE 14b-2 
 Custodian holds and registers securities in the name of a nominee. Therefore the identity of the Principals is not generally available to the corporation issuing the securities Company(ies) ). Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Rule 14b-2 facilitates direct communications between a Company and persons who have or share the right to vote or direct the voting Beneficial Owners of securities of a Company. 
 Pursuant to (B)(6) Principals reserve the right to vote securities held hereunder. 
 Therefore Principals are Beneficial Owners . 
 
 SEC Rule 14b-2 enables Companies to learn the names, addresses and security positions of Beneficial Owners of securities held by Custodian. Companies may only use this information to deliver proxies and certain other communications to the Beneficial Owners. Pursuant to Rule 14b-2 Custodian must provide the names, addresses and security positions of all Beneficial Owners to the Company unless a Beneficial Owner affirmatively objects to the disclosure. 
 Under Rule 14b-2 a Beneficial Owner's Objection to Disclosure applies to all securities held in this account. 
 By signing, below I we object to disclosure of personal information and security positions of the principal(s).
