 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Introduction We own and operate regional theme parks and water parks. We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world and the largest operator of water parks in North America based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 27 regional theme parks and water parks, 24 are located in the United States, two are located in Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. parks serve each of the top 10 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in Fall 2022. Our diversified portfolio of North American parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 145 million people and 250 million people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the U.S. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our parks and from the sale of food, beverages, merchandise and other products and services within our parks. Our parks occupy approximately 5,850 acres of land, and we own approximately 700 additional acres of land with development potential. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2022, our parks contained approximately 940 rides, including over 140 roller coasters, making us the leading provider of thrill rides in the industry. Developing new parks is resource intensive, given a limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, long development lead-time, and zoning restrictions. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would take a minimum of four years to plan and construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded parks. We own the internationally recognized Six Flags brand name in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 23 of our parks are branded as Six Flags or Hurricane Harbor parks, and we are working with a third party that is developing a Six Flags-branded theme park in Saudi Arabia. We license the right to use certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters at our theme parks, which provide an enhanced family entertainment experience and theming. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic had material effects on our business during the years ended January 2, 2022, and December 31, 2020, through the temporary suspension of operations at our parks. During the year ended January 2, 2022, our parks in California and Mexico had fewer operating days than planned due to COVID-19 related closures. All of our parks were closed for at least a portion of 2020. COVID-19 and its variants continue to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance and financial results, including our ability to keep all of our parks open to our guests. We will continue to consider near-term exigencies and the long-term financial health of the business as we take steps to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including any additional actions we have taken, or will take, to minimize the spread of COVID-19 and its variants or manage its impact.

 Fiscal Calendar Change Holdings Board of Directors of determined that it is in our best interest to change the method of determining our fiscal quarters and fiscal years, such that each fiscal quarter will consist of thirteen weeks ending on a Sunday and each fiscal year will consist of 52 or 53 weeks, as applicable, and will end on the Sunday closest to December 31, effective as of the commencement of our fiscal year on January 1, 2021. This change was made to align our fiscal reporting calendar with how we operate our business and improve comparability across periods. This Annual Report covers the period January 3, 2022, through January 1, 2023 the year ended January 1, 2023 or 2022 ). The comparison period in the prior year covers January 1, 2021, through January 2, 2022 the year ended January 2, 2022 or 2021 ). The year ended January 2, 2022, contained three extra days due to the calendar change from calendar year reporting. The year ended December 31, 2020, covers the period between January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020 the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2020 ). Strategic Plan In December 2021, we made changes to our organizational structure, including to our leadership team, by reducing layers of management to more effectively align resources to business priorities and empower our park employees. We believe that the Company s success will be realized through the engagement and empowerment of our employees. We are focused on developing a dynamic, performance-driven culture centered on the guest and fostering a spirit of innovation, which has always been at our core. Under our new leadership, our strategy is focused on delivering long-term, profitable growth by continuously enhancing the guest experience and by operating efficiently. In particular, we are focusing our efforts on four pillars: Upgrading all aspects of our parks and experiences for our guests and our employees; Adjusting our pricing and product architecture to strategically optimize attendance; Amplifying new and evolving seasonal events in our parks; and Developing a park-centric culture of agility, autonomy, urgency and performance. As we execute on our strategy, our approach to capital allocation focuses on reinvesting in the business and decreasing financial leverage. We are also committed to working more efficiently and being disciplined with costs. Description of Parks and Segment Information Our parks provide similar products and services through a similar process to the same class of customer through a consistent method. We also believe our parks share common economic characteristics. Based on these factors, we have only one reportable segment theme parks. The following chart summarizes key business and geographical information about our parks.

 Partnership Park Arrangements In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation Former SFEC , a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that had always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks and water parks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years. In connection with this acquisition, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to Six Flags Over Texas SFOT and Six Flags Over Georgia, including Six Flags White Water Atlanta SFOG , and together with SFOT, the Partnership Parks ). These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately 85.6 million in 2023 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners of the Partnership Parks (based on our ownership of units as of January 1, 2023, our share of such distribution will be approximately 38.1 million) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6 of Partnership Park revenues. Given recent increases in consumer price index, for 2023, we will pay approximately 5 million more in minimum distributions to the limited partners than in 2022. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the Partnership Park Put ). After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3 of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, then repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans, with any additional cash being distributed 95 to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5 to us, in the case of SFOT. The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the Specified Price that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park s weighted average four year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (8.0 in the case of SFOG and 8.5 in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. In light of the temporary suspension of operations of the Partnership Parks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which would cause the value of the limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks to decrease in 2021 and thereafter, we adjusted our annual offer to purchase these units. Accordingly, to preserve liquidity in 2020 and avoid uncertainty with future purchase prices for the units, we adjusted the 2020 offer price to set a minimum price floor for all future purchases. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of January 1, 2023, is 409.7 million in the case of SFOG, and 527.4 million in the case of SFOT. As of January 1, 2023, we owned approximately 31.5 and 54.1 of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 68.5 and 45.9 of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately 521.4 million. Pursuant to the 2022 annual offer, we did not purchase units from the Georgia partnership. We purchased 0.25358 units from the Texas partnership for approximately 0.6 million in May 2022. The 350 million accordion feature on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B (as defined in Note 8, Long-Term Indebtedness , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future put obligations if necessary. In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company s entities, Time Warner, and an affiliate of Time Warner (an indirect subsidiary of AT T Inc. as a result of a merger in 2018), pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations that own the entities that purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities at the end of the term, which is 2027 for SFOG and 2028 for SFOT.

 Warner to Discovery did not affect the Time Warner guarantee of our obligations under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. We incurred 20.6 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2022 season, and intend to incur at least the minimum required expenditure in 2023. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships generated approximately 73.0 million of cash in 2022 in operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings, as the case may be. As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, we had total loans receivable outstanding of 288.3 million from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners. Marketing and Promotion We attract visitors through multichannel marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name. They are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. Marketing and promotional programs are updated or replaced each year to address new developments. We also seek to develop long-term corporate sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known regional and national brands that align with our values and strategy. This allows us to develop strategic alliances with mutually beneficial advertising programs. During the year ended January 1, 2023, we had two primary pass products. Our season pass products offers unlimited visits to a specified park whenever it is open and is valid for one operating season or such other date stated in the pass product. Our legacy membership program offers unlimited visits to most of our parks and automatically renews monthly after a one-year commitment period. The program was discontinued during 2022, however, existing members can continue to renew monthly until cancellation or default. Season pass and membership sales represent advance purchase commitments that reduce exposure to inclement weather and economic downturns. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single-day guest. A season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate word-of-mouth advertising for the parks. Single-day guests tend to spend more per visit. We will continue to strive for a balanced mix of guests to maximize revenue. Season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 54 and 63 of total attendance at our parks in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to offer primarily season passes and single day tickets during 2023, while continuing to honor our legacy membership program. Our Group Sales team organizes events and outings for various groups at our parks, including customized catering, coordination of tickets and event planning. We use limited promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, digital and social marketing activities, search engine marketing, radio and television advertising, direct mail, and sponsorship marketing. The special promotional offers are usually available for a limited time and provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket.

 Licenses We hold exclusive long-term licenses of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters at our theme parks throughout the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker , Superman, Wonder Woman , The Flash, Green Lantern, Harley Quinn, Aquaman , Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam . The licenses include the right to sell merchandise using the characters and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on any merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that use the licensed characters. Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. Park Operations We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. Each park is managed by a park president or general manager who is responsible for all operations and management of the individual park. Each park president or general manager directs a full-time, on-site management team. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams. Each park has senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance; in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games; marketing and sales; public safety and risk management; human resources and finance. Park management compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenue and free cash flow. Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events such as Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park . Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Six Flags Magic Mountain operates on most days year-round, and our parks in Mexico, Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags Over Texas operate weekends year-round outside of their traditional operating season. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price that allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions require the payment of an additional fee. See Note 17, Business Segments , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories. Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives We regularly make capital investments for new rides and attractions in our parks. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. On occasion, we also relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. In addition, each year we make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase guest spending per capita. We also make annual enhancements to theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience and invest in our information technology infrastructure to attain operational efficiencies. We regularly perform maintenance capital enhancements, with most expenditures made during the off-season. Repairs and maintenance costs for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures. Our capital plan will continue to selectively add new coasters over time to our exceptional portfolio of thrill rides; however, our near-term focus will be a balanced approach between exciting new rides and an increased focus on implementing guest-facing technology, food service equipment, amenities, infrastructure improvements, events and festivals in our parks, as well as enhancing the overall experience in our water parks.

 During 2023, we plan to enhance our targeted marketing strategies to attract new-to-brand consumers and convert them to loyal guests, by (i) elevating our overall guest experience and focusing on our breadth of product in our theme parks and water parks; (ii) simplifying our admissions product offerings (iii) developing guest-focused in-park initiatives to drive guest spending growth; (iv) taking a balanced approach to single day ticket and season pass sales; and (v) growing group sales and sponsorship revenue opportunities back to pre-pandemic levels or higher. International Agreements We are working with a third party that is developing a Six Flags-branded park in Saudi Arabia. As compensation for exclusivity, brand licensing rights, and design, development and management services, we receive fees during the design and development period as well as ongoing remuneration after the park opens to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the park. We plan to focus on our core business over the next two to three years; during this time, we will be cautious about expanding into adjacent domestic markets or entering into new international agreements. Maintenance and Inspection Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park s operations, potential risks to employees and staff as well as to the public. In addition, contingency response plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them when necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. A large portion of our full-time workforce devotes substantially all of its time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We use a computerized maintenance-management system across all of our domestic parks to assist us in executing our maintenance programs. In addition to the performance of our internal maintenance and inspection procedures, we, or our insurance carriers, as the case may be, retain third party consultants to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports and include suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors conduct additional annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis Associates as water safety consultants at all of our water parks to train lifeguards and audit safety procedures. Insurance We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable and are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to 100.0 million per occurrence. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is 2.0 million, followed by a 0.5 million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our retention contingencies. For workers compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is 0.75 million. We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of 10.0 million with a 0.25 million retention per event.

 We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2023. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks. Competition Our parks compete with other theme parks, water parks, amusement parks, as well as with other types of recreational facilities and forms of out-of-home entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, restaurants and vacation travel. Competitors of our parks include SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.; Cedar Fair, L.P.; NBCUniversal/Universal Parks Resorts; Disney Parks; Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation; Hershey Entertainment Resorts Company; Merlin Entertainment Ltd.; Palace Entertainment; Premier Parks, LLC; Boomers Parks and a number of other regional and local competitors in the geographies in which we operate. In addition, our business is subject to various factors affecting the recreation and leisure industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Within each park s regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in the park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, the quality of park food and entertainment, and ease of travel to the park. Our theme parks have several advantages over other forms of entertainment. We believe that our parks offer a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, culinary offerings, retail locations, and interactive and family experiences to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment. They are outdoor venues spread over hundreds of acres, making them naturally conducive to social distancing. They are open many hours throughout the day, reducing the need for guests to arrive or leave at the same time. Finally, the vast majority of our guests live within a day s drive, so a visit to one of our parks does not require air travel or a stay at a hotel. Seasonality Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 70 of park attendance and revenues in a typical year occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Environmental and Other Regulations Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park and water park operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future. Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition.

 Environmental, Social and Governance We are committed to advancing a purpose-led vision and fostering a culture that encourages our employees to enhance our business and the communities in which we operate. We endeavor to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices that create sustainable economic value to our employees, stockholders, communities, and other stakeholders. Our dedicated environmental and community stewardship is an integral component of our delivering excellence, driving strategic innovation, and growing long-term stockholder value. We believe that our impact on the environment, how we manage our relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where we operate, and the accountability of our leadership to our stockholders are all critically important to our business. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to further these goals, including establishment of a diversity and inclusion council, implementation of a human rights policy and continued collaboration with local communities to support COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. With respect to environmental initiatives, we place a high priority on energy management, water conservation, and waste reduction. We are enhancing our water reclamation initiatives and continue to prioritize recyclable or biodegradable products in both our operations and our supply chain. We also continue to seek to incorporate solar power into our operations and otherwise reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With respect to governance issues, we are dedicated to meeting the highest standards of business conduct through our commitments to fostering quality and integrity in our own operations, and we expect our vendors to uphold the same standards of responsible business practices as set forth in our vendor code of conduct. Human Capital Our vision to be the preferred regional destination for entertainment would not be possible without our employees, who are the cornerstone of our commitment to provide the best customer experience for our guests. We aim to create a culture that is results-oriented and supports our values of safety, integrity, accountability, guest-centricity, innovation, teamwork, inclusiveness, and fun. Core to achieving this goal is our commitment to conducting business in a manner that respects all individuals and promotes human rights, including providing fair working conditions and competitive wages, as set forth in our Human Rights Policy. We believe that the Company s success will be realized through the engagement and empowerment of our employees. We are focused on developing a dynamic performance-driven culture centered on the guest and creating a spirit of innovation, which has always been at our core. Employees As of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 1,450 full-time employees, and over the course of the 2022 operating season we employed approximately 40,000 seasonal employees. We compete with other local employers for qualified candidates on a season-by-season basis. As part of the seasonal employment program, we employ a significant number of teenagers, which subjects us to child labor laws. Approximately 20 of our domestic full-time and approximately 7 of our domestic seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. Approximately 4 of our international full-time and approximately 46 of our international seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. These labor agreements expire in January 2024 (Six Flags Over Texas), December 2024 (Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Magic Mountain), and January 2025 (Six Flags St. Louis). The labor agreements for La Ronde expire in various years ranging from December 2022 through December 2024. With respect to the La Ronde agreement that expired in December 2022, active discussions with the unions are currently underway. The labor agreements for Six Flags Great Adventure expire in various years ranging from December 2023 through December 2026. We consider our employee relations to be good.

 During the year ended January 1, 2023, we reduced full-time employee headcount by 520 from our total as of January 2, 2022. The reduction in full-time employees was done to right-size our organization for intentionally lower attendance levels and to create a more streamlined and efficient organization by reducing layers of management and empowering our workers. Diversity and Inclusion We understand that enhancing our financial strength and improving our guest s experience requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that fully embraces the diversity of our employees and guests, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, disability, cultural background, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. We maintain a Diversity and Inclusion Council that provides feedback on a wide variety of diversity and inclusion related issues. In that regard, we are focused on the following: 

Listen to employees and other stakeholders about how we can become more diverse and inclusive through our Diversity and Inclusion Council, and through regular employee surveys, which provide feedback directly to senior management, including the CEO Train leaders on how to embrace inclusion, create awareness, understanding and recognize explicit and implicit bias including by providing instruction on how to lead open and honest conversations with employees Address Unconscious Biases by updating our grooming, social media, and hiring policies, and changing any ride or attraction names that could be viewed as offensive Build a Diverse Team with a leadership team that represents the diversity of our workplace and marketplace and through updating recruiting, people planning, and talent management programs to foster more objective processes for all employees Partner with Communities by proactively working with diversity driven suppliers to develop long-term alliances. As of January 1, 2023, approximately 50 of our full-time management employees, defined as those holding the title of manager or higher, were diverse by ethnicity and/or gender. Of the group, 33 are female and approximately 28 are ethnically diverse. By fostering an inclusive culture, we enable every employee to leverage unique talents and high-performance standards to drive innovation and success. Employee Development We seek to continuously elevate employee development and training through a variety of programs, opportunities, and resources. We continue to partner with the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards to provide our guest-facing employees with specialized training to earn a Certificate in Autism Competency to further our commitment to better serve the special needs community, provide a more inclusive environment in our parks and continue our efforts in educating our employees on diversity and inclusion. We continue to enhance our talent development program by providing our employees with access to training, including virtual classrooms and online courses on topics including general safety, Office 365, harassment, discrimination, business ethics, anti-corruption, privacy and security, and park safety. We continue to redefine our succession planning process by establishing programs to better support the development of our talent bench for roles in management, maintenance and operations. Our senior leadership team reviews our talent development program annually with a particular focus on our top 10 of high performing, high potential talent, including a focus on diversity. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our future leaders. In 2022 we launched an educational platform called Workforce Edge that provides educational opportunities to all of our employees. These educational opportunities include degrees, certification, licensing, and leadership opportunities.

 Employee Engagement and Recruitment We understand that continuous engagement with our employees is vital to driving successful, meaningful outcomes. Senior management conducts town-hall style meetings with employees to address topics such as business operations, strategy, market conditions, and question-and-answer sessions, to foster an environment and corporate culture of transparency and collaboration. We conduct ongoing employee satisfaction surveys that provide actionable feedback from employees to management. The survey responses are anonymous and measure employee satisfaction and solicit honest feedback. Management from both corporate and the parks meet routinely to review the survey results and develop action plans in response to the employee feedback. We are focused on attracting, developing, and retaining best-in-class diverse teams, and continuing to build an inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking, empowers expeditious decision-making, and ties to our values. These guiding principles have been more important than ever in light of the unique challenges of operating during the ongoing pandemic. We source candidates from various sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with high schools, trade schools, universities, professional associations and industry partners to proactively attract new talent. Our recruiting practices and candidate selection are among our most important activities. We prioritized filling open positions with quality employees who want to advance the Six Flags mission. In addition, we utilize social media, virtual job fairs and organizations across the United States to find diverse, enthusiastic and qualified employees. Competitive Benefits Attracting, motivating, developing and retaining the best people is crucial to all aspects of our business and long-term success, and is central to our mission, vision and values. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, motivate and retain employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs includes incentives based on both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically: We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs. We align our executives long-term equity compensation with our stockholders interests by linking a significant portion of total compensation opportunity to business performance. All full-time employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, and life and disability/accident coverage, unless otherwise specified by a union contract. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including telemedicine, paid parental leave, prescription savings solutions, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance, identity theft insurance, pet insurance and a wellness program. A unique Six Flags perquisite offers full-time employees complimentary passes, including for their dependents, which provides free admission to any of our parks, preferred parking and discounts on in-park products. Full-time employees are also provided complimentary tickets. 
 Safety The health and safety of our guests and employees is our highest priority. It is the shared responsibility of every employee to actively participate in creating a safe and secure environment and to minimize injuries. The hallmarks of the Company s safety and security programs are:

Table of Contents 
 Resources and education to ensure safe and secure operating environments at the parks, including compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, as well as to improve overall workplace safety and health. This includes regular and ongoing safety training and assessments as well as annual safety audits. A highly trained workforce that proactively assesses risks, strives to eliminate unsafe conditions, and integrates learning from incidents to prevent future occurrences. Dedicated leadership, accountability, and employee empowerment. We expanded remote work opportunities where possible and implemented extensive health and safety measures, such as enhanced sanitization protocols and distribution of personal protective equipment, to provide a safe working environment for our employees. We continue to regularly monitor guidance from federal and local health authorities in evaluating applicable COVID-19 health and safety protocols with regard to ongoing operations. We enhanced our operations to make it safer and easier for our employees to come to work including adding training to ensure compliance with applicable health and safety protocols, contactless recruiting and hiring procedures, and offering voluntary on-site COVID testing and vaccination opportunities. We received favorable responses from our employees on our safety measures as evidenced by our employee satisfaction scores. We continue to offer guests the ability to obtain cash cards from kiosks throughout the parks to facilitate electronic transactions as an option in lieu of using cash, and implemented mobile food ordering at all of our domestic parks. These innovations added contactless means to enhance our guests experience through faster, more convenient transactions while elevating our enhanced safety guidelines. Human Rights Our attention to health and safety of our guests and employees extends to the workers and communities in the supply chain. We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to our mission of creating fun and thrilling memories for all and our commitment to ethical business conduct. We adopted a human rights policy that is grounded in international standards and is an important expression of our values. The policy provides the framework to hold employees accountable to advance, support and respect human rights in the course of doing business. We are focused on screening and doing business with vendors and suppliers who conduct their business with ethical standards that are consistent with our policy and the Company s code of vendor conduct.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below are the principal risks that we believe are most significant to our business and should be considered by our security holders. We operate in a continually changing business environment and, therefore, new risks emerge from time to time. This section contains forward-looking statements. For an explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements, see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Risks Relating to Our Business General economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), and credit market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors. A general economic slowdown or recession resulting in a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit our parks and the amount that our guests spend when they visit. Additionally, difficult economic conditions throughout the world, including global supply chain issues, could impact our ability to obtain supplies, services and credit as well as the ability of third parties to meet their obligations to us, including, for example, manufacturers ability to supply rides, payment of claims by our insurance carriers, funding of our lines of credit, or payment by our international agreement partner. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies could reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor and supply costs in non-U.S. markets or reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we earn in other markets. The demand for our parks, other entertainment and recreation activities generally, and discretionary travel is highly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary consumer spending. Any actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in general, regional or local economic conditions, unemployment levels, the job or housing markets, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, as well as other adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID-19 or otherwise, may reduce our customers discretionary income to spend on parks, entertainment, recreation activities and travel. Our growth strategy and strategic plan may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success depends on our ability to grow and evolve our business, including through capital investments to improve existing parks, rides, attractions and other entertainment offerings, technological advancements and improvements to enhance the guest experience and to increase productivity, as well as through our food and beverage and retail offerings. Our strategies may not enhance guest experiences or increase productivity as planned, may not increase our revenues at the rate we expect or at all, and may require the expenditure of capital resources or operating costs in excess of what we originally budgeted and allocated for such purposes. In addition, our increased focus on improving our food and beverage offerings and simplifying our admissions products may not be successful. If we are unable to achieve our strategic objectives and grow and evolve our business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

 Bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which may be due to climate change, can adversely impact attendance at our parks. Because most of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions that may be a result of climate change, which negatively affects our revenues. The effects of bad weather on attendance can be more pronounced at our water parks. We believe our operating results in certain years were adversely affected by abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather in a number of our major U.S. markets. In addition, since a number of our parks are geographically concentrated in the eastern portion of the United States, a weather pattern that affects that area could adversely affect a number of our parks and disproportionately impact our results of operations. In addition, our parks in California and Texas are more likely to be impacted by extreme heat, wildfires, mudslides and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, than our parks in other locations. Bad weather and forecasts of bad weather on weekends, holidays or other peak periods will typically have a greater negative impact on our revenues and could disproportionately impact our results of operations. Conditions beyond our control could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance at our parks and result in decreased revenues. Natural disasters, public heath crises, epidemics, pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, terrorist activities, power outages or other events outside our control could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce attendance at our parks or require temporary park closures. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes or hurricanes may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause attendance at our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example, our water park in Oaxtepec, Mexico was closed for several months during 2017 following the earthquakes in central Mexico. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since some of our parks are near major urban areas and appeal to teenagers and young adults, there may be disturbances at one or more parks that could negatively affect our reputation or brand. This may result in a decrease in attendance at the affected parks and could adversely impact our results of operations. While we work with local law enforcement authorities on security-related precautions to prevent certain types of disturbances, we can make no assurance that these precautions will be able to prevent or mitigate these types of events. We cannot predict the frequency, duration or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations. Since early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our business especially when we were required to temporarily suspend operations at our theme parks and water parks in March 2020. As of January 1, 2023, we expect all of our parks to open in accordance with their normal operating schedules. The impacts of COVID-19 on our business will continue for an unknown length of time. Future developments relating to COVID-19, including severity, rate of transmission, variants, treatment, testing and vaccinations, are uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally , COVID-19 impacts that have subsided (such as temporary park closures, operating at reduced capacity and requiring advanced reservations) may again impact our business in the future and new impacts may emerge from COVID-19 developments or other pandemics. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19, including the fixed costs of operating our business and the impact COVID-19 may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.

 The impact of any future outbreak of any COVID-19 variants or any other highly infectious or contagious disease is unpredictable and could result in restrictions from governmental authorities. Additionally, we may impose our own COVID-19 related restrictions in addition to what is required by state and local governments in the interest of safety for our guests and employees. Any of these measures could further disrupt our operations, or have a negative impact on our financial results. If future developments require subsequent disruptive measures to be implemented, such as prolonged park closures, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. T he COVID-19 pandemic could have longer-term impacts on consumer tastes and preferences and could shift consumer entertainment and recreation behaviors toward digital entertainment experiences and other off-premises experiences and technologies. As a result, attendance, revenue and per capita spending at our theme parks and water parks could be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition, and prospects. The extent and duration of the impact of the ongoing endemic on our operations, financial performance and condition, liquidity and cash flows, will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any variants that may be highly contagious and/or impact the effectiveness of vaccines , vaccination rates in the communities in which we operate, any continuing or newly imposed travel restrictions or vaccination requirements in connection with travel, and the related impact on factors affecting guest behavior, including individuals risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward, consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our operations are seasonal. Our operations are seasonal. In a typical year, approximately 70 of our annual park attendance and revenue occurs during the second and third calendar quarters of each year. As a result, when conditions or events described in the above risk factors occur during the operating season, particularly during the peak months of July and August, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. In addition, most of our maintenance and capital expenses are incurred in the off-season. For this reason, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or of how we will perform in the future. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our parks, our employees or regulators. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings is determined adversely to us, or if we receive a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money, or injunctive relief is issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Litigation can also be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including to our management due to the increased time and resources required to respond to and address the litigation. Additionally, from time to time, animal activist and other third party groups may make negative public statements about us or bring claims before government agencies or lawsuits against us. Such claims and lawsuits sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our featured animals. On other occasions, such claims and/or lawsuits are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves in any lawsuits, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us. An unfavorable outcome in any legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, associated negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

 Failures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites and difficulties in updating our systems or software or implementing new systems or software could adversely affect our business or operations. We rely extensively on our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to sell tickets and admit guests to our parks, to sell food, beverages and other products in our parks, to manage our workforce, to manage our inventory, and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees, business partners and customers. These technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to damage or disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire, natural disasters, power outages, system and equipment failures, viruses, malicious attacks, security breaches, theft, and inadvertent release of information. Damage or disruption to these technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer disruptions in our operations as a result. We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions. In particular, our ticket, season pass and membership sales system relies on data communications networks and technology systems and software operated by third parties. The success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. If we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected. Further, as we implement our strategy to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and upgrading our information technologies. P otential problems and disruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including guests personal information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the Company and our business. We have experienced and continue to experience cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, including cyber-attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks , which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. Further, implementing our strategy to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure will result in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Failure to adequately assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives would increase our vulnerability to such risks. Due to the increased remote workforce, we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control. These systems are potentially vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and security breaches. In addition, cyber criminals are increasing their attacks on individual employees, utilizing interest in pandemic-related information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds, or steal credentials that compromise information systems. Even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. We have, and require, certain of our third party service providers to have, programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. However, t he actions and controls we 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 have implemented and continue to implement, or which we seek to cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, may be insufficient to protect our systems, information or other intellectual property. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or interfere with systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems has continued to increase in recent years. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause customers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us. Such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business. To date, these cybersecurity threats have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack on us or our third party service providers include business disruption; disruption to systems; theft, destruction, loss, corruption, misappropriation or unauthorized release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property (including personal information in violation of one or more privacy laws); reputational and brand damage; and potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition by governmental authorities of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which, in turn, could cause us to incur significantly increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs and the loss of customers. Failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position. The theme park and water park industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for operation of our parks, ticket, membership and season pass sales and management, and labor and inventory management. Information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies and systems in a timely and efficient manner. The development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from such new developments or upgrades. There is a risk of accidents occurring at our parks or competing parks which may reduce attendance and negatively impact our operations. Our brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our parks, services and rides, and our corporate and management integrity. While we carefully maintain the safety of our rides, there are inherent risks involved with these attractions. An accident or an injury (including water- or air-borne illnesses) at any of our parks or at parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our parks, and negatively impact our results of operations. For example, in September 2019, a coaster accident at La Feria, a competing park in Mexico, resulted in two fatalities. We believe that the publicity surrounding this accident had a significant negative impact on attendance at our park in Mexico during that period. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year. Increases in labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees in order to meet our guests high expectations for service. Wage and benefit increases to attract and retain employees in a tight labor market have driven-up labor costs. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. Our results of operations are also substantially affected by costs of retirement, including 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. In addition, we may experience material increase in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased minimum wage requirements, seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that the recent increases to the minimum wage rates will increase our salary, wage and benefit expenses in 2023 and future years and further legislative changes or competitive wage rates could continue to increase these expenses in the future. Additionally, we contribute to multiple defined benefit multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our collectively bargained employees of Six Flags Great Adventure LLC. If we were to cease contributing to or otherwise incur a withdrawal from any such plans, we could be obligated to pay withdrawal liability assessments based on the underfunded status (if any) of such plans at the time of the withdrawal. The amount of any multiemployer pension plan underfunding can fluctuate from year to year, and thus there is a possibility that the amount of withdrawal liability that we could incur in the future could be material, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. We depend on a seasonal workforce to meet our operational needs. Our park operations depend in part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees, many of whom are seasonal employees. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons. If we are unable to hire sufficient personnel or successfully manage our seasonal workforce needs, we may not be able to meet our operational needs and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The theme park and water park industry competes with numerous entertainment alternatives and such competition may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our parks compete with other theme parks, water parks and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sporting events, restaurants and vacation travel. Our business is also subject to factors that affect the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions, including relative fuel prices, and changes in consumer spending habits. The principal competitive factors of a park include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park and the quality of its food and entertainment. If we are unable to compete effectively against entertainment alternatives or on the basis of principal competitive factors of the park, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products. The success of our parks depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can change in often unpredictable ways and on our ability to ensure that our parks meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. We conduct research and analysis before acquiring new parks or opening new rides or attractions and often invest substantial amounts before we learn the extent to which these new parks and new rides or attractions will earn consumer acceptance. If visitor volumes at our parks were to decline significantly or if new rides and entertainment offerings at our parks do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, revenues and margins may decline. Our results of operations may also be adversely affected if we fail to retain long-term customer loyalty or provide satisfactory customer service. Data privacy regulation and our ability to comply could harm our business. We are subject to laws that regulate the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of our customer s data. Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, such as California s Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA that became effective January 1, 2020, which provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make certain disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Compliance with the CCPA, and other current and future applicable privacy and related laws can be costly and time-consuming, and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant damages and penalties. These laws continue to evolve in ways we cannot predict, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions, and that may harm our business. Our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data are available on our website. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, including the CCPA, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured. The majority of our current insurance policies have annual terms and expire on December 31, 2023, and we cannot guarantee we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme or water park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or we become subject to damages that cannot by law be insured against, such as punitive damages or certain intentional misconduct by our employees, this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to fund capital expenditures and invest in future attractions and projects in our parks, our revenues could be negatively impacted. Because a principal competitive factor for a theme park or a water park is the uniqueness and perceived quality of its rides and attractions, we need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. A key element for our revenue growth is strategic capital spending on such investments. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot provide assurance our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. In addition, any construction delays or ride downtime can adversely affect our attendance and our ability to realize revenue growth.

 Incidents involving food contamination, product recalls, product liability claims and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition. The sale of food, toys and other retail products involves legal and other risks. While we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable customers to enjoy safe, quality food products, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) could occur in our parks. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues could negatively affect our sales and reputation and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages. We may need to recall food products if they become contaminated, and we may need to recall toys, games or other retail merchandise if there is a design or product defect. Even though we are resellers of food, toys and other retail products, we may be liable if the consumption or purchase of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. A recall could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant food or retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence in our parks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to manufacture theme park or water park rides and attractions. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. Global supply chain issues may also cause delays in the receipt of required goods or services. In addition, if our third party suppliers financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We may not be able to realize the benefits of our international agreements. Various external factors, including difficult economic and political conditions throughout the world, could negatively affect the progress of our initiatives to develop new Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America. These initiatives could be delayed, and the ultimate success of such parks may be uncertain. For example, on February 14, 2020, we terminated our agreements with our partner in China to build parks as a result of its uncured payment defaults. Some factors that will be important to the success of our international agreement initiatives are different than those affecting our existing parks. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in new international markets into which we expand our brand may not embrace the parks offerings to the same extent as consumers in our existing markets. International agreements are also subject to additional risks, including the performance of our partners and their ability to obtain financing and government approvals; the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the U.S.; difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences; changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions; the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls, and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. If we do not realize the benefits of such transactions, it could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. We may not be able to renew our leases on terms acceptable to us or at all and our leases contain default provisions that, if enforced or exercised by the landlord, could significantly impact our operations at those parks. Of our 27 theme parks and water parks, 12 are located on property that we lease and do not own. While most of our leases have at least five years remaining on their terms, and in some cases with renewal options, our lease for our theme park in Mexico expires in 2024. We intend to renew the lease, but we cannot guarantee that the lease will be renewed on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our leases permit the landlord to terminate the lease if there is a default under the lease, including, for example, our failure to pay rent, utilities and applicable taxes in a timely fashion or to maintain certain insurance. If we could not renew a lease or a landlord were to terminate a lease, it would 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 halt our operations at that park and, depending on the size of the park, could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any disputes that may result from such a non-renewal or termination may be expensive to pursue and may divert money and management s attention from our other operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability or material increase in the cost to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and domain names and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breach of any contractual obligations to us, or independent development of intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. In addition, pursuant to our license agreements, we have exclusive theme park usage rights in the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada and Mexico to certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters. The license fee is subject to periodic scheduled adjustments and CPI increases, and Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances, such as a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. The termination of these licenses, or a material increase in the cost to retain these licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. As of January 1, 2023, approximately 20 of our domestic full-time and approximately 7 of our domestic seasonal employees were subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. Approximately 4 of our international full-time and 46 of our international seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. We have collective bargaining agreements in place for certain employees at Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags St. Louis, and La Ronde. New unionization activity or a labor dispute involving our employees could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of unionization activities or labor disputes could increase our costs. Litigation relating to employment and/or wage and hour disputes could also increase our operating expenses. Such disrupted operations, reduced revenues or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental, health and safety, climate change, and other regulations, which create uncertainty regarding future expenditures and liabilities. Our operations involve wastewater and stormwater discharges and air emissions, and as a result are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. These requirements are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states and localities where our parks are located (and can also often be enforced through citizen suit provisions) and include the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. Our operations also involve maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks, and managing and disposing of hazardous substances, chemicals and materials and are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these substances, chemicals and materials, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ). A portion of our capital expenditures budget is intended to ensure continued compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. In the event of contamination or injury as a result of a release of or exposure to regulated materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages. For example, pursuant to CERCLA, past and current owners and operators of facilities and persons arranging for disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for costs to remediate releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property. Our activities may be affected by new legislation or changes in existing environmental, health and safety laws. For example, the state or federal government having jurisdiction over a given area may enact legislation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or applicable state entity may propose new regulations or change existing regulations that could require our parks to reduce certain emissions or discharges. Such action could require our parks to install costly equipment or increase operating expenses. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements. Concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Increased costs of energy or compliance with emissions standards due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with park services. We also are subject to federal and state laws, which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Common Stock A portion of our cash flow is required to be used to fund our substantial monetary obligations. We have significant financial obligations under our debt instruments and the Partnership Park arrangements. See the Partnership Parks section in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a detailed discussion of our obligations with respect to the Partnership Parks. In the event of a default by us under the Partnership Parks arrangements, Time Warner has the right to take control of the Partnership Parks. In addition, such a default could trigger an event of default under the Credit Agreement. See Business Partnership Park Arrangements for additional information. If we are unable to make payments on our debt or satisfy our other obligations, or if we fail to obtain future financing that may be necessary for working capital, capital expenditures, payment of debt, or the Partnership Park obligations, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We plan to strategically reinvest in our properties to improve the guest experience and our business plan includes targeted annual capital spending. However, depending on various factors including strategic initiatives, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, unanticipated delays in the completion of our projects, weather conditions, increased labor

 costs, and availability and cost of ride components, we may spend more or less than our planned target amount. In 2022, we spent 111.5 million on capital expenditures, net of property insurance recoveries. We cannot be sure that cash generated from our parks will be as high as we expect or that our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flows are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by attendance levels, in-park sales, accommodations and sponsorship and international agreement activity. A lower amount of cash generated from our parks or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations. Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of January 1, 2023, our total indebtedness was approximately 2.381 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or repurchases of Holdings common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay strategic initiatives and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B are calculated on a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR plus an additional percentage based on credit risk. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. At the end of 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR, ceased publishing one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rate. The consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the interest payments under our debt. We will begin using SOFR or an alternative rate following the discontinuation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023. Changes in market interest rates may influence our future financing costs and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.

 The stock price of Holdings common stock may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of Holdings common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result . The trading price of Holdings common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of Holdings common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) o ur operating and financial performance; (ii) our ability to repay our debt; (iii) our ability to refinance our debt; (iv) investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; (v) our dividend policy; (vi) changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts; and (viii) general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions. In addition, our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that, when possible, it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of EBITDA and other financial metrics or projections from time to time. We do not have any responsibility to provide guidance or to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these stated goals when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. We periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases. In 2020, pursuant to amendments to the Credit Agreement, we suspended our quarterly dividend payment and stock repurchase program due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic until the earlier December 31, 2022, or such time as Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. SFTP reduces the incremental revolving credit commitments by 131.0 million and begins using actual results to test covenant compliance. However, given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, we may determine that it is prudent to continue these suspensions for longer depending on any then-existing limitations on our working capital. We met the terms of the covenants by reducing the incremental revolving credit commitments by 131.0 million during May of 2022. Investors may have an expectation that we will resume our dividend at a certain time and at certain levels or repurchase shares available under Holdings repurchase program. The stock price of Holdings common stock could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors expectations. During the year ended January 1, 2023, we repurchased 3,464,000 shares at an aggregate cost of 96.8 million. Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, financial and other restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, create liens, make investments and other restricted payments, repurchase stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combination . Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control including weather and economic, financial and industry conditions . The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We cannot provide assurance that our liquidity would be sufficient to repay or refinance such indebtedness if it was accelerated upon an event of default. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail

 under the caption Restrictive Covenants in Note 8, Long-Term Indebtedness , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report and under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity, Capital Commitments and Resources Indebtedness Covenant Compliance. Changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect the price of Holdings common stock. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include the sizable attendance and revenue generated from our portfolio of geographically diversified regional theme parks and water parks, vulnerability to cyclical discretionary consumer spending, and seasonality of our operations. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of expanding restrictions and quarantines on the entertainment industry, the credit rating agencies lowered the ratings on several theme park companies in 2020. In June 2021, Moody s changed our outlook from negative to stable and reaffirmed our issuer credit rating of B2 and reaffirmed our issuer-level ratings of Ba2 and B3 on our senior secured and senior unsecured issuances, respectively. Additionally, in June 2021, Standard and Poor s changed our outlook from negative to positive in June 2022. In August 2021, Standard and Poor s increased our issuer credit rating from B- to B+. Standard and Poor s increased the rating on our senior secured issuances from B to BB, and in November 2022, Standard and Poor s increased the rating on our senior unsecured from B- to B. In November 2022, our outlook changed from positive to stable . A negative change in our ratings or the perception such a change might occur could adversely affect the market price of Holdings common stock. Holdings is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. Holdings is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a holding company, it has no significant assets other than its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Holdings is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including the obligations under the Company s debt agreements, and, at such time as dividend payments by Holdings are no longer suspended, to pay dividends on Holdings common stock. If these dividends and other distributions are not sufficient for Holdings to meets its financial obligations, or not available to Holdings due to restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, it could cause Holdings to default on its debt obligations, which would impair our liquidity and adversely affect our financial condition and our business. We had 80.1 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis at January 1, 2023, of which a nominal amount was held at Holdings. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, debt agreements and Delaware law could delay or prevent change of control. Certain provisions in Holdings charter, bylaws and debt agreements could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a merger, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium price over the market price for shares of Holdings common stock. Holdings is also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. General Risk Factors We may not be able to attract and retain key management and other key employees. Our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business.

 Risk related to tariffs and other duties We source merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities located outside of North America. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or may utilize components or materials manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. Our business exposes us to risks associated with global commerce, including changes to tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports. While existing tariffs and duties have not had a material impact on our business, the U.S. government may impose additional tariffs on thousands of products sourced from foreign countries and has expressed a willingness to impose additional or increased tariffs on goods imported from China, including many items that we purchase for our business. While the impact has been immaterial to date, tariffs or duties could lower our gross margin on impacted products. Additionally, even if the products that we import are not affected directly by tariffs or other duties, the imposition of such additional tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased pricing of other consumer goods, which could lower the discretionary income of our potential guests and decrease attendance or in-park spending. We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may increase our operating expenses. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2022 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company and its subsidiaries are from time-to-time engaged in routine legal proceedings incidental to our business. Information regarding our material legal proceedings is included in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. While certain legal proceedings and related indemnification obligations to which we are a party specify the amounts claimed, these claims may not represent reasonably possible losses. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time, nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss, if any, be reasonably estimated, except in circumstances where an aggregate litigation accrual has been recorded for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new information or developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. See Risk Factors Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information and Record Holders Holdings common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SIX. As of March 3, 2023, there were approximately 292 stockholders of record of Holdings common stock. This does not reflect holders who beneficially own common stock held in nominee or street name accounts through brokers or banks. Dividends Holdings did not pay any dividends during the year ended January 1, 2023. We have met the terms required under the 2020 amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which dictated the suspension of the repurchase of Holdings common stock and payment of dividends. We may continue to determine that it is prudent to continue suspending payments of dividends despite completion of the terms required under the 2020 amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We repurchased shares of Holdings common stock under previously approved repurchase plans during the year ended January 1, 2023. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On March 30, 2017, Holdings announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan that permits Holdings to repurchase an incremental 500.0 million in shares of Holdings common stock (the March 2017 Stock Repurchase Plan ). As of March 3, 2023, Holdings had repurchased 8,071,000 shares at a cumulative cost of approximately 365.1 million and an average price per share of 45.24 under the March 2017 Stock Repurchase Plan, leaving approximately 134.9 million available for permitted repurchases. Performance Graph The following graph shows a comparison of the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on Holdings common stock (assuming all dividends were reinvested), The Standard Poor s S P 500 Stock Index, The S P Midcap 400 Index and The S P Entertainment Movies Entertainment Index.

This section provides a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to Six Flags, including a discussion of the impact or potential impact of such standards on our financial statements when applicable. 
 The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking statements included under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of some of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion and analysis presents information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Use of Certain Per Capita Metrics We use certain per capita metrics that are non-GAAP measures of the performance of our business on a per guest basis and believe that these metrics provide relevant and useful information for investors because they assist in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and our industry and allows investors to review performance in the same manner as our management. Total guest spending per capita is the total revenue generated from our guests, on a per guest basis, through admission and in-park spending. Total guest spending per capita is calculated by dividing the sum of park admissions and park food, merchandise and other revenue by total attendance.

 Admissions revenue per capita is the total revenue generated from our guests, on a per guest basis, to enter our parks. Admissions revenue per capita is calculated by dividing park admission revenue by total attendance. In-park revenue per capita is the total revenue generated from our guests, on a per guest basis, on items sold within our parks, such as food, games and merchandise. In-park revenue per capita is calculated by dividing food, merchandise and other revenue by total attendance. 
 Overview We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world and the largest operator of water parks in North America based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 27 regional theme and water parks, 24 are located in the United States, two parks are located in Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America and generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, thereby providing a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. We work continuously to improve our parks and our guests experiences and to meet our guests evolving needs and preferences. Our revenue is derived from (i) the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks (which accounted for approximately 54 of total revenue for the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and approximately 57 of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020), (ii) the sale of food and beverages, merchandise, games and attractions, parking and other services inside our parks (which accounted for approximately 42 , 44 and 35 in total revenue for the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, respectively), and (iii) sponsorship, international agreements and accommodations (which accounted for approximately 4 , 3 and 8 for the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, respectively). Revenue from ticket sales and in-park sales are primarily impacted by park attendance and spending per capita. During 2022, attendance decreased 26 due to increased pricing and the elimination of free tickets and heavily discounted product offerings. Revenue decreased by 9 as lower attendance was offset by higher realized prices on admissions products and a higher mix of single day tickets. The increase in In-park spending per capita was due to many of the Company s in-park pricing initiatives, in-park offerings and a higher mix of single-day ticket guests, who tend to spend more than season pass holders and members on a per visit basis. Revenue from sponsorship, international agreements and accommodations can be impacted by the term, timing and extent of services and fees under these arrangements, which can result in fluctuations from year to year. During the year ended January 1, 2023, our earnings from park operations excluding the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and any other non-cash income or expenditures decreased from prior year, as a result of lower revenue partially offset by a reduction in expenses. Our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages, employee benefits, advertising, third party services, repairs and maintenance, utilities, rent and insurance. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed as our costs for full-time employees, maintenance, utilities, rent, advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. We anticipate that the tight labor market and recent increases to the minimum wage rates will increase our salary, wage and benefit expenses in 2023 and future years. Further legislative changes and competitive wage rate pressure could cause these expenses to continue to increase in the future. Recent Events On January 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ), upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, increased the size of the Board from six to seven members. On January 31, 2023, the Board appointed Marilyn G. Spiegel to serve as an independent director of the Company, effective January 31, 2023, until the Company s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders or until her successor is elected. As Ms. Spiegel joined the Board following the completion of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, she has not executed this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023.

 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses earned and incurred during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are fundamental to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and often require difficult, subjective and complex estimates and judgments. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from the continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. The following discussion addresses the items we have identified as our critical accounting estimates and discusses our review of applicable accounting pronouncements that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of these and other accounting policies.

 Revenue Recognition FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue upon admission into our parks, provision of our services, or when products are delivered to our guests. Revenue is presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations net of sales taxes collected from our guests that are remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. For season passes, memberships in the initial twelve-month term and other multi-use admissions, we estimate a redemption rate based on historical experience and other factors and assumptions we believe to be customary and reasonable and recognize a pro-rata portion of the revenue as the guest attends our parks. For any bundled products with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated using the retail price of each distinct performance obligation and products that are not sold on a stand-alone basis are treated as residual. In contrast to our season pass and other multi-use offerings (such as our all season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat meals and snacks any day they visit the park for one upfront payment) that expire at the end of each operating season, the membership program continues on a month-to-month basis after the initial twelve-month membership term and can be canceled any time after the initial term pursuant to the terms of the membership program. Guests enrolled in the membership program can visit our parks an unlimited number of times anytime the parks are open as long as the guest remains enrolled in the membership program. We review the estimated redemption rate on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year, including impact of changes to our season pass and memberships described above. Amounts owed or received for multi-use admissions in excess of redemptions are recognized in deferred revenue. For active memberships after the initial twelve-month term, we recognize revenue monthly as payments are received. Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. We identify our reporting unit and determine the carrying value of the reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to the reporting unit. We then determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. We have one operating segment and all of our parks are operated in a similar manner and have comparable characteristics in that they produce and distribute similar services and products using similar processes, have similar types of customers, are subject to similar regulations and exhibit similar economic characteristics. As such, we are a single reporting unit. For each year, the fair value of the single reporting unit exceeded our carrying amount (provided that we have one reporting unit at the same level for which Holdings common stock is traded, we believe our market capitalization is the best indicator of our reporting unit s fair value). We have performed a qualitative analysis on our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss occurs to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, if the fair value of the reporting unit were to be less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We review long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of an asset or groups of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets. If such assets are not considered to be fully recoverable, any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets exceeds its respective fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the year ended January 1, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of 16.9 million related to our water park in Houston, Texas.

Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary financial information for the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022: 

Year Ended Percentage (Amounts in thousands, except per capita data) January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Change Total revenue 1,358,236 1,496,905 (9) Operating expenses 591,560 647,250 (9) Selling, general and administrative expenses 162,158 211,381 (23) Costs of products sold 108,146 125,728 (14) Other net periodic pension benefit (5,410) (5,894) (8) Depreciation and amortization 117,124 114,434 2 Loss on impairment of park assets 16,943 N/M Loss on disposal of assets 3,927 12,137 (68) Interest expense, net 141,590 152,436 (7) Loss on debt extinguishment 17,533 N/M Other expense, net 4,126 18,122 (77) Income before income taxes 200,539 221,311 (9) Income tax expense 46,960 49,622 (5) Net income 153,579 171,689 (11) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (44,651) (41,766) 7 Net income attributable to Six Flags Entertainment Corporation 108,928 129,923 (16) Other Data: Attendance 20,434 27,693 (26) Admissions revenue per capita 35.99 28.73 25 In-park revenue per capita 27.94 23.67 18 Total guest spending per capita 63.93 52.40 22 Year Ended January 1, 2023 vs. Year Ended January 2, 2022 Revenue Revenue for the year ended January 1, 2023, totaled 1,358.2 million, a decrease of 138.7 million, or 9 , compared to 1,496.9 million for the year ended January 2, 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in attendance due to an increase in ticket prices, the elimination of free tickets and heavily-discounted pass products, and fewer operating days. Additionally, we did not open five parks in the fourth quarter of 2022 for Holiday in the Park that had operated Holiday in the Park in 2021. In addition, due to the adoption of a fiscal reporting calendar commencing January 1, 2021, there were three fewer days in the year ended January 1, 2023, compared to the year ended January 2, 2022, which accounted for 89 thousand guests in the year ended January 2, 2022. Total guest spending per capita, which excludes sponsorship, international agreements and accommodations revenue, for the year ended January 1, 2023, increased by 11.53, or 22 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022, consisting of a 7.26, or 25 , increase in admissions revenue per capita and a 4.27, or 18 , increase in in-park revenue per capita. The increase in admissions revenue per capita was primarily attributable to higher realized prices on season pass and single day tickets, and the reduction of heavily discounted season pass products and free tickets. The increase in in-park revenue per capita reflects the benefits of our revenue management initiatives and in-park initiatives to improve the guest experience. Operating expenses Operating expenses for the year ended January 1, 2023, decreased 55.7 million, or 9 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022, primarily as a result of lower labor expenditures at the parks due to a reduction in operating days and more efficient labor scheduling during 2022. Additionally, we moved some back-office functions to a shared-services center, which shifted some operating costs to selling, general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increased operating expenses at our California and Mexico parks in the first quarter of 2022, as these

 parks were closed due to COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2021 and higher salaries, wages, utilities and maintenance resulting from inflationary pressures. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended January 1, 2023, decreased 49.2 million, or 23 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022, primarily due to reduced advertising expenses and lower personnel costs. The decline in personnel costs was primarily driven by lower bonus accruals, stock-based compensation and headcount. These reductions were partially offset by higher costs due to the movement of some back-office functions to a shared-services center, which shifted a portion of costs from operating expenses to selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold during the year ended January 1, 2023, decreased 17.6 million, or 14 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022, primarily as a decrease in total units sold. Cost of products sold as a percentage of in-park revenue for the year ended January 1, 2023 decreased slightly relative to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the mix of in-park revenue, an increase in retail prices, and a reduction in membership and season pass discounts. The decrease was partially offset by higher unit costs for food and retail items due to inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended January 1, 2023, increased by 2.7 million, or 2 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced depreciation expense in 2021 as compared to 2022 as our capital expenditures returned to more normalized levels. Loss on disposal of assets We recognized a 3.9 million loss on disposal of assets for the year ended January 1, 2023, compared to a loss on disposal of assets of 12.1 million for the year ended January 2, 2022. These losses on disposal of assets were primarily driven by the write-off of assets in conjunction with our ongoing capital plan. Loss on impairment of park assets We recognized an impairment charge of 16.9 million related to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown. The impairment was allocated between the right-of-use assets and property and equipment, on a proportional basis. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net decreased 9.9 million, or 6 , for the year ended January 1, 2023, compared to the year ended January 2, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the early redemption of 360.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured 7.00 Notes due 2025 during the second quarter. The reduction resulting from the early redemption was partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility and higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, in particular, after the termination of the August 2019 Swap Agreements in March 2022, which increased our unhedged floating rate debt from 79.0 million to 479.0 million. Income tax expense Income tax expense for the year ended January 1, 2023, was 47.0 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.4 . The difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily results from state and foreign income taxes, which are partially offset by the effect of the non-controlling interest income distribution.

 Calculation of EBITDA for the Years Ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 The presentation of Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other relevant metrics in the Credit agreements. Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex are material components of these covenants. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex are not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of income from operations as determined under GAAP. Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex, as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. Modified EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as our consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations: excluding the following: the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, discontinued operations gains or losses, income tax expense or benefit, restructure costs or recoveries, reorganization items (net), other income or expense, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in income or loss of investees, interest expense (net), gain or loss on disposal of assets, gain or loss on the sale of investees, amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and fresh start accounting valuation adjustments. Modified EBITDA, as defined herein, may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Management uses non-GAAP measures for budgeting purposes, measuring actual results, allocating resources and in determining employee incentive compensation. We believe that Modified EBITDA provides relevant and useful information for investors because it assists in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies in our industry as it most closely ties our performance to that of our competitors from a park-level perspective and allows investors to review performance in the same manner as our management. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Modified EBITDA minus the interests of third parties in the Modified EBITDA of properties that are less than wholly owned (consisting of Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags White Water Atlanta and Six Flags Over Texas). Adjusted EBITDA is approximately equal to Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our secured credit agreement, except that Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA excludes Adjusted EBITDA from equity investees that is not distributed to us in cash on a net basis and has limitations on the amounts of certain expenses that are excluded from the calculation. Adjusted EBITDA as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Our board of directors and management use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance and our current management incentive compensation plans are based largely on Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by all our sell-side analysts and most investors as their primary measure of our performance in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants and, in certain circumstances, our ability to make certain borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA minus capex, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures net of property insurance recoveries. Our board of directors and management use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance and our current management incentive compensation plans are based largely on Adjusted EBITDA minus capex. Adjusted EBITDA minus capex as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA minus capex for the years ended January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022:

Year Ended (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Net income 153,579 171,689 Income tax expense 46,960 49,622 Other expense, net 4,126 18,122 Loss on debt extinguishment 17,533 Interest expense, net 141,590 152,436 Loss on disposal of assets 3,927 12,137 Depreciation and amortization 117,124 114,434 Loss on impairment of park assets 16,943 Stock-based compensation 7,673 21,462 Modified EBITDA 509,455 539,902 Third party interest in EBITDA of certain operations (44,651) (41,766) Adjusted EBITDA 464,804 498,136 Capital expenditures, net of property insurance recovery (111,509) (121,742) Adjusted EBITDA minus CAPEX 353,295 376,394 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 84,366 85,708 Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended January 1, 2023, decreased 33.3 million, or 7 , compared to the year ended January 2, 2022. This was primarily driven by a 9 decrease in revenue due to 26 fewer guests. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by reductions in operating expenses, cost of products sold and sales, general and administrative expenses, due to a reduction in full-time headcount, more efficient labor scheduling, and a decrease in operating days. Capital expenditures, net of property insurance recovery, decreased by 9.8 million due primarily to insurance recoveries of 5.1 million and a shift in spending to guest-facing investments that are less costly than marketable capital. Liquidity, Capital Commitments and Resources General Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in parks (including infrastructure and capital projects), payments to our partners in the Partnership Parks, and could include payment of dividends on Holdings common stock and stock repurchases, when permitted. Based on historical and anticipated operating results, we believe cash flows from operations, available cash and amounts available under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including any anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, scheduled debt service and obligations under arrangements relating to the Partnership Parks. We expect to be able to use federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our federal income tax liability for several years. For the years 2023 and 2024, we have significant federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to an annual limitation that will offset approximately 32.5 million and 30.0 million of taxable income, respectively, per year. We expect taxable income in excess of the annual limitation in those years will be partially offset by net operating losses generated during 2020. In accordance with the CARES Act, any net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2020 are not subject to expiration and will carryforward indefinitely.

 Our current and future liquidity is greatly dependent upon our operating results, which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected by a disruption in the availability of credit as well as unfavorable weather; natural disasters; contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 or other variants; accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition at our parks. If such a material adverse event were to occur, we may be unable to borrow under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan or may be required to repay amounts outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and/or may need to seek additional financing. In addition, we expect we may be required to seek additional financing to refinance all or a significant portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity. The degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Cash Flows Our net operating cash flows are largely driven by attendance and guest spending per capita levels, which vary based on the seasonality of our business. Most of our cash-based expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with either attendance or spending per capita assuming that the parks are operational. As of January 1, 2023, we had approximately 80.1 million unrestricted cash and 229.0 million available for borrowing under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan. We plan to strategically reinvest in our parks to improve the guest experience. For more information about our planned capital expenditures, see Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives under Item 1. Business. 

Year Ended (Amounts in thousands) January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities 269,361 334,905 Net cash used in investing activities (111,509) (121,701) Net cash used in financing activities (414,758) (35,144) Effect of exchange rate on cash 1,443 (235) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (255,463) 177,825 During the year ended January 1, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities decreased 65.5 million to 269.4 million, compared to 344.9 million during the period ended January 2, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of 9 . This was partially offset by decreases in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. The largest drivers of the reduction were changes to deferred revenue and accounts receivable which decreased due to the discontinuation of our membership program in favor of more single day tickets and season passes which are typically paid at the time of sale. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 1, 2023, decreased 10.2 million to 111.5 million from 121.7 million, consisting primarily of lower capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds. The decrease is attributable primarily to insurance proceeds of 5.1 million and reductions in marketable capital for the 2022 season. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended January 1, 2023, was 414.8 million. This was primarily attributable to repayments of borrowings of 460.0 million consisting of the early repayment of 360.0 million of the 2025 Notes and 100.0 million on the Revolving Loan, stock repurchases of 96.8 million and partnership distributions of 44.7 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from borrowing 200.0 million on the Revolving Loan. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended January 2, 2022, was 35.1 million, mostly attributable to 41.8 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests in the Partnership Parks. Dividends and Stock Repurchases See Note 12, Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Other Stockholders Equity , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on payment of dividends on Holdings common stock and stock repurchases.

 Indebtedness As of January 1, 2023, our indebtedness consisted of a credit facility and senior notes. See following discussion and Note 8, Long-Term Indebtedness , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details related to our indebtedness. Credit Facility SFTP is the borrower under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility, as amended from time to time, pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2019, as amended, restated, or modified from time to time Credit Agreement ). As of January 1, 2023, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility consisted of a 350.0 million revolving credit loan facility, which had 100.0 million outstanding as of January 1, 2023 and expires on April 17, 2024, and a 479.0 million Tranche B Term Loan facility, which will mature on April 17, 2026. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit loan facility requires compliance with certain conditions, including a maximum senior secured net leverage maintenance covenant, and the absence of any material adverse change in our business or financial condition. If we were to become unable to borrow under the revolving credit loan facility, and we failed to meet our projected results from operations significantly, we might be unable to pay in full our off-season obligations. A default under the revolving credit loan facility could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to accelerate the obligations thereunder. As of January 1, 2023, we had approximately 21.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately 229.0 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit loan facility. See Covenant Compliance discussion below for information regarding our maximum net leverage maintenance covenant, which could impact amounts available for borrowing. We can draw the entire remaining amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit loan facility without being in breach of our maximum net leverage maintenance covenant. 2024 Notes, 2024 Add-on Notes, 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes On June 16, 2016, Holdings issued 300.0 million of 4.875 senior unsecured notes due July 31, 2024 (the 2024 Notes ). On April 13, 2017, Holdings issued an additional 700.0 million of 4.875 Senior Notes due July 31, 2024 (the 2024 Notes Add-on ). Interest payments of 23.1 million for the 2024 Notes and the 2024 Notes Add-on are due semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. On April 13, 2017, Holdings issued 500.0 million of 5.50 Senior Notes due April 15, 2027 (the 2027 Notes ). Interest payments of 13.8 million for the 2027 Notes are due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. On April 22, 2020, SFTP completed the private sale of 725.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00 senior secured notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ). Interest payments of 25.4 million are due semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. On July 1, 2022, Holdings prepaid 360.0 million of the 2025 Notes at a premium of 103.5 . The transaction reduced the outstanding amounts of the 2025 Notes to 365.0 million. We incurred a 17.5 million loss on debt extinguishment containing 12.6 million for the premium paid above par and 5.0 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the transaction. As of January 1, 2023, 949.5 million, 365.0 million, and 500.0 million, was outstanding under the 2024 Notes and 2024 Notes Add-on, the 2025 Notes, and the 2027 Notes, respectively. Covenant Compliance As of January 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the Credit Agreement governing the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and expect to be in compliance for the next twelve months.

 The Credit Agreement requires that, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, our senior secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our Senior Secured Debt to our Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters, not exceed 4.25 to 1.0 (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement). The maximum senior secured leverage ratio will step down to 4.0 to 1.0 beginning with the first fiscal quarter end of 2023, and then down to 3.75 to 1.0 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. In 2020, we entered into amendments to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, allowed us to use our Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 rather than actual Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the corresponding quarters in 2021 when testing of our senior secured leverage ratio throughout 2022. In connection with these amendments, we agreed to various restrictions, including the suspension of dividend payments on Holdings common stock and stock repurchases, a prohibition from prepaying debt, and a requirement that we maintain minimum liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan) of at least 150.0 million for a specified period. The restriction on prepaying debt and the minimum liquidity requirement end on the earlier of December 31, 2022 or such time that we demonstrate compliance with our senior secured leverage ratio using actual results. On May 18, 2022, we reduced and terminated the Series B replacement Revolving Commitments by 131.0 million, which reduced the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan capacity to 350.0 million from 481.0 million. Partnership Park Obligations We guarantee certain obligations relating to the Partnership Parks. These obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately 85.6 million in 2023 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners in the Partnerships Parks (based on our ownership of units as of January 1, 2023, our share of the distribution will be approximately 38.1 million), (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each of the Partnership Parks during rolling five-year periods, based generally on 6 of the Partnership Park s revenues, (iii) an annual offer to purchase all outstanding limited partnership units at the Specified Price to the extent tendered by the unit holders, which annual offer must remain open from March 31 through late April of each year, and any limited partnership interest tendered during such time period must be fully paid for no later than May 15th of that year, (iv) making annual ground lease payments, and (v) either (a) purchasing all of the outstanding limited partnership interests in the Partnership Parks through the exercise of a call option upon the earlier of the occurrence of certain specified events and the end of the term of the partnerships that hold the Partnership Parks in 2027 (in the case of Georgia) and 2028 (in the case of Texas), or (b) causing each of the partnerships that hold the Partnership Parks to have no indebtedness and to meet certain other financial tests as of the end of the term of such partnership. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3 of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears and then towards the repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans.

 (1) See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion on long-term debt. Amounts shown reflect variable interest rates in effect at January 1, 2023. (2) Represents obligations as of January 1, 2023 with respect to insurance, inventory, media and advertising commitments, license fees, computer systems and hardware, and new rides and attractions. Of the amount shown for 2023, approximately 38.1 million represents marketable capital items. The amount for the Warner Bros. license fee is an estimate based on the current amount payable under the license agreement, which is subject to periodic adjustments, and is therefore subject to change. Amounts for new rides and attractions are computed as of January 1, 2023 and include estimates of costs needed to complete such improvements that, in certain cases, are not contractually committed at that date. Amounts do not include obligations to employees that cannot be quantified as of January 1, 2023, which are discussed below. Amounts do not include purchase obligations existing at the individual park-level for supplies and other miscellaneous items, none of which are individually material. 
 Other Obligations During the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, we did not make any contributions to our defined benefit pension plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we made contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of 1.5 million. Our pension plan was frozen effective March 31, 2006, pursuant to which most participants (excluding certain union employees whose benefits have subsequently been frozen) no longer continued to earn future pension benefits. Effective February 16, 2009, the remaining participants in the pension plan no longer earned future benefits. See Note 13, Pension Benefits , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our pension benefit plan. We do not anticipate making any further contributions to our pension plan based on our current funded status. We plan to contribute to our 401(k) Plan in 2023, and our estimated expense for employee health insurance for 2023 is approximately 14 million. We maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe is commercially reasonable and that is available to businesses in our industry. See Insurance under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report. Our insurance premiums and retention levels have remained relatively constant during the three-year period ended January 1, 2023. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks. We are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report and Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on certain significant litigation. We may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on the prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We expect we may be required to seek additional financing to refinance all or a significant portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity. The vast majority of our capital expenditures in 2023 and beyond are expected to be made on a discretionary basis. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting Update 2020-04 ), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in Update 2020-04 apply only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The provisions in Update 2020-04 are effective upon issuance and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. Our adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations, cash flows and equity. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes or speculative purposes. In June 2019, we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 300.0 million (the June 2019 Swap Agreements ). In August 2019, we entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of 400.0 million (the August 2019 Swap Agreements ). These swaps were entered into to mitigate the risk of an increase in the LIBOR interest rate on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B by exchanging the floating LIBOR rate for a negotiated fixed rate. The term of the June 2019 Swap Agreements begins in June 2019 and expires in June 2023. The term of the August 2019 Swap Agreements begins in August 2019 and expires in August 2024. Upon execution, we designated and documented both swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The swap agreements serve as economic hedges and provide protection against rising interest rates. In March 2020, we executed a strategy commonly known as a blend and extend on 100.0 million of the June 2019 Swap Agreements (the Modified June 2019 Swap Agreement that extended the length of one of the June 2019 Swap Agreements through April 2026. We extended the existing pay-fixed swap rate over a longer period than its original term at a lower interest rate, while maintaining the same overall value of the swap. The remaining 200.0 million of the June 2019 Swap Agreements (the Unmodified June 2019 Swap Agreements did not change. Upon execution, we designated and documented the Modified June 2019 Swap Agreement as a cash flow hedge. The Modified June 2019 Swap Agreement serves as an economic hedge and provides protection against rising interest rates. On April 22, 2020, we repaid 315.0 million of the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B. In conjunction, the June 2019 Swap Agreements and the Modified June 2019 Swap Agreement were de-designated, since the hedged items were no longer probable to occur due to the repayment of the debt. As a result, 14.9 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Consistent with company policy, we hold and issue derivative instruments for risk management purposes only and do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Accordingly, in April 2020 we entered into 300.0 million of notional amount counter-agreements (the April 2020 Counter-agreements designed to economically offset the impact of the de-designated swap agreements. On March 24, 2022, we terminated the August 2019 Swap Agreements for net cash proceeds of 7.4 million. The swap agreements were used as economic hedges against rising interest rates and had been designated as cash flow hedges prior to termination. We recorded the settlement in accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of 7.7 million which will be amortized through September 2024 until the maturity of the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B. The following is an analysis of the sensitivity of the market value, operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred as of January 1, 2023. The range of potential change in the market chosen for this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions. These forward-looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments. They do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 1, 2023, we had total long-term debt excluding the impact of debt issuance costs and discounts of 2,393.4 million, of which 1,814.4 million represents fixed-rate debt. The remaining 579.0 million balance represents floating-rate debt. For fixed-rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value, operations or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows, assuming other factors remain constant.

 Assuming other variables remain constant (such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels), the pre-tax operating and cash flow impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately 5.8 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on interest rates under our debt agreements.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Six Flags Entertainment Corporation: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Six Flags Entertainment Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, respectively, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
 51 

Table of Contents 
 generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Estimated redemption rate used to determine multi-use offering programs deferred revenue As discussed in Notes 2(l) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, guests enrolled in the Company s multi-use offering programs, including season pass and membership programs, can visit parks an unlimited number of times during the specified period. For such programs, the Company estimates a redemption rate based on historical experience and other factors and assumptions the Company believes to be customary and reasonable and recognizes a pro-rata portion of the revenue as the guests visit the parks. The Company reviews the estimated redemption rate on an ongoing basis and revises it as necessary throughout the year. As of January 1, 2023, 129 million of deferred revenue was recorded related to the consideration received for multi-use offering programs and other offerings in excess of redemptions. We identified the evaluation of the estimated redemption rate used to determine the multi-use offering programs deferred revenue as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company s assumptions about how future guest attendance patterns may differ from historical attendance patterns due to changes in the parks operations. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s multi-use offering programs deferred revenue process, including controls related to the development of the estimated redemption rate. We assessed outstanding multi-use offering sales utilized by the Company to derive the deferred revenue balance by comparing it to relevant underlying sales documentation. We tested the mathematical accuracy and consistent application of the deferred revenue calculations supporting the recorded deferred revenue account balance. We compared actual guest visits in the current year to the estimated redemption rates. We developed an independent expectation of the deferred revenue balances related to outstanding multi-use offerings programs and compared such expectation to the recorded amount.

 parks we currently own or operate, parks are located in the United States, parks are located in Mexico and park is located in Montreal, Canada. On April 1, 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation Former SFEC , a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks and water parks under the Six Flags name for nearly and established an internationally recognized brand name. We own the Six Flags brand name in the United States and foreign countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, of our current parks are branded as Six Flags parks. Inflation and Supply Chain Our operations can be impacted by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic drivers. Our business relies on a large number of seasonal workers. Our labor costs continue to increase due to shortages of qualified workers and competition from other employers. We continually seek to optimize and deploy our existing employees to both maximize revenue generating opportunities and provide the best guest experience. Hiring and retaining our workers continues to be a priority to avoid further labor shortages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia s invasion of Ukraine, we have experienced widespread supply chain impacts. Supply chain disruption has continued for many of the products and inputs that we use in our parks, including food, merchandise and replacement parts. We have continued to mitigate these impacts to the extent possible by passing these costs on to our customers when possible.

Amounts owed or received for multi-use admissions in excess of redemptions are recognized in deferred revenue. In contrast to our season pass and other multi-use offerings (such as our all season dining pass program, which enables season passholders and members to eat meals and snacks any day they visit the park for upfront payment) that expire at the end of each operating season, the membership program continues on a month-to-month basis after the initial membership term and can be canceled any time after the initial term pursuant to the terms of the membership program. Guests enrolled in the membership program can visit our parks an unlimited number of times whenever the parks are open as long as the guest remains enrolled in the membership program. We review the estimated redemption rate on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year, including impact of changes to our season pass and memberships described above. For any bundled products with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated using the retail price of each distinct performance obligation and products that are not sold on a stand-alone basis are treated as residual. In connection with the temporary closure of our parks due to COVID-19 in March 2020, we added one additional month of membership privileges for every month a member paid but could not visit their home park. The membership payments received while parks were temporarily closed due to the pandemic were included in deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when these additional months are utilized at the end of the respective membership periods. For memberships that remain active following the initial term, we recognize revenue monthly as payments are received. As of January 1, 2023, deferred revenue was primarily comprised of (i) unredeemed season pass and all-season dining pass revenue and (ii) membership payments received while parks were closed during COVID-19. Certain contracts with customers, primarily memberships and season passes, may include bundled products with multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the observable retail prices charged to customers and use residual for any products not sold on a stand-alone basis. We generally expense (i) sales commissions when incurred, and (ii) certain costs to obtain a contract where the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount for which we have the right to invoice for services performed. For certain of our contracts that have an original expected length of one year or less, we use the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and do not consider the time value of money.

 contract because they were negotiated with a single commercial objective. We have identified distinct promises within the agreement with the third party partner as brand licensing, project services and management services. Each of these promises is its own performance obligation and distinct, as the third party could benefit from each service on its own with other readily available resources, and each service is separately identifiable from other services in the context of the contract. We recognize revenue under our international agreements over the relevant service period of each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price, as determined by our best estimate of selling price. We review the service period of each performance obligation on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year. Revisions to the relevant service periods of the performance obligations may result in revisions to revenue in future periods and are recognized in the period in which the change is identified. million and million, respectively.

 million and million as of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss, foreign tax credits and other tax carryforwards, before they expire. The valuation allowance was based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets were recoverable. We expect to generate taxable income that will allow for the utilization of all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards. Our liability for income taxes is finalized as auditable tax years pass their respective statutes of limitations in the various jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. However, these jurisdictions may audit prior years for which the statute of limitations is closed for the purpose of making an adjustment to our taxable income in a year for which the statute of limitations has not closed. Accordingly, taxing authorities of these jurisdictions may audit prior years of the group and its predecessors for the purpose of adjusting net operating loss carryforwards to years for which the statute of limitations has not closed. We classify interest and penalties attributable to income taxes as part of income tax expense. As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, we had accrued interest and penalties liability. Because we do not permanently reinvest foreign earnings, United States deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted foreign earnings to the extent that such foreign earnings are expected to be taxable upon repatriation. For global intangible low taxed income GILTI under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have elected to account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rules (the period cost method ). See Note 11 for further discussion.

 Long-term Contracts Our long-term contracts consist of season passes purchased by customers in the year preceding the operating season to which they relate, sponsorship contracts and international agreements with third parties. We earn season pass revenue when our customers purchase a season pass for a fixed fee, which entitles the customer to visit our parks, including certain water parks, throughout the duration of the parks operating season. We earn sponsorship revenue from separately-priced contracts with third parties pursuant to which we sell and advertise the third party s products within the parks in exchange for consideration. Advertisements may include, but are not limited to, banners, signs, radio ads, association with certain events, sponsorship of rides within our parks and retail promotions. We earn international agreements revenue pursuant to arrangements in which we assist in the development and management of Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America. Within our international agreements, we have identified distinct performance obligations as brand licensing, project services and management services. We do not consider revenue recognized for the performance obligations related to our international agreements to be significant, neither individually nor in the aggregate, to any period presented. See Note 1 for additional information on our accounting for performance obligations under these contracts. The transaction price for our long-term contracts is explicitly stated within the contracts. Our sponsorship contracts and international agreements may include estimated variable consideration such as penalties for delay in performance of contract terms, and certain volume-based discounts and rebates. We do not believe there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. Our brand licensing and management services performance agreements include royalty payments and management fees, respectively, based on gross sales from Six Flags-branded parks once opened. We have elected to apply the sales-based royalty exemption to the brand licensing performance obligation, and accordingly, do not estimate revenue attributable to the gross sales-based royalty. We have also elected to apply the

As of January 2, 2022, the total unearned amount of revenue for remaining long-term contract performance obligations was million. At January 3, 2022, million of unearned revenue associated with outstanding long-term contracts was reported in Deferred revenue, and million was recognized as revenue for long-term contracts during the year ended January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, the total unearned amount of revenue for remaining long-term contract performance obligations was million. As of January 1, 2023, we expect to recognize estimated revenue for partially or wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on long-term contracts of approximately million in 2023 , million in 2024 , million in 2025 and million in 2026 and million in 2027 and thereafter. Short-term Contracts and Other Our short-term contracts consist primarily of season passes and memberships with customers, certain sponsorship contracts and international agreements with third parties. We earn revenue from a customer s purchase of our season pass and membership products, which entitles the customer to visit our parks, including certain water parks, throughout the duration of the parks operating season for a fixed fee. Some membership and season pass products include other benefits and discounts for our guests during their visits. We earn sponsorship and international agreements revenue from contracts with third parties, pursuant to which we sell and advertise the third party s products within our parks on a short-term basis that generally coincides with our annual operating season, and pursuant to certain activities in connection with our international agreements. The transaction price for our short-term contracts is explicitly stated within the contracts. We generally recognize revenue from short-term contracts over the passage of time, with the exception of season pass and membership revenues. We estimate the redemption rate based on historical experience and other factors and assumptions we believe to be customary and reasonable. We review the estimated redemption rate regularly and on an ongoing basis and revise it as necessary throughout the year. Amounts received for multi-use admissions in excess of redemptions are recognized in Deferred revenue. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues from single-day tickets for entrance to our parks, in-park services (such as the sale of food and beverages, merchandise, games and attractions, standalone parking sales and other services inside our parks), accommodations revenue, and other miscellaneous products and services. Due to the short-term transactional nature of such purchases, we apply the practical expedient to recognize revenue for single-day ticket sales, in-park services, accommodations, and other miscellaneous services and goods for which we have the right to invoice. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Certain contracts with customers, primarily season passes and memberships, may include bundled products with multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the observable retail prices charged to customers and use residual for any products not sold on a stand-alone basis. We generally expense

The June 2019 Swap Agreements serve as economic hedges and provide protection against rising interest rates. In August 2019, we entered into the August 2019 Swap Agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million to mitigate the risk of an increase in the LIBOR interest rate in effect on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B. The term of the August 2019 Swap Agreements began in August 2019 and expires in August 2024. Upon execution, we designated and documented the August 2019 Swap Agreements as cash flow hedges. The August 2019 Swap Agreements serve as economic hedges and provide protection against rising interest rates. In March 2020, we executed a strategy commonly known as a blend and extend on million of the June 2019 Swap Agreements that extended the length of one of the June 2019 Swap Agreements through April 2026. We extended the existing pay-fixed swap rate over a longer period than its original term at a lower interest rate, while maintaining the same overall value of the swap. The remaining million of the June 2019 Swap Agreements did not change. On April 22, 2020, we repaid million of the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B. In conjunction, the June 2019 Swap Agreements and the Modified June 2019 Swap Agreement were de-designated, since the hedged interest was no longer probable of occurring due to the repayment of the debt. As a result, million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Consistent with company policy, we hold and issue derivative instruments for risk management purposes only and do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Accordingly, in April 2020 we entered into million of notional amount counter-agreements (the April 2020 Counter-agreements designed to economically offset the impact of the de-designated swap agreements with expiration dates in June 2023 and April 2026.

 million which will be amortized through September 2024 until the maturity of the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B. By utilizing a derivative instrument to hedge our exposure to LIBOR rate changes, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, hedging instruments are placed with counterparties that we believe pose minimal credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates, commodity prices or currency exchange rates. We manage the market risk associated with derivative instruments by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that we may undertake. We hold and issue derivative instruments for risk management purposes only and do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. When in qualifying relationships, the gains and losses on cash flow designated derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL and are reclassified to interest expense when the forecasted transaction takes place. The fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded directly to interest expense .

SFO and certain of the domestic subsidiaries of SFTP (collectively, the Loan Parties ). The Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement contains certain representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and financial covenants (specifically, a maximum senior secured net leverage maintenance covenant). In addition, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement contains restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict, among other things, the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, fundamental changes, restricted payments, capital expenditures, investments, prepayments of certain indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, changes in fiscal periods, modifications of certain documents, activities of the Company and SFO and hedging agreements, subject, in each case, to certain carve-outs. 2024 Notes, 2024 Notes Add-ons, 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes On June 16, 2016, Holdings issued million of senior unsecured notes due July 31, 2024 (the 2024 Notes ).

The 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on, 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes are guaranteed by the Loan Parties. The 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on, 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes contain restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict, among other things, the ability of the Loan Parties to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and repurchase capital stock. The 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on, 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes contain certain events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and representations, cross defaults to other material indebtedness, judgment, and changes of control and bankruptcy events of default. Covenant Compliance The Credit Agreement contains a number of customary negative covenants. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, repurchase stock or engage in transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also requires that as of the end of each fiscal quarter our senior secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our Senior Secured Debt to our Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters, not exceed to 1.0 (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement). The maximum senior secured leverage ratio will step down to to 1.0 beginning with the first fiscal quarter end of 2023, and then down to to 1.0 from the third fiscal quarter of 2023. In 2020, we entered into amendments to the Credit Agreement which, among other things, allowed us to use our Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from 2019 rather than actual Borrower Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the corresponding quarters in 2021 when testing of our senior secured leverage ratio throughout 2022. In connection with these amendments, we agreed to various restrictions, including the suspension of dividend payments on Holdings common stock and stock repurchases, a prohibition from prepaying debt, and a requirement that we maintain minimum liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan) of at least million for a specified period. The restriction on prepaying debt and the minimum liquidity requirement end on the earlier of December 31, 2022 or such time that we demonstrates compliance with our senior secured leverage ratio using actual results. On May 18, 2022, we reduced and terminated the Series B replacement Revolving Commitments by million, which reduced the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan capacity to million from million and began testing our senior secured leverage ratio using actual results.

During the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Long-Term Incentive Plan of million, million and million, respectively, included in selling, general and administrative expense. As of January 1, 2023, options to purchase approximately shares of common stock of Holdings, approximately shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units and approximately shares of performance stock units were outstanding under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and approximately shares were available for future grant. Stock Options Stock options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan are designated as either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock of Holdings on the date of grant. While certain stock options are subject to acceleration in connection with a change in control, stock options are generally cumulatively exercisable in four equal annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant with a term. Generally, the unvested portion of stock option awards is forfeited upon termination of employment. Stock option compensation is recognized over the vesting period using the graded vesting terms of the respective grant. The estimated fair value of our stock options granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. This model takes into account several factors and assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term assumption at the time of grant. We have sufficient historical data to develop an expected term assumption and we calculated the expected term using a mid-point scenario with a one-year grant date filter to exclude grants for which vesting could not have yet occurred. Expected volatility is based three -fourths on the term-matching historical volatility of our stock and one -fourth on the weighted-average implied volatility based on forward-looking pricing data on exchange-traded options for our stock. The expected dividend yield is based on our current quarterly dividend and a three-month average stock price. The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the graded vesting term as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. No stock options were granted during the years ended January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022. The following weighted-average assumptions were utilized in the Black-Scholes model to value the stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020: Expected life (in years) Expected volatility Expected dividend yield

Deferred Share Units Non-employee directors can elect to receive the value of their annual cash retainer as a deferred share unit award DSU under the Long-Term Incentive Plan whereby the non-employee director is granted DSUs in an amount equal to such director s annual cash retainer divided by the closing price of Holdings common stock on the date of the annual stockholders meeting. Each DSU represents Holdings obligation to issue share of common stock. The shares are delivered approximately following the cessation of the non-employee director s service as a director of Holdings. DSUs generally vest consistent with the manner in which non-employee directors cash retainers are paid. The fair value of the DSUs on the date of grant is expensed on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. During the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and December 31, 2020, approximately , and DSUs were granted, respectively. The DSUs had a weighted-average grant date fair value of , and per DSU, respectively. The total grant date fair value of DSUs granted was million for the years ended January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2020 and million for the year ended January 2, 2022. As of January 1, 2023, there was unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding DSUs. Dividend Equivalent Rights On February 8, 2012, Holdings Board of Directors granted dividend equivalent rights DERs to holders of unvested stock options. If and when Holdings paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, the DERs accrue dividends from the stock option grant date through the date of vesting of the stock option, and are distributed, in either cash or stock, upon the vesting of the stock option award. Generally, holders of stock options for fewer than shares of stock will receive their accumulated accrued dividends in cash and holders of stock options for shares of stock or greater will receive their accumulated accrued dividends in shares of common stock. Holdings Board of Directors has not granted stock options since the year ended December 31, 2019; however, many options are still outstanding from prior grants. We recorded a reversal of stock-based compensation for DER grants of million and million for the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively, and stock-based compensation for DER grants of million for the year ended December 31, 2020. All DERs issued upon stock options vesting during these periods accrued based on dividends that Holdings declared prior to the suspension of dividend payments in connection with the increase in the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan in April 2020. Performance Stock Units During the year ended January 2, 2022, performance stock units were granted to key employees that will vest upon the achievement of specified EBITDA and revenue performance goals by 2023.

Under federal tax laws, after emergence from Chapter 11, the Company s NOLs were reduced by approximately million of CODI. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC impose an annual limitation on the utilization of NOLs and other favorable Tax Attribute carryforwards. As a result of the emergence from Chapter 11, the limitation amount is the product of the value of the Company, computed under special rules that apply to a bankruptcy reorganization, and a published rate that applied for the month the Company emerged from Chapter 11. The Company s limitation amount is approximately million for each year to which NOLs and other Tax Attribute carryforwards that existed at emergence are carried forward. The Company has approximately million of NOL carry forwards subject to Section 382 limitation.

Foreign tax credits of million expire between 2023 and 2027. We have a valuation allowance of million and million as of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. We analyze our ability to use our foreign tax credits based on our most probable outcome for future foreign sourced income. Based on that analysis, we have determined it is not more likely than not that some of our foreign tax credits will not be fully utilized and have established a valuation allowance of approximately million at January 1, 2023. The remainder of our valuation allowance at January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 was based on our inability to use state deferred tax assets related to NOLs that were generated in states where we no longer do business or where we have consistently not generated taxable income. The change in valuation allowance is all attributable to income from operations. Our unrecognized tax benefit as of each of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 was million. We classify interest and penalties attributable to income taxes as part of income tax expense. Due to the Company s NOL position, we have not accrued any penalties and interest. , of which shares were outstanding, shares were reserved for future issuance through our Long-Term Incentive Plan, and shares were reserved for future issuance through the ESPP.

Plan benefits are calculated according to a benefit formula based on age, average compensation over the highest consecutive period during the employee s last of employment and years of service. The SFTP Benefit Plan assets are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities, as well as alternative investments, such as hedge funds. The SFTP Benefit Plan does not have significant liabilities other than benefit obligations. Under our funding policy, contributions to the SFTP Benefit Plan are determined using the projected unit credit cost method. This funding policy meets the requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ). We froze the SFTP Benefit Plan effective March 31, 2006, and as of February 16, 2009, participants in the plan no longer earned future benefits.

We anticipate that million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost in 2023. The weighted average assumptions used to determine net costs are as follows: Rate of compensation increase N/A N/A N/A Expected return on plan assets Corridor Average future life expectancy (in years) The discount rate assumption was developed based on high-quality corporate bond yields as of the measurement date. High quality corporate bond yield indices on over AA high grade bonds are considered when selecting the discount rate. The return on plan assets assumption was developed based on consideration of historical market returns, current market conditions, and the SFTP Benefit Plan s past experience. Estimates of future market returns by asset category are reflective of actual long-term historical returns. Overall, it was projected that the SFTP Benefit Plan could achieve a net return over time based on a consistent application of the existing asset allocation strategy and a continuation of the SFTP Benefit Plan s policy of monitoring manager performance. Description of Investment Committee and Strategy The Investment Committee is responsible for managing the investment of SFTP Benefit Plan assets and ensuring that the SFTP Benefit Plan s investment program is in compliance with all provisions of ERISA, other relevant legislation, related SFTP Benefit Plan documents and the Statement of Investment Policy. The Investment Committee has retained several mutual funds, commingled funds and/or investment managers to manage SFTP Benefit Plan assets and implement the investment process. The investment managers, in implementing their investment processes, have the authority and responsibility to select appropriate investments in the asset classes specified by the terms of the applicable prospectus or other investment manager agreements with the SFTP Benefit Plan.

 million, paid in cash. In addition to our obligations under outstanding indebtedness and other securities issued or assumed in the Former SFEC acquisition, we also guaranteed certain contractual obligations relating to the Partnership Parks. Specifically, we guaranteed the obligations of the general partners of those partnerships to (i) make minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately million in 2023 (subject to cost of living adjustments) to the limited partners in the Partnership Parks (based on our ownership of units as of January 1, 2023, our share of the distribution will be approximately million) and (ii) make minimum capital expenditures at each of the Partnership Parks during rolling periods, based generally on of the Partnership Parks revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements, before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the Partnership Park Put ). The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the Specified Price that is the greater of (a) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park s weighted average EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple in the case of SFOG and in the case of SFOT) and (b) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. In light of the temporary suspension of operations of the Partnership Parks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which would cause the value of the limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks to decrease in 2021 and thereafter, we adjusted our annual offer to purchase these units. Accordingly, to preserve liquidity in 2020 and avoid uncertainty with future purchase prices for the units, we adjusted the 2020 offer price to set a minimum price floor for all future purchases. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of January 1, 2023 is million in the case of SFOG and million in the case of SFOT. As of January 1, 2023, we owned approximately and of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. Our obligations with respect to SFOG and SFOT will continue until 2027 and 2028, respectively. In 2027 and 2028, we will have the option to purchase all remaining units in the Georgia limited partner and the Texas limited partner, respectively, at a price based on the Specified Price, increased by a cost of living adjustment. Pursuant to the 2022 annual offer, units from the Texas partnership for approximately million in May 2022. We did not purchase any units from the Georgia partnership during 2022. Pursuant to the 2021 annual offer, we purchased units from the Georgia partnership for approximately million and units from the Texas partnership for approximately million in May 2021. As we purchase additional units, we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions. The maximum unit purchase obligations for 2023 at both parks aggregates to approximately million, representing approximately of the outstanding units of SFOG and of the outstanding units of SFOT. The million accordion feature on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility is available for borrowing for future put obligations if necessary. In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company s entities, Time Warner and an affiliate of Time Warner (an indirect subsidiary of AT T Inc. as a result of a merger in 2018), pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations which own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. The 2022 sale of Time Warner to Discovery did not affect the Time Warner guarantee of our obligations under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.

 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2022 season and intend to incur approximately million of capital expenditures at these parks for the 2023 season, an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements, before any funds are required from us. The Partnership Parks generated approximately million of cash in 2022 from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings. As of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, we had total loans receivable outstanding of million, from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks, primarily to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta, and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners.

The term of the agreement expires in 2053. The license fee is payable on a per-theme park basis, and is subject to CPI increases and scheduled adjustments, including periodic market resets. In November 1999, we entered into license agreements pursuant to which we have the exclusive right on a long-term basis to parks use in Europe, Central and South America of all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license for such use. Under such agreements, the license fee is based on specified percentages of the gross revenues of the applicable parks. Insurance We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to million per occurrence. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is million, followed by a million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our retention contingencies. For workers compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is million. We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of million with a million retention per event. We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2023. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.

In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into settlement agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company s operating expenses. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain, and we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters in excess of the amount that we have recorded for this litigation, which amount is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Litigation Relating to Routine Proceedings We are also engaged from time to time in other routine legal and tax proceedings incidental to our business. We do not believe that any of these routine proceedings will have a material impact on the business or our financial condition. Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an investigation into the Company s disclosures and reporting made in 2018 through February 2020 related to its business, operations and growth prospects of its Six Flags branded parks in China and the financial health of its former business partner, Riverside Investment Group Co. Ltd. The Company received a document subpoena in February 2020 and subsequently certain current and former executives received subpoenas in connection with this matter and they continue to provide responsive information. The Company is fully cooperating and is committed to continuing to cooperate fully with the SEC in this matter. We cannot predict the length, scope or results of the investigation, or the impact, of the investigation on our results of operations, business or financial condition. Tax and other contingencies As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, we had a nominal amount of accrued liabilities for tax and other indemnification contingencies related to certain parks sold in previous years that could be recognized as recovery losses from discontinued operations in the future if such liabilities are not requested to be paid.

The description of the common stock of the Company that follows is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dated May 5, 2021 (the Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the Bylaws ), both filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Authorized Capital Stock The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 285,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 1.00 per share, of which 200,000 shares have been designated as Series B Junior Preferred Stock, and (ii) 280,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.025 per share. There were 86,162,978 shares of the Company s common stock and no shares of the Company s preferred stock issued and outstanding as of January 2, 2022. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over or the right to participate with the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and other distributions in cash, stock of any corporation or property of the Company, such dividends and other distributions may be declared and paid on the common stock out of the assets of the Company that are by law available therefor at such times and in such amounts as the board of directors in its discretion shall determine. Liquidation Rights In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Company and of the preferential and other amounts, if any, to which the holders of preferred stock shall be entitled, the holders of all outstanding shares of common stock shall be entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution ratably in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by each such stockholder. Voting; Proxies All shares of common stock have identical rights and privileges. With limited exceptions, holders of common stock shall have the exclusive right to vote and are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of common stock held of record by each stockholder on all matters, including the electing of directors, properly submitted for the vote of the Company s stockholders. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Company or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Company which are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such 

 stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Every proxy must be authorized in a manner permitted by Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the DGCL or any successor provision. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the secretary of the Company a revocation of the proxy or a new later dated proxy. Other Rights Holders of the Company s common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption, conversion or sinking fund rights. Listing The Company s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SIX. Blank Check Preferred Stock The Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that permit the board of directors to provide for the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of Delaware (referred to herein as Preferred Stock Designation ), to fix from time to time the number of shares to be included in any such series and the designations, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. The rights, preferences, designations and powers of each series of preferred stock may differ with respect to dividends, amounts payable on liquidation, voting, conversion, redemption, sinking funds and other matters. The issuance of shares of the Company s preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Company s common stock and may also adversely affect the availability of earnings for distribution to the holders of the common stock if the preferred stock provides for cumulative dividends, dividend preferences, conversion rights or exchange, redemption or other similar rights or preferences. Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect Certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, as well as the DGCL, may have the effect of discouraging transactions that involve an actual or threatened change in control of the Company. In addition, provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the DGCL may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interests. Additional Authorized Shares of Capital Stock . The additional shares of authorized common stock and preferred stock available for issuance under the Certificate of Incorporation could be issued at such times, under such circumstances and with such terms and conditions as to impede a change in control. In addition, the potential issuance of preferred stock and the designation of rights thereof as described above may have an anti-takeover effect insofar as it may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company. Election of Board of Directors; Absence of Cumulative Voting . The Certificate of Incorporation provides that at each annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders shall elect directors each of whom shall hold office for a term of one year or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, subject to such director s earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect a candidate. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws do not grant stockholders the right to vote cumulatively. The absence of cumulative voting could have the effect of preventing stockholders holding a minority of the Company s shares from obtaining representation on the board of directors. 

 Number of Directors . The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors shall initially be fixed at nine (9) and shall thereafter be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. This provision could prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of the Company s board of directors and gaining control of the Company s board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies on the Board of Directors . Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the board of directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, even if the number of such directors then in office is less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, if applicable. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom such director has replaced or until such director s successor has been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors may shorten the term of any incumbent director. Special Meetings of Stockholders . Only the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer of the Company, the president of the Company, or the secretary of the Company may call a special meeting of stockholders within 10 calendar days after receipt of written request of the board of directors or upon written request of stockholders holding shares representing at least twenty percent (20 of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter for which such meeting is to be called, voting as a single class, provided, however, that such stockholders may only make such request in respect of a special meeting of stockholders, one of the purposes of which is to elect or remove directors. Advance Notice of Stockholder Action at a Meeting . Stockholders seeking to nominate directors or to bring business before a stockholder meeting must comply with certain timing requirements and submit certain information to the Company in advance of such meeting. Proxy Access. Under the Bylaws, a stockholder (or a group of up to 20 stockholders) who has held at least 3 of the Company s common stock for three years or more may nominate a director and have that nominee included in the Company s proxy materials, provided that the stockholder and nominee satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. Any stockholder who intends to use these procedures to nominate a candidate for election to the board of directors for inclusion in the Company s proxy statement must satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. Adoption, Alteration or Repeal of Bylaws . The board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter and repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, alteration or repeal of a Bylaw must be approved by either (a) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board (as defined below) or the unanimous written consent of all members of the board of directors, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75 of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class. Whole Board means the total number of directors the Company would have if there were no vacancies. Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law The Company is a Delaware corporation subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 provides that, subject to certain exceptions specified in the law, a Delaware corporation shall not engage in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a three-year period after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless: prior to such time, the board of directors of the Company approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; 

upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the Company outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the Company and authorized by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with that person s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15 or more of the voting stock of the Company. Under certain circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who would be an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. The provisions of Section 203 may encourage companies interested in acquiring the Company to negotiate in advance with the board of directors of the Company because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if the board of directors of the Company approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for the Company s common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
