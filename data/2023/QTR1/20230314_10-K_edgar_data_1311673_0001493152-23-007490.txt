PART
I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

Background 

Yale
Transaction Finders, Inc. (the Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October
20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. On April 15, 2003, the
Company filed a subsequent amendment to change the name to Yacht Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder s Inc. business plan was to create
an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers to interface immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of targeting
a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. The Company s
business plan then consisted of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase
or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. On March 22, 2022, the Company entered into and consummated a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Fountainhead Capital Management Limited, a Jersey company (the Seller ),
Ironbound Partners Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Moyo Partners, LLC, a New York limited liability company, Dakota
Group, Ltd., a New York limited liability company, and Rise Capital Corp., a New York corporation (each a Purchaser and
together, the Purchasers ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Seller sold to Purchasers an aggregate of 5,120,000
shares of common stock of the Company held by the Seller (the Shares ), representing approximately 98.5 of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of 352,641. The Purchasers owned no other shares of capital stock of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Purchase Agreement. On April 7, 2022, the Company filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
to change the name to Yale Transaction Finders, Inc. 

The
Company s current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more properties or businesses, and to
pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase,
merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership.
The Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity.
The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. 

The
Company s principal shareholders are in contact with broker-dealers and other persons with whom they are acquainted who are involved
in corporate finance matters to advise them of the Company s existence and to determine if any companies or businesses they represent
have an interest in considering a merger or acquisition with the Company. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful
in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are available for acquisitions, or that any acquisition
that occurs will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders. 

3 

The
Company s search is directed toward enterprises that have a desire to become public corporations
and that are able to satisfy or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy, the minimum asset and other requirements
in order to qualify shares for trading on one of the OTC or NASDAQ Markets or a national stock exchange (See Investigation and
Selection of Business Opportunities ). The Company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it may (i) be recently
organized with no operating history, or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market; (iv)
be relying upon an untested product or marketing concept; or (v) have a combination of the characteristics mentioned in (i) through (iv).
The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued. Given the
above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have a history of losses or low profitability. 

The
Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry, and may,
therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources. The Company s discretion
in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and
other factors. 

Any
entity which has an interest in being acquired by, or merging into the Company, is expected to be an entity that desires to become a
public company and establish a public trading market for its securities. In connection with such a merger or acquisition, it is highly
likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the Company would be issued by the Company or purchased from the current principal
shareholders of the Company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates. If stock is purchased from the current shareholders, the transaction
is very likely to result in substantial gains to them relative to their purchase price for such stock. In the Company s judgment,
none of its officers and directors would thereby become an underwriter within the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. The sale of a controlling interest by certain principal shareholders of the Company could occur at a time when
the other shareholders of the Company remain subject to restrictions on the transfer of their shares. 

It
is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the Company s attention from various sources, including its principal
shareholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of
the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no current plans, understandings,
agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company. 

The
Company does not currently foresee that it would enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which its
officers, directors or principal shareholders are currently affiliated. Should the Company determine in the future, contrary to
foregoing expectations, that a transaction with an affiliate would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the
Company is, in general, permitted by Delaware law to enter into such a transaction if: 

1.
The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known
to the Board of Directors, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or 

2.
The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the affiliate and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known
to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders;
or 

3.
The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors
or the stockholders. 

4 

Investigation
and Selection of Business Opportunities 

To
a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon the principal shareholders analysis
of the quality of the other company s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts,
the merit of technological changes, the perceived benefit the Company will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and numerous
other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. In many instances,
it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential
for the future because of the possible need to access capital, shift marketing approaches substantially, expand significantly, change
product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. The Company will be dependent upon the owners of
a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement, or be primarily responsible for the implementation
of, required changes. Because the Company may participate in a business opportunity with a newly organized firm or with a firm which
is entering a new phase of growth, it should be emphasized that the Company will incur further risks, because management in many instances
will not have proved its abilities or effectiveness, the eventual market for such company s products or services will likely not
be established, and such company may not be profitable when acquired. 

It
is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to one such venture because of the Company s
limited financial resources. This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity
against profits from another and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision to purchase the Company s securities. 

It
is emphasized that the Company may affect transactions having a potentially adverse impact upon the Company s shareholders pursuant
to the authority and discretion of the Company s management and board of directors to complete acquisitions without submitting
any proposal to the stockholders for their consideration. Holders of the Company s securities should not anticipate that the Company
will necessarily furnish such holders, prior to any merger or acquisition, with financial statements, or any other documentation, concerning
a target company or its business. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to
the stockholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by such directors to seek the stockholders advice and consent or
because state law so requires. 

The
analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company s principal shareholders, who
are not professional business analysts. Although there are no current plans to do so, the Company might hire outside consultants to assist
in the investigation and selection of business opportunities and might pay a finder s fee. Since the Company has no current plans
to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, no policies have been
adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services
to be provided, the term of service, or regarding the total amount of fees that may be paid. However, because of the limited resources
of the Company, it is likely that any such fees the Company agrees to pay would be paid in stock and not in cash. Otherwise, the Company
anticipates that it will consider, among other things, the following factors: 

1.
Potential for growth and profitability, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products; 

2.
The Company s perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by the Company s
stockholders; 

3.
Whether, following the business combination, the financial condition of the business opportunity would be, or would have a significant
prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable the securities of the Company to qualify for listing on an exchange
or on a national automated securities quotation system, such as OTC Markets or NASDAQ, so as to permit the trading of such securities
to be exempt from the requirements of Rule 15c2-6 adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission; 

4.
Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale
of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other sources; 

5.
The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

5 

6.
Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the
industry as a whole; 

7.
Strength and diversity of existing management, or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment; 

8.
The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potential; and 

9.
The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items. 

In
regard to the possibility that the shares of the Company would qualify for listing on one of the OTC or NASDAQ Markets or another national securities exchange, the current
standards include the requirements that the issuer of the securities satisfy, among other requirements, certain minimum levels of
shareholder equity, market value or net income. Many of the business opportunities that might be potential candidates for a
combination with the Company may not satisfy any of the listing criteria. 

Not
one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity, and the Company will attempt to analyze
all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data.
Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which
will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. Potential investors
must recognize that, because of the Company s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately
evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. 

The
Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. Prior to making a decision to participate in a business
opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing
such items as a description of products, services and company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections,
with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents,
trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions
between such company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks
and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they
are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurances that audited financial statements would be able
to be produced within a reasonable period of time following completion of a merger transaction; and other information deemed relevant. 

As
part of the Company s investigation, the Company s principal shareholders may meet personally with management and key personnel,
may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references
of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company s limited financial
resources. 

It
is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the
impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of penny stocks. The regulations would
affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company s securities until such time as they qualify for listing
on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the penny stock regulations. 

The
Company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company
to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity
for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities
and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates
which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development
of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates who have a need for an immediate
cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative. 

There
are no loan arrangements or arrangements for any financing whatsoever relating to any business opportunities currently available. 

6 

Form
of Acquisition 

It
is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will
be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that
review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to
be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint
ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation
or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with
other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the
surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control
of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company s
existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 

It
is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities
of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the
criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e., 80 or more) of the
common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of
these provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company s current
stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20 or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional
dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares
might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal
shareholders. 

It
is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available,
from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the
transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions
or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market
that might develop in the Company s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market. 

The
Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms
of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the
parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of
the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon
default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type. 

7 

As
a general matter, the Company anticipates that it, and/or its officers and principal shareholders will enter into a letter of intent
with the management, principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement. Such letter of
intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will generally not bind any of the parties to consummate the transaction.
Execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable. Neither the Company nor any
of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until a definitive agreement concerning
the acquisition as described in the preceding paragraph is executed. Even after a definitive agreement is executed, it is possible that
the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right provided in the agreement to terminate it on specified
grounds. 

It
is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements,
disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made
not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable.
Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided,
the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services. 

In
all probability, upon completion of an acquisition or merger, there will be a change in control through issuance of substantially more
shares of common stock. Further, in conjunction with an acquisition or merger, it is likely that the principal shareholders may offer
to sell a controlling interest at a price not relative to or reflective of a price which could be achieved by individual shareholders
at the time. 

Investment
Company Act and Other Regulation 

The
Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business. The Company does
not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid
being classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Act ),
and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

3(a) of the Investment Act contains the definition of an investment company, and it excludes any entity that does not engage
primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or that does not engage in the business of investing, owning,
holding or trading investment securities (defined as all securities other than government securities or securities
of majority-owned subsidiaries the value of which exceeds 40 of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities,
cash or cash items). The Company intends to implement its business plan in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception
from the definition of investment company. Consequently, the Company s participation in a business or opportunity
through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited. 

The
Company s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates
a reorganization as discussed above. Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment
company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections. 

Any
securities which the Company might acquire in exchange for its Common Stock are expected to be restricted securities within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ). If the Company elects to resell such securities, such
sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or an
exemption from registration is available. Section 4(1) of the Act, which exempts sales of securities not involving a distribution, would
in all likelihood be available to permit a private sale. Although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities acquired,
if such a sale were to be necessary, the Company would be required to comply with the provisions of the Act to affect such resale. 

An
acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance
with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process. 

8 

Competition 

The
Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive opportunities, primarily from business development
companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small
investment companies, and wealthy individuals. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial
capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Overview 

The
Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 15, 2000 as Sneeoosh Corporation. On October 20, 2000 the company filed an amended Certificate
of Incorporation to change the name to Snohomish Corporation. On April 15, 2003 the company filed a subsequent amendment to change the
name to Yacht Finders, Inc. Yacht Finder s Inc. business plan was to create an online database for public buyers and yacht brokers
to interface immediately with each other while capturing the benefits of targeting a larger market. On November 6, 2007, the Company
discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. On March 22, 2022, the Company entered into and consummated a Purchase
Agreement with the Seller and the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Seller sold to Purchasers an aggregate of 5,120,000
Shares, representing approximately 98.5 of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of 352,641.
The Purchasers owned no other shares of capital stock of the Company prior to the consummation of the Purchase Agreement. On April 7,
2022, the Company filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to change the name to Yale Transaction Finders, Inc. 

The
Company s business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets,
share purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. 

10 

The
Company s current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire one or more properties or businesses, and to
pursue other related activities intended to enhance shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by purchase,
merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership.

We
recorded a net loss of 68,042 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with a net loss of 90,021 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to the termination of a management services agreement with Fountainhead Capital Management Limited. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had no assets, a working capital deficit of 46,295 and an accumulated deficit of 1,276,558. Our operating
activities used 58,871 in cash for the fiscal year period ended December 31, 2022, while our operations used 34,875 cash in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 20201. We earned no revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

Historically,
we have depended on loans from our principal shareholders and their affiliated companies to provide us with working capital as required.
There is no guarantee that such funding will be available when required and there can be no assurance that our stockholders, or any of
them, will continue making loans or advances to us in the future. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had loans and notes outstanding from the Purchasers in the aggregate amount of 50,000. The principal
and accrued interest on the notes are convertible, at the election of the holders, into shares of the Company s common stock following
the consummation of a Qualified Financing (as defined in the notes), or upon the consummation of a Fundamental Transaction 
(as defined in the notes) at the Conversion Price (as defined in the notes). 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not
generated any revenue since inception. The Company generated a net loss of 68,042 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and had a working
capital deficit of 46,295 as of December 31, 2022. These conditions, among others, raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on working capital advances
being provided by the Company s majority shareholder for its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as
may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. Management believes that the Company s majority shareholder will provide
the additional funding to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, however, there is no guarantee this will happen. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that
the working capital advances will continue in the future nor that Company will be successful in raising additional funds through other
sources. 

In
December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of
other countries, including the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In addition, as of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, several states in the United States and elsewhere have
declared states of emergency, and several countries around the world, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel.
While the Company presently has no ongoing operations or employees, this situation could limit the market for a merger partner for a
strategic business combination. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition
or results of operations. In addition, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of the Company s data
centers or its critical business or information technology systems would severely affect the ability to conduct normal business operations
and, as a result, the operating results would be adversely affected.

condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to an investor in our securities.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
Accounting Policies suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the
ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and require management to
make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The nature of our business generally does not call for the preparation or use of estimates. Please refer to footnote 2 of the Financial
Statements with respect to significant accounting policies.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Yale Transaction Finders, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of year ended December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses since inception, has a shareholder deficit, and the Company
and has not established revenue sources to cover its operating costs these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

13 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

A
critical audit matter is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee or the Company s governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
a critical audit, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We
determined that there are no critical audit matters communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee. 

Other
Matters 

The
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Yale Transaction Finders, Inc. as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes were
audited by another Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Boyle CPA, PLLC.

To
the Shareholders and

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Yale Transaction Finders, Inc. (formerly Yacht Finders, Inc.) (the Company as of December 31, 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit), and cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company s lack of revenues, recurring operating losses and working capital deficit raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management s
plans are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis of Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment,
management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because
it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal
financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Company s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

26 

As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on
that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this annual report, such internal controls and procedures were not
effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed
in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may
be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control
objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses
were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result
in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management s report in this annual report. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

Given
the financial resources available to the Company, the Company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the identified
material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls. As such time as the Company commences operations and has
the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses, we intend to create take action to do so. Unfortunately,
until the Company has such financial resources, the identified weaknesses will continue to exist. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . During the last quarter of the Company s fiscal year ended December
31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls . A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

J. Ledecky has been a Director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company since March 22, 2022. Mr.

companies is a blank check company that is currently searching for an initial business combination. From July 2019 to December 2020,
he was also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pivotal Investment Corporation II (NYSE: PIC), a blank
check company that consummated an initial business combination with XL Fleet, a provider of fleet electrification solutions for commercial
vehicles in North America. From August 2018 to December 2019, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pivotal Acquisition

of eDiscovery, information governance and data recovery solutions to corporations, law firms, insurance companies and individuals, in
December 2019. Mr. Ledecky continued to serve as a member of the board of KLDiscovery from its merger until June 2021. Mr. Ledecky previously
founded U.S. Office Products in October 1994 and served as its Chief Executive Officer until November 1997 and as its Chairman until
its sale in June 1998. U.S. Office Products was one of the fastest start-up entrants in the history of the Fortune 500 with sales in
excess of 3 billion within its first three years of operation. From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Ledecky was vice chairman of Lincoln Holdings,
owners of the Washington sports franchises in the NBA, NHL and WNBA. He has served as a trustee of George Washington University and the
U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation, director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and as a commissioner on the National Commission on
Entrepreneurship. In 2004, Mr. Ledecky was elected the Chief Marshal of the 2004 Harvard University Commencement, an honor bestowed by
his alumni peers for a 25th reunion graduate deemed to have made exceptional contributions to Harvard and the greater society while achieving
outstanding professional success. Mr. Ledecky received a B.A. (cum laude) from Harvard University in 1979 and an M.B.A. from the Harvard
Business School in 1983. We believe Mr. Ledecky s qualifications to serve on the Board include his extensive executive leadership
and business and entrepreneurial experience, including experience with public shell companies looking to make acquisitions.

Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We
do not currently have an audit committee financial expert, nor do we have an audit committee. Our entire board of directors, which currently
consists of Mr. Ledecky, handles the functions that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. We do not currently have the capital
resources to pay director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing
to act as an audit committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board of directors we expect that
we will seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining any such expert our board
would make a determination as to whether such person is independent. 

28 

Code
of Ethics 

Our
board of directors has adopted a code of ethics that our officers, directors and any person who may perform similar functions are subject
to. Currently, Messrs. Ledecky and Kling are our only officers and Mr. Ledecky is our sole director; therefore, they are the only persons
subject to the Code of Ethics. If we retain additional officers in the future to act as our principal financial officer, principal accounting
officer, controller or persons serving similar functions, they would become subject to the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics does not
indicate the consequences of a breach of the code. If there is a breach, the board of directors would review the facts and circumstances
surrounding the breach and take action that it deems appropriate, which action may include dismissal of the employee who breached the
code. Currently, since Mr. Leedecky is our only director, he will be responsible for reviewing his own conduct under the Code of Ethics
and determining what action to take in the event of any breach of the Code of Ethics by him if any occurred. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

No
past officer or director of the Company has received any compensation and none is due or payable. Our current officers and directors
do not receive any compensation for the services they render to the Company, have not received compensation in the past, and are not
accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the Company. We currently have no formal written salary arrangement with our
officers. Messrs. Ledecky and Kling may receive a salary or other compensation for services that they provide to the Company in the future.
No retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company
for the benefit of the Company s employees.

the SEC on March 26, 2008 as Exhibit 10.1 thereto. The Services Agreement was terminated by mutual agreement as of June 30, 2021. All
amounts owed under the Services Agreement were added to the principal amount of the note referred to above. 

On

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES. 

AUDIT
FEES 

The
aggregate fees billed by our former auditors, Boyle CPA, LLC for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 7,000 and 9,000,
respectively. 

30 

AUDIT-RELATED
FEES 

During
the last two fiscal years, no fees were billed or incurred for assurance or related services by our auditors that were reasonably related
to the audit or review of financial statements reported above. 

TAX
FEES 

Tax
preparation fees billed for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 2,250 and 2,250. 

ALL
OTHER FEES 

During
the last two fiscal years, no other fees were billed or incurred for services by our auditors other than the fees noted above. Our board,
acting as an audit committee, deemed the fees charged to be compatible with maintenance of the independence of our auditors. 

THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES 

We
do not have a separate audit committee. Our full board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee. Before an independent
auditor is engaged by us to render audit or non-audit services, our board of directors pre-approves the engagement. Board of directors
pre-approval of audit and non-audit services will not be required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant to pre-approval
policies and procedures established by our board of directors regarding our engagement of the independent auditor, provided the policies
and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, our board of directors is informed of each service provided, and such policies
and procedures do not include delegation of our board of directors responsibilities under the Exchange Act to our management.
Our board of directors may delegate to one or more designated members of our board of directors the authority to grant pre-approvals,
provided such approvals are presented to the board of directors at a subsequent meeting. If our board of directors elects to establish
pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the board of directors must be informed of each non-audit service
provided by the independent accountant. Board of Directors pre-approval of non-audit services, other than review and attest services,
also will not be required if such services fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. For the fiscal year ended December
31, 2022, 100 of audit-related services, tax services and other services performed by our independent accountants were pre-approved
by our board of directors. 

Our
board has considered whether the services described above under the caption All Other Fees , which are currently none, is
compatible with maintaining the auditor s independence. 

The
board approved all fees described above.
