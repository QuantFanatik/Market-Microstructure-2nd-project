 EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2022 of Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Simon mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to we, us and our mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. Simon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon s majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2022, Simon owned an approximate 87.4 ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 12.6 ownership interest owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. We operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, Simon consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and Simon has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. We believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: enhances investors understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 We believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances by Simon, preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties. The presentation of stockholders equity, partners equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Simon and those of the Operating Partnership. The differences between stockholders equity and partners equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners equity in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon s financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Although classified differently, total equity of Simon and the Operating Partnership is the same. To help investors understand the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report provides: separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;

Table of Contents 
 a single set of notes to such consolidated financial statements that includes separate discussions of noncontrolling interests and stockholders equity or partners equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and per share and per unit data, as applicable; a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that also includes discrete information related to each entity; and separate Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities sections related to each entity. 
 This report also includes separate Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of Simon and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Simon and the Operating Partnership are each compliant with Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. 1350. The separate discussions of Simon and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand our results on a consolidated basis and how management operates our business. In order to highlight the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for Simon and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to Simon and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings of Simon and the Operating Partnership as being our actions or holdings. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures, holds assets and incurs debt, we believe that references to we, us or our in this context is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and we operate substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership.

 Part I Item 1. Business Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100 of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Simon mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to we, us and our mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon. We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets , and The Mills . As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held an interest in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 94 malls, 69 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80 noncontrolling interest in The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2022, we had ownership interests in 34 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, we also owned a 22.4 equity stake in Kl pierre SA, or Kl pierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe. For a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2022, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K. Other Policies The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote. Investment Policies While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with Simon s qualification as a REIT. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that Simon cannot make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75 of its total assets. Simon must also derive at least 75 of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including rents from real property, dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, Simon must also derive at least 95 of its gross income from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing. Subject to Simon s REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies. Additionally we have and may in the future make investments in entities engaged in non-real estate activities, primarily through a taxable REIT subsidiary, similar to the investments we currently hold in certain retail operations. Financing Policies Because Simon s REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, we regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties, and refinance maturing debt. We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership s lines of credit and the indentures 
 5 

Table of Contents 
 for the Operating Partnership s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 65 , or 60 in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related agreements, and secured debt to 50 of total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons, including their effect on our ability to access attractive capital, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future. If Simon s Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or incurring debt, creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties, entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects, retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods. If Simon s Board of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. Simon s Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. We may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units. Such securities also may include additional classes of Simon s preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, which may be convertible into common stock or units, as the case may be. Existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us. Any issuance of equity could dilute a stockholder s investment in Simon or a limited partner s investment in the Operating Partnership. We expect most future borrowings will be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the Operating Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. We issue unsecured debt securities through the Operating Partnership, but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so. The Operating Partnership has a 4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility and a 3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, or together, the Credit Facilities. The Credit Facility can be increased in the form of additional commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1.0 billion, for a total aggregate size of 5.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30, 2024. The Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2025, at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.650 and 1.400 or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500 or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000 (the Base Rate ), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000 and 0.400 . The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100 and 0.300 on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Credit Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The Supplemental Facility s initial borrowing capacity of 3.5 billion may be increased to 4.5 billion during its term. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility is January 31, 2026 and can be extended for an additional year to January 31, 2027 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof. Borrowings under the Supplemental Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between

 0.650 and 1.400 or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500 or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000 (the Base Rate ), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000 and 0.400 . The Supplemental Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100 and 0.300 on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Supplemental Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The Operating Partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program, or Commercial Paper program, of 2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. Notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities and, if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. We may also finance our business through the following: issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock or warrants to purchase the same; issuance of additional units; issuance of preferred units; issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt; draws on our Credit Facilities; borrowings under the Commercial Paper program; or sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties. 
 The Operating Partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the Internal Revenue Code. We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties. Additionally, the Credit Facilities, our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain. Typically, we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real estate industry, are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness. Conflict of Interest Policies We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Simon has adopted governance principles governing the function, conduct, selection, orientation and duties of its subsidiaries and Simon s Board of Directors and the Company, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of Simon s Board of Directors. In addition, Simon s Board of Directors has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of its officers, directors, and employees and those of its subsidiaries. At least a majority of the members of Simon s Board of Directors must qualify, and do qualify, as independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family, who are significant stockholders in Simon and/or unitholders in the Operating Partnership. In addition, the Audit and Compensation and Human Capital Committees 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 of Simon s Board of Directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence and financial expert requirements of the NYSE as required. The sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simon family or other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Any transaction between us and the Simon family, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by the Company s Audit Committee. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, the Simon charter requires that at least three-fourths of Simon s independent directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. A noncompetition agreement executed by Herbert Simon, Simon s Chairman Emeritus, and a noncompetition agreement executed by David Simon, Simon s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, which remains in effect notwithstanding the expiration of David Simon s employment agreement in 2019, contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities. Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities We intend to make investments which are consistent with Simon s qualification as a REIT, unless Simon s Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in Simon s best interests to so qualify as a REIT. Simon s Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. Simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire Simon s shares, the Operating Partnership s units, or any other securities. On May 16, 2022, Simon s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan, or the Repurchase Program. Under the program, the Company may purchase up to 2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period ending May 16, 2024. Simon may also issue shares of its common stock, or pay cash at its option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders rights under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of Simon for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that own real estate assets. Competition The retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels, including malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs, including our tenants, which provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties. The existence of competitive alternatives, accelerated by the impact of COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties). We believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers, including: the quality, location and diversity of our properties; our management and operational expertise; our extensive experience and relationships with retailers, lenders and suppliers; our marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; and the sustainability of physical retail. 
 Certain Activities During the past three years, we have: issued 354,455 shares of Simon common stock upon the exchange of units in the Operating Partnership; issued 751,042 restricted shares of Simon common stock and 108,694 long-term incentive performance units, or LTIP units, net of forfeitures, under The Simon Property Group 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or the 1998 Plan, and the Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan;

 Human Capital At December 31, 2022, we and our affiliates employed approximately 3,300 persons at various properties and offices throughout the United States, of which approximately 800 were part-time. Approximately 1,000 of these employees were located at our corporate headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. We believe our employees are the driving force behind our success. To ensure we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent across the organization, we invest in our employees and provide equal opportunities. We offer a variety of ongoing talent programs that foster continual development, high performance and overall organizational effectiveness, including a series of leadership development programs. We conduct an annual talent-assessment process for selected business functions within our corporate and field organizations that includes plans for individual employee career development and long-term leadership succession, and also conduct an annual performance appraisal process for all regular employees. We are focused on providing a work environment that is free from any form of discrimination or harassment for any protected class and also embraces principles of inclusiveness. We have implemented a sustainable diversity and inclusion strategy, including an internal policy, targeted solutions for employees and an annual process of assessment, action and evaluation led by our human resources department. Our compensation program is designed to, among other things, attract, retain and motivate talented and experienced individuals using a mix of competitive salaries, bonuses, equity based awards and other benefits. Government Regulations Affecting Our Properties We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operations conducted on real property. As of December 31, 2022, we are not aware of any environmental conditions or material costs of complying with environmental or other regulations that would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, it is possible that we are not aware of, or may become subject to, potential environmental liabilities or material costs of complying with governmental regulations that could be material.

Risk Factors The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, funds from operations, or FFO, and prospects, which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us, and you should carefully consider them. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results. We may update these factors in our future periodic reports. Summary of Risk Factors The following summarizes our material risk factors. However, this summary is not intended to be a comprehensive and complete list of all risk factors identified by the Company. Refer to the following pages of this section for additional details regarding these summarized risk factors and other additional risk factors identified by the Company. Conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us. Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants. We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies. Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all. Acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity and actual or threatened terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business operations. We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and governmental reactions thereto, as well as other future epidemics, pandemics or public health crises, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders. Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance. We face risks associated with climate change. As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful. We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs in the United States. The failure to maintain Simon s or the Subsidiary REITs qualifications as REITs or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences. If the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. Our ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm s-length terms. Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares. The tax imposed on REITs engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan. Partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us. Legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs, including positions taken by the IRS, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors. Provisions in Simon s charter and by-laws and in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control. We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations. The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely. Disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk. We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them. The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties. We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. An increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance ESG factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. Our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and develop talented employees, and our failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business. Risk Related to Tenant Operations at Our Properties Conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us. Our primary source of revenue is derived from retail tenants which means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally, including, without limitation: domestic issues, such as government policies and regulations, tariffs, energy prices, market dynamics, rising interest rates, inflation and limited growth in consumer income as well as from actual or perceived changes in economic conditions, which can result from global events such as international trade disputes, a foreign debt crisis, foreign currency volatility, natural disasters, war, such as the conflict in Ukraine, epidemics and pandemics, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, civil unrest and terrorism, as well as from; levels of consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, income levels, and fluctuations in seasonal spending in the United States and internationally;

 supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; consumers avoiding in-person shopping due to a heightened level of concern for safety in public places due to heightened sensitivity to risks associated with transmission of disease, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, or consumer perception of increased risk of criminal activity and civil unrest, including acts of terrorism, riots, random acts of violence, mass shootings or inappropriate or unacceptable behavior of other patrons; significant reductions in international travel and tourism, resulting in fewer international retail consumers; consumer perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties; the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties from the increasing use of the Internet by retailers and consumers, which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic; the creditworthiness of our retail tenants and the availability of new creditworthy tenants and the related impact on our occupancy levels and lease income; local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates and declines in real estate values; the willingness of retailers to lease space in our properties at attractive rents, or at all; changes in regional and local economies, which may be affected by increased rates of unemployment, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, decreased tourism, industry slowdowns, adverse weather conditions, and other factors; increased operating costs and capital expenditures, whether from redevelopments, replacing tenants or otherwise; changes in applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning; and epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and the governmental reaction thereto. To the extent that any or a portion of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the emergence of new tenants, our own investments in certain retailers and brands, the demand for retail space, market rents and rent growth, the vacancy levels at our properties, the value of our properties, which could directly or indirectly materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and overall asset value. Additionally, a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants. Accordingly, declines in our tenants sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties. Over time, declines in our tenants sales performance can also negatively impact our ability to sign new and renewal leases at desired rents. Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants. Our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. Certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations, downsized their brick-and-mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others, and such actions became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustained adverse pressure on the results of department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results. Certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future (given uncertainty with respect to current and future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels), considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. As pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases, their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their 
 13

 seeking of a lease modification with us. Any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges. Certain other tenants are entitled to modify the economic or other terms of, or terminate, their existing leases with us in the event of such closures. Additionally, corporate merger or consolidation activity among department stores and other national retailers typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. If a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store, at attractive rates, or at all. Additionally, department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse economic conditions or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties. We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies. Bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations. Although we have not seen an increase in tenant bankruptcies in the last two years, in previous years a number of companies in the retail industry, including certain of our tenants, declared bankruptcy, especially during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner. A bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant, and bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or from their property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. In addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. If a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. If a lease is rejected, the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. In addition, we may make lease modifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations, may require a substantial redevelopment of its space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-tenanting of its space difficult and costly. Any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties. Future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us. Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us. Certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may continue to experience, and other properties may commence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. Among other causes, (1) there has historically been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers, as well as store closures, and (2) there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise, with each of (1) and (2) accelerating as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all. We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic. Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. Tenant preferences

Table of Contents 
 for properties may also change over time, like recent trends towards right-sizing portfolios, repositioning space and locations and pursuing new store concepts, and our properties may no longer align with such preferences. If we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties, our properties may not appeal to the communities they serve. If we elect to pursue a mixed use redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each non-retail use (e.g. office, residential, hotel and entertainment), and the performance of our retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening and/or the performance of such non-retail uses. Additionally, an oversupply of retail properties in the broader market could reduce market rents, negatively impacting the terms upon which we lease our properties. To the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected. Acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity and actual or threatened terrorist attacks could adversely affect our business operations. Because our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest and criminal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that may be beyond our control or ability to prevent. If any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face material damage physically and reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively impacted. Consumers may also perceive a heightened threat of these risks due to increased crime in certain markets and negative media attention. Concern around safety risk may impact the willingness of consumers, tenants and tenants employees to shop and/or work at our properties, which could result in decreased consumer traffic and decreased sales at our properties, directly and indirectly impacting our revenue and overall asset value. We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits. Our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other types of retail properties such as single user freestanding discounters (Costco, Walmart and Target). In addition, many of our tenants are omni-channel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales and provide options to consumers like buy online pick up in store, buy online ship to store or buy online return to store. Our business currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits. The increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to web-based shopping, and the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread significantly increased the utilization of e-commerce and may, particularly in certain market segments, accelerate the long-term penetration of pure online retail. Although a brick-and-mortar presence may have a positive impact on retailers online sales, the increased utilization of pure online shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. Additionally, the increase in online shopping may result in certain tenants underreporting sales at our properties which may materially and adversely impact our collection of overage rent. Examples may include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up sales or online sales fulfilled with store inventory, and tenants reducing store sales by including online returns processed in the store. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and governmental reactions thereto, as well as other future epidemics, pandemics or public health crises, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and resurgences or variants or other epidemics, pandemics or health crises could have, a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world and an adverse impact on economic activity in retail real estate. Although consumer activity has been normalizing, there is no guarantee that retail will return to or remain at pre-pandemic levels. Governments and other authorities could respond to a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other epidemics, pandemics and public health crises, by imposing or re-imposing measures intended to control the spread of disease, including restrictions on freedom of movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. Although we believe any such measures would likely be more moderate than those imposed at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic given the consequences of stricter measures, any restrictions could negatively impact us, our tenants and consumer behavior.

Table of Contents 
 Demand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases, and the willingness of customers to visit our properties. Even without strict governmental restrictions, the willingness of consumers to visit our properties may be reduced and our tenants businesses adversely affected, based upon many factors, including local transmission rates of disease, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution, effectiveness and acceptance of existing and new vaccines, the effectiveness and availability of cures or treatments, and overall sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of diseases. In addition, some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants businesses were, and may be in the future, heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics, pandemics or public health crises, and governmental reactions thereto, on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors, including: the financial condition and viability of our tenants, and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full; state, local, federal and industry-initiated tenant relief efforts that may adversely affect landlords, including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent; the increased popularity and utilization of e-commerce; our ability to renew leases or re-lease available space in our properties on favorable terms or at all, including as a result of a deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we own properties or due to restrictions intended to prevent the spread of disease, including any additional government mandated closures of businesses that frustrate our leasing activities; a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, all of which were experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and which may affect our or our tenants ability to access capital necessary to fund our or their respective business operations or repay, refinance or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, on attractive terms, or at all and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our and our tenants ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements; a refusal or failure of one or more lenders under our credit facility to fund their respective financing commitment to us may affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our business operations and to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements; a reduction in the cash flows generated by our properties and the values of our properties that could result in impairments or limit our ability to dispose of them at attractive prices or obtain debt financing secured by our properties; the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in our tenants supply chains from local and international suppliers and/or delays in the delivery of our tenants inventory, any of which could reduce or eliminate our tenants sales, cause the temporary closure of our tenants businesses, and/or result in their bankruptcy or insolvency; a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending caused by high unemployment levels, reduced economic activity or a severe or prolonged recession; our and our tenants ability to manage our respective businesses to the extent our and their management or personnel (including on-site employees) are impacted in significant numbers or are otherwise not willing, available or allowed to conduct work, including any impact on our tenants ability to deliver timely information to us that is necessary for us to make effective decisions; and our and our tenants ability to ensure business continuity in the event our or our tenants continuity of operations plan is (i) not effective or improperly implemented or deployed or (ii) compromised due to increased cyber and remote access activity during such epidemic, pandemic or other public health crisis.

 To the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. Risks Related to Real Estate Holdings and Operations Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. A number of our properties are located in areas subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, tornados, hail or tsunamis. In 2023, the weather phenomenon known as El Nino has returned. This phenomenon generally results in an increase in storms, flooding, and landslides in Southern California, heavier precipitation along the Gulf of Mexico, and an increase in severe weather in Florida. The occurrence of natural disasters at any of our properties, which could become more intense and more volatile in light of climate change, can adversely impact operations and development/redevelopment projects at our properties, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact our tenants and the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, we could be materially and adversely affected. Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance. We maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States as well as cyber coverage. The initial portion of coverage, excess of policy deductibles, not provided by third-party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us. A third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide, if required, evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier s policy. A similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations. There are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles. Additionally, insurance costs and availability may be impacted in the future by factors outside of our control, like inflationary pressures or cybersecurity events. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property. We currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an all risk basis in the amount of up to 1 billion. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales. We face risks associated with climate change. Due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change, our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, climate change could result in population migration or volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks. Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with green building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties. As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful. Many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment), and as a result we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances. We may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 by the parties in connection with any such substances. The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, and related liabilities, may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate the related contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral. Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot assure you that: previous environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities; any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities. 
 We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties, and these activities are subject to various risks. Acquisition or construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable, and development, redevelopment or expansions may take considerably longer than expected, delaying the commencement and amount of income from the property. These risks, and the potential impact thereof, may be exacerbated by the volume and complexity of such activity, as well as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, like those experienced in 2022. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected, impacting our anticipated return on investment. We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following: we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, or at all; we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals; occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be accretive; we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores, anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld; development, redevelopment or expansions may fail to appeal to the demographics of the communities they are intended to serve; and acquisitions of new properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. If a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property s financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project. In the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties, we could be materially and adversely affected. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. If we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period, or at all, or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment. Moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. Risks Relating to Income Taxes and REIT Rules Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs in the United States. The failure to maintain Simon s or the Subsidiary REITs qualifications as REITs or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences. In the United States, Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that Simon and these subsidiaries, or the Subsidiary REITs, have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in this manner. However, qualification and taxation as REITs depend upon the ability of Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to satisfy several requirements (some of which are outside our control), including tests related to our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. The various REIT qualification tests required by the Internal Revenue Code are highly technical and complex. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. If Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs fail to comply with those provisions, Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as REITs. If such events occur, and if available relief provisions do not apply: Simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income; Simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to corporate-level income tax on taxable income at the corporate rate; Simon may be subject to the one-percent excise tax on stock repurchases imposed by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act; Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018; and unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, Simon or any such subsidiary will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. 
 Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. In addition, if Simon fails to qualify as a REIT, it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Moreover, a failure by any subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that has elected to be taxed as a REIT to qualify as a REIT could also cause Simon to fail to qualify as a REIT, and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders. Failure by Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, which could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments. We currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions. Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly. If the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. We believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner s share of its income. We cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not challenge the status of the Operating Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us. Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. To qualify to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of their respective assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and real estate assets (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of their respective investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. Additionally, in general, no more than 5 of the value of Simon s and the Subsidiary REITs total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20 of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders. Moreover, if Simon or the Subsidiary REITs are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset, income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to lenders, Simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to REITs or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions. In addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as REITs, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of their respective income, the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares. We might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as REITs. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments. Our ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm s-length terms. We own securities in TRSs and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100 excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. A REIT s ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5 or 10 asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more than 25 of the value of Simon s or any Subsidiary REIT s total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75 asset test, and not more than 20 of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 REIT owns will be less than 25 (or, in the case of securities of TRSs, 20 of the value of Simon s or such subsidiary s total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm s-length terms to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above. Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares. Income from qualified dividends payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20 of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6 assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37 maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock. The tax imposed on REITs engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination (unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors), and no guarantee can be given that the IRS, would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan. In order for Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to qualify to be taxed as REITs, and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied, Simon and each such Subsidiary REIT generally must distribute at least 90 of their respective REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to their respective equity holders each year. To the extent that Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a REIT, but distributes less than 100 of its REIT taxable income, Simon or such subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount. We intend to make distributions to the equity holders of Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. From time to time, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. If Simon or the Subsidiary REITs do not have other funds available in these situations, Simon or such subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms (the receipt of which cannot be assured), sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective REIT taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity. Further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.

 Partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us. Under the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships, subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner s distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Absent available elections, it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though Simon and the Subsidiary REITs, as REITs, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly. The partnership tax audit rules apply to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us. Legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs, including positions taken by the IRS, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the IRS and the Treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us and our investors. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and us. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership to qualify to be taxed as REITs and/or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification. Moreover, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. Provisions in Simon s charter and by-laws and in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement could prevent a change of control. Simon s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8 of its capital stock. The charter permits the members of the Simon family and related persons to own up to 18 of Simon s capital stock. Ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares, voting power or value controlled. Simon s Board of Directors may, by majority vote, permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where Simon s Board of Directors determines that Simon s ability to qualify as a REIT will not be jeopardized. These restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of Simon s stockholders or the Operating Partnership s unitholders or preferred unitholders. Other provisions of Simon s charter and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of Simon s stockholders or the Operating Partnership s unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests. These include provisions preventing holders of Simon s common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of Class B common stock. In addition, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for Simon, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, to, among other matters, engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets. Risks Related to Indebtedness and the Financial Markets We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and debt issuance costs, totaled 25.0 billion. As a result of this indebtedness, we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service, including selected repayment at scheduled maturities, which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business. We are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us, 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and market conditions. In addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. If any of the foregoing occurs, we could be materially and adversely affected. The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely. We have a variety of unsecured debt, including the Credit Facilities, senior unsecured notes and commercial paper, and secured property level debt. Certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions. In addition, certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including certain coverage ratios. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us. In addition, our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. We depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business, execute on our business model, and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit ratings, the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. An economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets. We rely upon the Credit Facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions. Our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the Credit Facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. When markets are volatile, access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us. The failure of one or more participants to the Credit Facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us, including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and/or meeting our debt service requirements. Additionally, a high interest rate environment, as we are currently experiencing, could prevent us from accessing capital at attractive interest rates, which could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt at maturity as well as our ability to fund development and/or opportunistic acquisition activities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business, execution on our business model or to meet our debt service requirements, or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms. The Operating Partnership s outstanding senior unsecured notes, the Credit Facilities, the Commercial Paper program, and Simon s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit ratings, including actual changes and changes in outlook, or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.3 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future. When interest rates increase, then so does the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flows and our 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. We selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. Risks Related to Joint Ventures We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them. As of December 31, 2022, we owned interests in 100 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the equity method of accounting to the other 82 properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in Kl pierre (a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company), The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, and Jamestown, as well as our investments in certain entities involved in retail operations, such as J.C. Penney and SPARC Group; intellectual property and licensing venture, such as Authentic Brands Group, LLC, or ABG; and an e-commerce venture Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG, (collectively, our other platform investments). We serve as general partner or property manager for 51 of these 82 joint venture properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling, refinancing, and redeveloping the properties, require the consent of the other owners. Of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 24 are in our international joint ventures. These international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner. The other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties assets. The remaining joint venture properties, Kl pierre, TRG, Jamestown, and our joint ventures with ABG, J.C. Penney, RGG, and SPARC Group are managed by third parties. These investments, and other future similar investments, could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. If one of our partners or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt, we may be precluded from taking certain actions regarding our investments without prior court approval, which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might want to take. Additionally, partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. These investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale, financing or development, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent Simon s officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners. The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties. Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us. Nevertheless, the joint venture s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein. As of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of 128.0 million. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 under a guaranty. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise. General Risk Factors We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendor/developer selection (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional actions by employees (including the failure to follow our security protocols) and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, including making recent upgrades to our IT programs through significant capital investment, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We may also face significant disruptions due to natural disasters or other critical incidents. The risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on technology, a rise in the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks globally, and the permanent nature of remote work as business travel has resumed and people now routinely work remotely outside of normal business hours. A breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, tenants and revenues, generate third party claims, cause operational disruption, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and/or confidential information, and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. We may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers. Additionally, cyber-attacks perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and spending at our tenants, or negatively impact consumer perception of shopping at our properties, all of which could materially and adversely affect us. An increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance ESG factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. Investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of ESG factors. As they evaluate investment decisions, many investors look not only at company disclosures but also to ESG rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow ESG comparisons among companies. Although we participate in a number of these ratings systems, we do not participate in all such systems. The criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict and change frequently, and we cannot predict how these third parties will score us, nor can we have any assurance that they score us accurately or other companies accurately or that other companies have provided them with accurate data. We supplement our participation in ratings systems with published disclosures of our ESG activities, but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide. In addition, the SEC is currently evaluating potential rule making that could mandate additional ESG disclosure and impose other requirements on us. Failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors compare us to other companies, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our stock price.

 Our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations. As of December 31, 2022, we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in Austria, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We also have an equity stake in Kl pierre, a publicly traded European real estate company, which operates in 14 countries in Europe. Accordingly, our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held. While we occasionally enter into hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, these agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely. We may pursue additional investment, ownership, development and redevelopment/expansion opportunities outside the United States. Such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to: adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants supply chain and consumer spending levels; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations, taxes and litigation; the risk that we, our employees and/or agents could violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption and international trade laws in the U.S., such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which could result in criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines, negatively impact our reputation, or require us to incur significant expenses to investigate; differing lending practices; differences in cultures and consumer retail behavior; changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect international operations; changes in applicable laws and regulations in these foreign jurisdictions; difficulties in managing international operations; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; and labor discord, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, supply chain disruptions or the threat of international boycotts. 
 Our international activities represented approximately 7.7 of consolidated net income and 8.9 of our net operating income, or NOI, for the year ended December 31, 2022. To the extent that we expand our international activities, the above risks could increase in significance, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and develop talented employees, and our failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business. The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, including our CEO, who operate without the existence of employment agreements. Many of our senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry, which aid us in identifying opportunities and negotiating with tenants. Our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees, and develop talent internally, could significantly impact our future performance. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract, retain and/or develop other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. Additionally, the compensation and benefits packages we may need to offer to remain competitive for these individuals could increase the cost of replacement and retention. Losing any one or more of these persons could adversely affect our business, disrupt short-term operational performance, diminish our opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and others, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

 Item 2. Properties United States Properties Our U.S. properties primarily consist of malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, lifestyle centers and other retail properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 172.6 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA. Malls typically contain at least one department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 94 malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 270,000 to 2.7 million square feet of GLA. Premium Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 69 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to 900,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located within a close proximity to major metropolitan areas and/or tourist destinations. The 14 properties in The Mills generally range in size from 1.2 million to 2.4 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, big box retailers and entertainment uses. We also have interests in six lifestyle centers and 13 other retail properties. The lifestyle centers range in size from 170,000 to 950,000 square feet of GLA. The other retail properties range in size from approximately 200,000 to 1.6 million square feet of GLA and are considered non-core to our business model. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 94.9 of the owned GLA in malls and Premium Outlets was leased and approximately 98.2 of the owned GLA for The Mills was leased. We wholly own 130 of our properties, effectively control 11 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 55 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 188 properties in the United States. Certain of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of Operating Partnership units, to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner. We own an 80 noncontrolling interest in TRG, which has an interest in 20 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. Our effective ownership in these properties, through our investment in TRG, ranges from 38.8 to 80 .

We believe that our climate related risk disclosures are aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures established by the Financial Stability Board. Reducing water consumption and landfill waste are also components of reducing our carbon and environmental footprint. We have already achieved our initial target of reducing water usage by 20 , and we are working to create a new target that will focus on more efficient and responsible water use in the future. The Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors Board has been allocated the oversight of our sustainability policies, including environmental, social, and governance matters. Additionally, the Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the oversight and the annual disclosure of our sustainability programs in the form of an annual sustainability report. In 2022, we were once again awarded a Green Star rating (2014-2022) - the highest designation awarded for leadership in sustainability performance by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. We were also the recipient of NAREIT s Leader in the Light award for sustainability leadership in the retail property sector. Finally, we scored an A- on the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100 of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Simon mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to we, us and our mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon. We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets , and The Mills . As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held an interest in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 94 malls, 69 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80 noncontrolling interest in The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at several properties in the North America, Europe and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2022, we had ownership in 34 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, we also owned a 22.4 equity stake in Kl pierre SA, or Kl pierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe. We generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants including consideration received from: fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements, and variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items. 
 Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed. We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following: attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses, expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates, selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets, generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and selling selective non-core assets. 
 We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities: establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,

 offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services, selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as outlots or outparcels, and 
 generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities . 
 We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties. We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk. To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy: provide the capital necessary to fund growth, maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, including but not limited to, having in place, the Operating Partnership s 4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, its 3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or its Supplemental Facility, together, the Credit Facilities and its global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial Paper program, of 2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof, and manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings. 
 We consider FFO, comparable FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and portfolio NOI to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included below in this discussion. COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in properties, have at times imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these measures, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties and investments. Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter. As we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread on our business, our primary focus has been on the health and safety of our employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve. In the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the property closures, we implemented a series of actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity in light of the economic impacts of the pandemic, including: significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending, significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend, implemented a temporary furlough of certain corporate and field employees due to the closure of the Company s U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and

 suspended more than 1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects. As the economic environment has recovered from the pandemic, our operations have returned to more normalized pre-pandemic levels with respect to our operating expenses and capital spend. Results Overview Diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased 0.32 during 2022 to 6.52 as compared to 6.84 in 2021. The decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to: a non-cash gain in 2021 on acquisitions and disposals of 203.4 million, or 0.54 per diluted share/unit, related to the disposition of our interest in three properties of 176.8 million, or 0.47 per diluted share/unit, a non-cash gain on the consolidation of one property of 3.7 million, or 0.01 per diluted share/unit, and net gains of 21.0 million, or 0.06 per diluted share/unit, related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets, primarily due to hurricane, flood and wind storm damage, a gain in 2021 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests of 178.7 million, or 0.48 per diluted share/unit, of which 159.8 million, or 0.43 per diluted share/unit, was non-cash, decreased income from unconsolidated entities of 134.9 million, or 0.36 per diluted share/unit, the majority of which is due to unfavorable year-over-year operations from our other platform investments as well as the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability at Kl pierre in 2021 resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was 118.4 million, which is partially offset by improved operations and core fundamentals in our other unconsolidated entities and TRG, an unrealized unfavorable change in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments of 53.1 million, or 0.14 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by a non-cash gain in 2022 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net of 121.2 million, or 0.32 per diluted share/unit, decreased tax expense of 73.7 million, or 0.20 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year operations from other platform investments and a favorable 32.0 million tax impact created by the lower gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests transactions noted above, decreased interest expense in 2022 of 34.5 million, or 0.09 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to the early extinguishment of nine secured loans in the fourth quarter of 2021, the disposition of three retail properties in 2021, and the refinancing of two retail properties at lower interest rates in 2021, partially offset by an increase in interest rates as further discussed below, a charge on early extinguishment of debt of 51.8 million, or 0.14 per diluted share/unit, in 2021 , and improved operating performance and solid core business fundamentals in 2022, as discussed below, and the impact of our acquisition, development and expansion activity. 
 Portfolio NOI increased 5.7 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 2.3 to 55.13 psf as of December 31, 2022, from 53.91 psf as of December 31, 2021. Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 1.5 to 94.9 as of December 31, 2022, from 93.4 as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to leasing activity, partially offset by 2021 tenant bankruptcy activity. Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2022 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 36 basis points to 3.22 as compared to 2.86 at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 273 basis points (3.93 at December 31, 2022 as compared to 1.20 at December 31, 2021) offset by a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 13 basis points (3.15 at December 31, 2022 as compared to 3.28 at December 31, 2021). The weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 7.5 years and 7.8 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our financing activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 included: increasing our Euro denominated borrowings by 750.0 million 779.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent as of the issuance date) under the Supplemental Facility, and using the proceeds to repay 750.0 million 777.1 million U.S. dollar equivalent as of the payoff date) of senior unsecured notes at maturity,

 decreasing our borrowings under the Operating Partnership s global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial Paper program, by 500.0 million, and completing on January 11, 2022, the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: 500 million with a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 43 basis points and 700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.650 , with maturity dates of January 11, 2024 and February 1, 2032, respectively. The proceeds were used to repay 1.05 billion outstanding under the Supplemental Facility, on January 12, 2022. 
 United States Portfolio Data The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy, and average base minimum rent per square foot. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. For comparative information purposes, we separate the information related to The Mills and TRG from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any information for properties located outside the United States. The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets: properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements, properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.

 Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot. Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy. Current Leasing Activities During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 9.1 million square feet, of which 7.0 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2021, we signed 992 new leases and 1,460 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 8.3 million square feet, of which 6.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was 55.41 per square foot in 2022 and 55.90 per square foot in 2021 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of 53.01 per square foot

The information used to prepare these statistics has been supplied by the managing venture partner.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines in such conditions due to, or amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic. When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including, among other things, the timing of a tenant s bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the Company s properties on substantially similar terms. In the event that we determine accrued receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and straight-line rent receivable charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination. 
 We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property s operational performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company s intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization during the anticipated holding period plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less than their carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. Our evaluation of changes in economic or operating conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include developing estimates of fair value, forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization. We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such as operating income, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or

 relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments are other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results. To maintain Simon s status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90 of REIT taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact Simon s REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain Simon s REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period Simon did not qualify as a REIT. If Simon lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods. In the period of a significant acquisition of real estate, we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of asset acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our real estate valuations are typically the determination of relative fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants ability to pay rents based upon the tenants operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.

 For the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, comparable refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year to year comparisons. Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2021 Lease income increased 168.5 million, of which the property transactions accounted for a 23.2 million decrease. Comparable lease income increased 191.7 million, or 4.1 . Total lease income increased primarily due to an increase in fixed lease income of 156.6 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease consideration, higher occupancy, and an increase in variable lease income of 11.9 million primarily related to higher consideration based on tenant sales. Total other income decreased 4.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in lease settlement income of 38.8 million, a 14.9 million gain from the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property in 2021, and a 6.8 million non-cash dilution gain on a non-retail investment in 2021, partially offset by an 20.8 million increase in fee and other income, a 17.9 million increase related to Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues, a 9.8 million increase related to land sale activity and a 7.8 million increase in interest income. Property operating expenses increased 48.4 million primarily due to the return to a more normalized operating environment following the peak of the COVID pandemic. Other expense increased 11.7 million primarily due to an increase in legal fees and foreign currency revaluations. Interest expense decreased 34.5 million primarily related to the early extinguishment of nine secured loans, the disposition of three retail properties, and the refinancing of two retail properties at lower interest rates in 2021, partially

 offset by the issuances of Euro and USD bonds and interest increases due to variable rates in 2022. During 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 51.8 million as a result of the early redemption of unsecured notes and the payoff of mortgages at nine properties. During 2022, we recorded a 159.0 million non-cash gain as a result of the sale to ABG of all of our interests in the Eddie Bauer licensing venture for additional interests in ABG, partially offset by a loss of 37.8 million on the revaluation or disposal of other investments. During 2021, we recorded a non-cash gain of 159.8 million as a result of the sale to ABG of all of our interests in the licensing ventures of Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers for additional interests in ABG and a gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in ABG of 18.8 million, as discussed further in Note 6. Income and other tax expense decreased 73.7 million due to the impact in 2021 on deferred tax expense as a result of the ABG transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of 55.9 million, offset by the impact in 2022 on deferred tax expense of the 2022 ABG transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of 39.7 million, and lower tax expense in 2022 on our share of operating results from our other platform investments. Income from unconsolidated entities decreased 134.9 million primarily due to unfavorable results of operations year over year from our other platform investments of 216.1 million, as well as the reversal in 2021 of a previously established deferred tax liability at Kl pierre resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was 118.4 million, partially offset by favorable year over year results of operations across the properties and TRG in 2022. During 2022, we recorded a 19.9 million gain on the disposition of one unconsolidated property, a 2.1 million gain related to excess insurance proceeds and a 1.3 million gain on the disposition of certain assets by Kl pierre, partially offset by a 17.7 million loss primarily related to the disposition of one consolidated property. During 2021, we recorded gains of 184.0 million related to the disposition of three consolidated properties, our interest in one unconsolidated property and the impact from the consolidation of one property that was previously unconsolidated, and gains of 21.2 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets. Simon s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 6.2 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership. Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2020 Lease income increased 434.4 million, of which the property transactions accounted for a 17.6 million decrease. Comparable lease income increased 452.0 million, or 10.6 . Total lease income increased primarily due to an increase in variable lease income of 603.8 million primarily related to higher consideration based on tenant sales and lower negative variable lease income due to abatements granted in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in fixed minimum lease and CAM consideration recorded on a straight-line basis of 169.4 million. Total other income increased 65.3 million, primarily due to an increase in lease settlement income of 39.8 million, a 14.9 million gain on the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property, an 11.5 million increase related to Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues, a 6.8 million increase from the non-cash dilution gain on a non-retail investment, and a 3.3 million net increase in dividend, interest and other income, partially offset by a 7.8 million decrease related to higher land and outparcel sale activity in 2020, and a 3.2 million decrease related to business interruption proceeds received in 2020. Property operating expenses increased 66.6 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed. Repairs and maintenance expenses increased 15.5 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.

General and administrative expense increased 7.8 million primarily due to an increase in compensation. Other expense increased 2.8 million primarily due to an increase in the write-off of development projects we are no longer intending to pursue, partially offset by a decrease related to legal fees.

 During 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 51.8 million as a result of the early redemption of unsecured notes and the payoff of mortgages at nine properties. During 2021, we recorded gains on sale or exchange of equity interests of 178.7 million as a result of the contribution to ABG of all of our interests in the licensing ventures of Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers in exchange for additional interests in ABG and the sale of a portion of our interest in ABG, as discussed further in Note 6. Income and other tax (expense) benefit increased 161.8 million due to increased deferred tax expense as a result of the ABG transactions noted above which had a non-cash tax impact of 55.9 million and 92.1 million related to strong operating performance of our other platform investments as well as earnings from our acquisition of an interest in certain retailers throughout 2020. Income from unconsolidated entities increased 563.0 million primarily due to favorable results of operations from our other platform investments, including earnings from our acquisition of an interest in J.C. Penney in the later part of 2020, and international investments which included the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability at Kl pierre resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was 118.4 million, partially offset by amortization of our excess investment in TRG. During 2021, we recorded gains of 184.0 million related to the disposition of three consolidated properties, our interest in one unconsolidated property and the impact from the consolidation of one property that was previously unconsolidated, and gains of 21.2 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets. During 2020, we recorded 125.6 million of impairment charges related to one consolidated property, an other-than-temporary impairment on our equity investment in three joint venture properties, an other-than-temporary impairment to reduce an investment to its estimated fair value, and a 4.3 million loss, net, related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets by Kl pierre, partially offset by a 12.3 million gain on the disposal of our interest in one consolidated property, a 1.9 million excess gain on insurance proceeds related to our two properties in Puerto Rico and a 1.0 million gain related to the disposition of a shopping center by one of our joint venture investments. Simon s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 154.3 million due to an increase in the net income of the Operating Partnership. Liquidity and Capital Resources Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised 9.0 of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2022. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled 4.2 billion in the aggregate during 2022. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased 87.7 million during 2022 to 621.6 million as of December 31, 2022 as further discussed below. On December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately 6.6 billion under the Facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of 927.8 million and letters of credit of 10.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities was 1.2 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was 260.7 million. The weighted average interest rate was 2.15 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level. Our business model and Simon s status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2023.

 Cash Flows Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled 4.2 billion during 2022. In addition, we had net repayments of debt from our debt financing and repayment activities of 0.3 billion in 2022. These activities are further discussed below under Financing and Debt. During 2022, we also: funded the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in Jamestown for cash consideration of 173.4 million, paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately 2.6 billion and preferred unit distributions totaling 5.3 million, funded consolidated capital expenditures of 650.0 million (including development and other costs of 108.2 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of 282.5 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of 259.3 million), funded investments in unconsolidated entities of 235.8 million, and funded the repurchase of 180.4 million of Simon s common stock. 
 In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners necessary to maintain Simon s REIT qualification on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital: excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves, borrowings on the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or additional equity raised in the public or private markets. 
 We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2023, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations, could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing. Financing and Debt Unsecured Debt At December 31, 2022, our unsecured debt consisted of 18.6 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, 125.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, and 802.8 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Euro-denominated borrowings outstanding under the Supplemental Facility. The Credit Facility also included an additional single, delayed-draw 2.0 billion term loan facility, or Term Facility, or together with the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility, the Credit Facilities, which the Operating Partnership drew on December 15, 2020, and repaid in 2021.

The Supplemental Facility s borrowing capacity of 3.5 billion may be increased to 4.5 billion during its term and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 100 of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined.

Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. On December 31, 2022 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of 6.6 billion under the Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.2 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was 260.7 million. Letters of credit of 10.0 million were outstanding under the Facilities as of December 31, 2022. The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program of 2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. Notes will be sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities, and if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under the Commercial Paper program. Borrowings under the Commercial Paper program reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities. On January 21, 2021 the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: 800 million with a fixed interest rate of 1.750 , and 700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.20 , with maturity dates of February 2028 and 2031, respectively.

This interest rate swap matures on January 17, 2024. Mortgage Debt Total mortgage indebtedness was 5.5 billion and 5.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Covenants Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt. At December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 38 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 41 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At December 31, 2022, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

(2) Variable rate interest payments are estimated based on the LIBOR or other applicable rate at December 31, 2022. (3) Represents contractual commitments for capital projects and services at December 31, 2022. Our share of estimated 2023 development, redevelopment and expansion activity is further discussed below under Development Activity . (4) Represents only the minimum non-cancellable lease period, excluding applicable lease extension and renewal options, unless reasonably certain of exercise. 
 Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured non-recourse debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of 128.0 million. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise. Hurricane Impacts As discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, during the third quarter of 2017, two of our wholly-owned properties located in Puerto Rico sustained significant property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria. Since the date of the loss, we have received 84.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers related to the two properties located in Puerto Rico, of which 48.3 million was used for property restoration and remediation and to reduce the insurance recovery receivable. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded 2.1 million

 and 5.2 million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Texas experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Hanna. We wrote-off assets of approximately 9.6 million, and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received 14.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers. The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a 3.5 million gain related to property insurance recovery of previously depreciated assets. This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net. During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Laura. We wrote-off assets of approximately 11.1 million and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received 27.5 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers. The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a 17.5 million gain related to property insurance recovery of previously depreciated assets. This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net. Acquisitions and Dispositions Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner s interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities. Acquisitions. On June 17, 2022, we acquired an additional interest in Gloucester Premium Outlets from a joint venture partner for 14.0 million in cash consideration, including a pro-rata share of working capital, resulting in the consolidation of this property. The property is subject to an 85.7 million 3.29 variable rate mortgage loan. We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all of our investment has been determined to relate to investment property. The Company sponsored, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a special purpose acquisition corporation, or SPAC, named Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc. On February 18, 2021 the SPAC announced the pricing of its initial public offering, which was consummated on February 23, 2021, generating gross proceeds of 345.0 million. The SPAC was a consolidated VIE which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination and was targeting innovative businesses that operate within Simon s Live, Work, Play, Stay, Shop ecosystem. In January 2020, we acquired additional interests of 5.05 and 1.37 in SPARC Group and ABG, respectively, for 6.7 million and 33.5 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, SPARC acquired certain assets and operations of Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brands out of bankruptcy. At September 30, 2020, our noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group and in ABG were 50.0 and 6.8 , respectively. Dispositions. We may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area. In December 2022, the SPAC was liquidated and dissolved. In connection with this event, we recorded a loss of 10.2 million, representing our sponsor investment in the SPAC. During 2022, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. The proceeds from this transaction were 59.0 million, resulting in a loss of 15.6 million. We also recorded a non-cash gain of 19.9 million related to the disposition of one unconsolidated retail property in satisfaction of its 99.6 million non-recourse mortgage loan. These are included in a gain on acquisitions of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interest in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. During 2021, we recorded net gains of 176.8 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the foreclosure of three consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their respective 180.0 million, 120.9 million and 100.0

 million non-recourse mortgage loans. We also disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated property resulting in a gain of 3.4 million. Joint Venture Formation Activity and Other Investment Activity On December 19, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a 50 noncontrolling legal ownership interest in Jamestown, a global real estate investment and asset management company, as well as separate interests in certain real estate and working capital, for total cash consideration of 173.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we sold to ABG our interests in the licensing venture of Eddie Bauer for additional interests in ABG. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain of 159.0 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the interests received and the 98.8 million carrying value of the intellectual property licensing venture less costs to sell. On July 1, 2021, we sold to ABG all of our interests in both the Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers licensing ventures for additional interests in ABG. As a result, in the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain of 159.8 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the interests received and the 102.7 million carrying value of the intellectual property licensing ventures less costs to sell. On December 20, 2021, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG, resulting in a pre-tax gain of 18.8 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of 8.0 million which is included in income and other tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Subsequently, we acquired additional interests in ABG for cash consideration of 100.0 million. At December 31, 2022, our interest in ABG was approximately 12.3 . During the first quarter of 2022, SPARC Group acquired certain assets and operations of Reebok and entered into a long-term strategic partnership with ABG to become the core licensee and operating partner for Reebok in the United States. On June 1, 2021, we and our partner, ABG, acquired the intellectual property of Eddie Bauer. Our noncontrolling interest in the licensing venture is 49 and was acquired for cash consideration of 100.8 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we and our partner, ABG, each acquired additional 12.5 interests in the licensing and operations of Forever 21, our share of which was 56.3 million, bringing our interest to 50 . Subsequently the Forever 21 operations were merged into SPARC Group. On December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an 80 ownership interest in TRG, which has an ownership interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Under the terms of the transaction, we, through the Operating Partnership, acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc. common stock for 43.00 per share in cash. Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of Taubman s 192.5 million 6.5 Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its 170.0 million 6.25 Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, and the issuance of 955,705 Operating Partnership units, was approximately 3.5 billion. Our investment includes the 6.38 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for 362.5 million issued to us. On December 7, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of J.C. Penney, a department store retailer, out of bankruptcy. Our noncontrolling interest in the venture is 41.67 and was acquired for cash consideration of 125.0 million. On February 19, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Forever 21, a retailer of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy. The interests were acquired through two separate joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our noncontrolling interest in each of the retail operations venture and in the licensing venture is 37.5 . Our aggregate investment in the ventures was 67.6 million. In connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase gain of which our share of 35.0 million pre-tax is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. During 2020, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross proceeds on this transaction of 33.4 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage. Our share of the 12.3 million gain is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Development Activity We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants are underway at several properties in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Table of Contents 
 Construction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and internationally that are nearing completion. Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately 980 million. Simon s share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately 239 million. We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. We seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 7-10 for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects. Summary of Capital Expenditures. The following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 New Developments 108 96 27 Redevelopments and Expansions 283 300 399 Tenant Allowances 207 127 53 Operational Capital Expenditures 52 5 5 Total 650 528 484 International Development Activity We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2023 or 2024 is 199 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans. The following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):

 Dividends, Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program Simon paid a common stock dividend of 1.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 6.90 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts.

The distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, Simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends. Simon s future dividends and the Operating Partnership s future distributions will be determined by Simon s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain Simon s status as a REIT. On May 9, 2022, Simon s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan. Under the plan, Simon may repurchase up to 2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period commencing on May 16, 2022 and ending

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this press release may be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company s actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment, including but not limited to those caused by inflation, recessionary pressures, wars, such as in Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions; the inability to renew leases and relet vacant space at existing properties on favorable terms; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the potential for violence, civil unrest, criminal activity or terrorist activities at our properties; natural disasters; the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, including e-commerce; security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; the increased focus on ESG metrics and reporting; environmental liabilities; our international activities subjecting us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in foreign exchange rates; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion, leasing and management of properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties on favorable terms; the loss of key management personnel; uncertainties regarding the impact of pandemics, epidemics or public health crises, and the associated governmental restrictions on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity; changes in market rates of interest; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations, including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; risks relating to our joint venture properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; and general risks related to real estate investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading Risk Factors in Part 1, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, comparable FFO, diluted FFO per share, NOI, and portfolio NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio. We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper 2018 Restatement. Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate. Gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO. We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP: excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties, 
 75 

Table of Contents 
 plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 You should understand that our computations of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures: do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and are not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. 
 The following schedule reconciles total FFO and comparable FFO to consolidated net income and, for Simon, diluted net income per share to diluted FFO per share.

 Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes. We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, primarily SOFR and LIBOR. Based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2022, a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 11.5 million, and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 721.7 million.

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Simon Property Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ February 23, 2023

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company s consolidated net investment properties totaled 21.8 billion. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of an investment property may not be recoverable. The Company estimates undiscounted cash flows of an investment property using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated capitalization rates, leasing prospects and local market information.

Table of Contents 
 Auditing management s evaluation of investment properties for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the undiscounted cash flows of an investment property. In particular, the impairment evaluation for investment properties was sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process for evaluating investment properties for impairment, including controls over management s review of the significant assumptions described above. To test the Company s evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization to historical actual results and evaluated significant variances, including consideration of the current economic environment. As part of our evaluation, we assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in the assumptions. Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated entities and its investments in Kl pierre and TRG totaled 8.1 billion. As explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated entity may not be recoverable. To identify and evaluate whether an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value has occurred, the Company assesses economic and operating conditions that may affect the fair value of the investment. The evaluation of operating conditions may include developing estimates of forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization to support the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment. When required, the Company estimates the fair value of an investment and assesses whether any impairment is other than temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. Auditing management s evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated fair value of the investment and whether any decline in fair value below the related investment s carrying amount is other-than-temporary. In particular, the impairment evaluation for these investments was sensitive to significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, relevant market multiples, and capitalization and discount rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process for evaluating investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment, including controls over management s review of the significant assumptions described above.

Buildings and improvements Total land, buildings and improvements Furniture, fixtures and equipment Investment properties at cost Less accumulated depreciation Investment properties at cost, net Construction in progress included above We record investment properties at cost. Investment properties include costs of acquisitions; development, predevelopment, and construction (including allocable salaries and related benefits); tenant allowances and improvements; and interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. We capitalize improvements and replacements from repair and maintenance when the repair and maintenance extends the useful life, increases capacity, or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. We capitalize interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects are ready for their intended purpose based on interest rates in place during the construction period. The amount of interest capitalized during each year is as follows: We record depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated original useful life, which is generally to . We review depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and we make adjustments when necessary to reflect a shorter economic life. We amortize tenant allowances and tenant improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. We record depreciation on equipment and fixtures utilizing the straight-line method over seven to . We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable.

Changes in the fair value of these equity instruments are recorded in unrealized losses in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments, net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had equity instruments without readily determinable fair values of million and million, respectively, for which we have elected the measurement alternative. We regularly evaluate these investments for any impairment in their estimated fair value, as well as any observable price changes for an identical or similar equity instrument of the same issuer. We recorded a reduction in the carrying value of these investments of million and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these equity instruments are recorded in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Our deferred compensation plan equity instruments are valued based upon quoted market prices. The investments have a matching liability as the amounts are fully payable to the employees that earned the compensation. Changes in value of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both recognized in earnings and, as a result, there is no impact to consolidated net income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held debt securities of million and million, respectively, in our captive insurance subsidiary. The types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiary are typically U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as well as corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from less than to . These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based upon quoted market prices or other observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance subsidiary is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Changes in the values of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the gain or loss is realized or until any unrealized loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and duration of any decline in value. To the extent an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment is recorded and a new cost basis is established. Our captive insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be limited.

The equity instruments with readily determinable fair values we held at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily classified as having Level 1 fair value inputs. In addition, we had derivative instruments which were classified as having Level 2 inputs, which consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate cap and swap agreements with a gross asset balance of million at December 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021, and a gross liability balance of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt.

 million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Within the next year, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately million of gains related to terminated interest rate swaps from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposers, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposers. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes. We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments which are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Yen and Euro. We use currency forward contracts, cross currency swap contracts, and nonderivative instruments such as foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and Euro-denominated receivables and net investments. Currency forward contracts involve fixing the Yen:USD or Euro:USD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward contracts are typically cash settled in U.S. dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. We had the following Euro:USD forward contracts designated as net investment hedges at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): March 15, 2022 September 15, 2022 September 15, 2022 ) September 15, 2022 ) December 16, 2022 ) January 13, 2023 ) March 15, 2023 March 15, 2023 December 15, 2023 ) March 15, 2024 March 15, 2024 ) April 12, 2023 ) September 15, 2023 ) Asset balances in the above table are included in deferred costs and other assets. Liability balances in the above table are included in other liabilities. We have designated certain derivative and nonderivative instruments as net investment hedges. Accordingly, we report the changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 we recorded gains (losses) of million, million, and million), respectively, in the cumulative translation adjustment section of the other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the value of these instruments are offset by changes in the underlying hedged Euro investments.

 million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the Operating Partnership s derivative activities, including our share of the other comprehensive income (loss) from unconsolidated entities, was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in properties, net Total noncontrolling interests reflected in equity Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties, limited partners interests in the Operating Partnership, and preferred distributions payable by the Operating Partnership on its outstanding preferred units) is a component of consolidated net income. In addition, the individual components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the aggregate for both controlling and noncontrolling interests, with the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests deducted from comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders. The Operating Partnership Our evaluation of the appropriateness of classifying the Operating Partnership s common units of partnership interest, or units, held by Simon and the Operating Partnership s limited partners within permanent equity considered several significant factors. First, as a limited partnership, all decisions relating to the Operating Partnership s operations and distributions are made by Simon, acting as the Operating Partnership s sole general partner. The decisions of the general partner are made by Simon s Board of Directors or management. The Operating Partnership has no other governance structure. Secondly, the sole asset of Simon is its interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, a share of common stock of Simon, or common stock, if owned by the Operating Partnership, is best characterized as being similar to a treasury share and thus not an asset of the Operating Partnership. Limited partners of the Operating Partnership have the right under the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to exchange their units for shares of common stock or cash, as selected by Simon as the sole general partner. Accordingly, we classify units held by limited partners in permanent equity because Simon may elect to issue shares of common stock to limited partners exercising their exchange rights rather than using cash. Under the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to redeem units held by Simon only when Simon has repurchased shares of common stock. We classify units held by Simon in permanent equity because the decision to redeem those units would be made by Simon. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties) is a component of consolidated net income.

If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, and if available relief provisions do not apply, Simon or that entity will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries loses its REIT status it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless the failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied. We have also elected taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, status for some of our subsidiaries. This enables us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and participate in activities that do not qualify as rents from real property . For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income. As a partnership, the allocated share of the Operating Partnership s income or loss for each year is included in the income tax returns of the partners; accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements other than as discussed above for our TRSs. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net deferred tax liabilities of million and million, respectively, which primarily relate to the temporary differences between the carrying value of balance sheet assets and liabilities and their tax bases. These differences were primarily created through the consolidation of various European assets in 2016. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets related to our TRSs, consisting of operating losses and other carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes as well as the timing of the deductibility of losses or reserves from insurance subsidiaries, though these amounts are not material to the financial statements. The deferred tax asset in included in deferred costs and other assets and the deferred tax liability is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We are also subject to certain other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, as well as income-based and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments, which are included in income and other taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

The issuance of additional classes or series of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us without further action of the stockholders. The ability to issue additional classes or series of capital stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of Simon s outstanding voting stock. Holders of common stock are entitled to vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, other than for the election of directors. The holders of Simon s Class B common stock have the right to elect up to members of Simon s Board of Directors.

Temporary Equity Simon Simon classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that Simon could be required to redeem the security for cash irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a result, Simon classifies series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.

This plan, or the 2019 Plan, provides for the grant of equity-based awards with respect to the equity of Simon in the form of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and performance-based awards. Options may be granted which are qualified as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and options which are not so qualified. An aggregate of shares of common stock have been reserved under the 2019 plan. The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee determines which eligible individuals may participate and the type, extent and terms of the awards to be granted to them. In addition, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee interprets the 2019 Plan and makes all other determinations deemed advisable for its administration. Options granted to employees become exercisable over the period determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. The exercise price of an employee option may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Employee options generally vest over a period and expire from the date of grant. Directors who are not also our employees or employees of our affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 plan.

Once vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock (including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires, dies or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to receive dividends on the underlying shares; however, any dividends on the shares of restricted stock must be reinvested in shares of common stock and held in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the shares of restricted stock are delivered to the former director. Stock Based Compensation Our long-term incentive compensation awards under our stock-based compensation plans primarily take the form of LTIP units, restricted stock units, and restricted stock. The substantial majority of these awards are market condition or performance-based, and are based on various market, corporate and business unit performance measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs, net of amounts capitalized, is included within home and regional office costs and general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive

 of the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP units as participating securities under the two class method of computing earnings per share. These are granted under The Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan. The grant date fair values of any LTIP units that are market-based awards are estimated using a Monte Carlo model, and the resulting fixed expense is recorded regardless of whether the market condition criteria are achieved if the participant performs the required service period. The grant date fair values of the market-based awards are being amortized into expense over the performance period, which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if earned, become vested. The expense of the performance-based award is recorded over the performance period, which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if earned, become vested, based on our assessment as to whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved during the applicable performance periods. The grant date fair values of any restricted stock unit awards are recognized as expense over the vesting period. 2019 LTIP Program .

All of the earned LTIP units under the 2019 LTIP Program will vest on January 1, 2023.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Simon Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Simon maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Simon s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our management, with the participation of Simon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Simon s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, Simon s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, Simon s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Simon is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Simon s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by Simon s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We assessed the effectiveness of Simon s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, Simon s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in Simon s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Simon s internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.2 DESCRIPTION OF EACH REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 SIMON PROPERTY GROUP, INC. As of December 31, 2022, Simon Property Group, Inc. had the two following classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ): (i) our common stock, 0.0001 par value per share common stock and (ii) our Series J 8 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 0.0001 par value per share Series J Preferred Stock ). The following descriptions are summaries and do not purport to be complete. The descriptions are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to our restated certificate of incorporation (the charter ), our amended and restated by-laws (the by-laws and the certificate of designations for the Series J Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designations ), each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. References in the discussion under the caption Simon Property Group, Inc. to Simon, we, our and us and similar references mean Simon Property Group, Inc. excluding, unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise expressly stated, its subsidiaries. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK Authorized Capital Stock We have the authority to issue 850,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value 0.0001 per share, consisting of the following: 511,990,000 shares of common stock, 10,000 shares of Class B common stock, 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and 238,000,000 shares of excess common stock, or Excess Stock. Common Stock and Class B Common Stock Terms of Common Stock As of December 31, 2022, there were 342,905,419 shares of common stock outstanding, which excludes the outstanding shares of Class B common stock described below and the shares of common stock held in treasury. The holders of shares of common stock: are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders, other than the election of four directors who are elected exclusively by holders of Class B common stock; 

 are not entitled to cumulative voting for the election of directors; are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors, in its discretion, from legally available assets, subject to preferential rights of holders of preferred stock; are not entitled to preemptive, subscription or conversion rights; and are not subject to further calls or assessments. The shares of common stock currently outstanding are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Terms of Class B Common Stock As of December 31, 2022, we had 8,000 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Holders of Class B common stock: are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, other than the election of four directors who are elected exclusively by the holders of Class B common stock; are not entitled to cumulative voting for the election of directors; and are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of legally available funds, subject to preferential rights of holders of preferred stock. If we are liquidated, each outstanding share of common stock and Class B common stock, including shares of Excess Stock, if any, will be entitled to participate pro rata in the assets remaining after payment of, or adequate provision for, all of our known debts and liabilities, subject to the right of the holders of preferred stock, including any excess preferred stock into which shares of such series has been converted, to receive preferential distributions. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are subject to a voting trust of which Herbert and David Simon are the voting trustees. The holders of Class B common stock are entitled to elect four of our directors. However, the number of Class B directors would decrease if the Simon family s aggregate ownership interest in us, including common stock, Class B common stock and units of limited partnership interest of Simon Property Group, L.P. considered on an as-converted basis, decreases to less than 50 of their aggregate ownership interest as of August 9, 1996. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at the holder s option into an equal number of shares of common stock. Shares of Class B common stock also convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the sale or transfer thereof to a person not affiliated with the Simon family or if the Simon family s aggregate ownership interest declines to specified levels. Holders of shares of common stock and Class B common stock have no sinking fund rights, redemption rights or preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities. 

 Subject to any separate rights of holders of preferred stock or as described below, any vacancies on the board of directors resulting from death, disability, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or other cause of a director shall be filled by a vote of the stockholders or a majority of the directors then in office provided, however, that any vacancy relating to a director elected by the Class B common stock is to be filled by the holders of the Class B common stock. The charter provides that, subject to the right of holders of any class or series separately entitled to elect one or more directors, if any such right has been granted, directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Transfer Agent Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent for our common stock. Delaware Law and Certain Charter and By-law Provisions Our charter and by-laws and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder would consider in its best interest. This includes an attempt that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. These provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. They are also expected to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging takeover proposals because, among other things, negotiation of takeover proposals might result in an improvement of their terms. Delaware Anti-Takeover Law. We are a Delaware corporation and are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the time at which the person became an interested stockholder unless: prior to that time, the board of directors approved either the business combination or transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder; or upon becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85 of the corporation s outstanding voting stock other than shares held by directors who are also officers and certain employee benefit plans; or the business combination is approved by both the board of directors and by holders of at least 66 of the corporation s outstanding voting stock at a meeting and not by written consent, excluding shares owned by the interested stockholder. For these purposes, the term business combination includes mergers, asset sales and other similar transactions with an interested stockholder. Interested stockholder means a person who, together with its affiliates and associates, owns, or under certain circumstances has owned within the prior three years, 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock. Although Section 203 permits a corporation to elect not to be governed by its provisions, we have not made this election. 

 Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and Stockholder Proposals. Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or bring other business before an annual meeting of stockholders. This procedure provides that the only persons who will be eligible for election as directors are persons who are nominated by or at the direction of the board of directors, or by a stockholder who (i) has complied with the advance notice procedures by giving timely written notice containing specified information to the Secretary prior to the meeting at which directors are to be elected or (ii) has complied with the proxy access provisions described below under Proxy Access , and the only business that may be conducted at an annual meeting is business that has been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a stockholder who has given timely written notice containing specified information to the Secretary of the stockholder s intention to bring the business before the meeting. In general, pursuant to the advance notice provisions of our by-laws, we must receive written notice of stockholder nominations to be made or business to be brought at an annual meeting not less than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the previous year s annual meeting, in order for the notice to be timely. The notice must contain information concerning the person or persons to be nominated or the matters to be brought before the meeting and concerning the stockholder submitting the proposal. The purposes of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business include the following: to afford the board of directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees or the advisability of the other proposed business; to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business; and to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Our by-laws do not give our board of directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals for action. However, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if the proper procedures are not followed. Our by-laws may also discourage or deter a third party from soliciting proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal, without regard to whether consideration of the nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders. Proxy Access. Our by-laws also permit a stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent of our outstanding common stock (excluding Class B common stock) continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in our proxy materials for our annual meeting of stockholders director nominees constituting up to the greater of two nominees or 20 of the number of directors on our board of directors which, at such time, the common stockholders are entitled to elect. 

 The foregoing proxy access right is subject to additional eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements set forth in our by-laws. In general, we must receive written notice of a nomination pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our by-laws no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date that we first mailed our proxy statement for the previous year s annual meeting of stockholders, in order for the notice to be timely. The notice must contain certain information specified in our by-laws. Director Action. Our charter and by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law generally require that a majority of a quorum is necessary to approve any matter to come before the board of directors. Certain matters, including sales of property, transactions with members of the Simon family and related persons and certain affiliates and certain other matters, will also require approval of a majority of the independent directors on the board of directors. Director Liability Limitation and Indemnification. Our charter provides that no director will be personally liable to us or to our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This will not, however, eliminate or limit the liability of a director for the following: any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us and our stockholders; acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law; any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit; or any matter in respect of which the director would be liable under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may discourage stockholders actions against directors. Directors personal liability for violating the federal securities laws is not limited or otherwise affected. In addition, these provisions do not affect the ability of stockholders to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts with respect to a transaction involving gross negligence on the part of a director. Our charter provides that we shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted under and in accordance with Delaware law any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he or she is or was our director or officer, or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer or trustee of or in any other capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. With respect to such persons, we shall indemnify against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if the following standards are met: 

 the person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that indemnification is mandatory where a director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any proceeding covered by the indemnification statute. The Delaware General Corporation Law generally permits indemnification for expenses incurred in the defense or settlement of third-party actions or action by or in right of the corporation, and for judgments in third-party actions, provided the following determination is made: the person seeking indemnification acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and in a criminal proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The determination must be made by directors who were not parties to the action, or if directed by such directors, by independent legal counsel or by a majority vote of a quorum of the stockholders. Without court approval, however, no indemnification may be made in respect of any action by or in right of the corporation in which such person is adjudged liable. Under Delaware law, the indemnification provided by statute shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. In addition, the liability of officers may not be eliminated or limited under Delaware law. The right of indemnification, including the right to receive payment in advance of expenses, conferred by our charter is not exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled. Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer Our charter contains certain restrictions on the number of shares of capital stock that individual stockholders may own. Certain requirements must be met for us to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust REIT ), including the following: not more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, to include certain entities, during the last half of a taxable year other than the first year, and our capital stock also must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. 

 In part because we currently believe it is essential for us to maintain our status as a REIT, the provisions of our charter with respect to Excess Stock contain restrictions on the acquisition of our capital stock intended to ensure compliance with these requirements. Our charter provides that, subject to certain specified exceptions, no stockholder may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code, more than the ownership limit. The ownership limit is equal to 8 , or 18 in the case of members of the Simon family and related persons, of any class of capital stock. The board of directors may exempt a person from the ownership limit if the board of directors receives a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of tax counsel that such ownership will not jeopardize our status as a REIT. Anyone acquiring shares in excess of the ownership limit will lose control over the power to dispose of the shares, will not receive dividends declared and will not be able to vote the shares. In the event of a purported transfer or other event that would, if effective, result in the ownership of shares of stock in violation of the ownership limit, the transfer or other event will be deemed void with respect to that number of shares that would be owned by the transferee in excess of the ownership limit. The intended transferee of the excess shares will acquire no rights in those shares of stock. Those shares of stock will automatically be converted into shares of Excess Stock according to rules set forth in the charter. Upon a purported transfer or other event that results in Excess Stock, the Excess Stock will be deemed to have been transferred to a trustee to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of a qualifying charitable organization designated by us. The Excess Stock will be issued and outstanding stock, and it will be entitled to dividends equal to any dividends which are declared and paid on the stock from which it was converted. Any dividend or distribution paid prior to our discovery that stock has been converted into Excess Stock is to be repaid upon demand. The recipient of the dividend will be personally liable to the trust. Any dividend or distribution declared but unpaid will be rescinded as void with respect to the shares of stock and will automatically be deemed to have been declared and paid with respect to the shares of Excess Stock into which the shares were converted. The Excess Stock will also be entitled to the voting rights as are ascribed to the stock from which it was converted. Any voting rights exercised prior to our discovery that shares of stock were converted to Excess Stock will be rescinded and recast as determined by the trustee. While Excess Stock is held in trust, an interest in that trust may be transferred by the purported transferee, or other purported holder with respect to the Excess Stock, only to a person whose ownership of the shares of stock would not violate the ownership limit. Upon such transfer, the Excess Stock will be automatically exchanged for the same number of shares of stock of the same type and class as the shares of stock for which the Excess Stock was originally exchanged. Our charter contains provisions that are designed to ensure that the purported transferee or other purported holder of the Excess Stock may not receive in return for such a transfer an amount that reflects any appreciation in the shares of stock for which the Excess Stock was exchanged during the period that the Excess Stock was outstanding. Any amount received by a purported transferee or other purported holder in excess of the amount permitted to be received must be paid over to the trust. If the foregoing restrictions are determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision, statute, rule or regulation, then the intended transferee or holder of any Excess Stock may be deemed, at our option, to have acted as an agent on behalf of the trust in acquiring or holding the Excess Stock and to hold the Excess Stock on behalf of the trust. 

 Our charter further provides that we may purchase, for a period of 90 days during the time the Excess Stock is held by the trustee in trust, all or any portion of the Excess Stock from the original transferee-stockholder at the lesser of the following: the price paid for the stock by the purported transferee, or if no notice of such purchase price is given, at a price to be determined by the board of directors, in its sole discretion, but no lower than the lowest market price of such stock at any time prior to the date we exercise our purchase option, and the closing market price for the stock on the date we exercise our option to purchase. The 90-day period begins on the date of the violative transfer or other event if the original transferee-stockholder gives notice to us of the transfer or, if no notice is given, the date the board of directors determines that a violative transfer or other event has occurred. Our charter further provides that in the event of a purported issuance or transfer that would, if effective, result in us being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, such issuance or transfer would be deemed null and void, and the intended transferee would acquire no rights to the stock. All certificates representing shares of any class of our stock bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above. All persons who own, directly or by virtue of the attribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code, more than 5 , or such other percentage as may be required by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations promulgated thereunder, of the outstanding stock must file an affidavit with us containing the information specified in the charter before January 30 of each year. In addition, each stockholder shall, upon demand, be required to disclose to us in writing such information with respect to the direct, indirect and constructive ownership of shares as the board of directors deems necessary to comply with the provisions of the charter or the Internal Revenue Code applicable to a REIT. The Excess Stock provision will not be removed automatically even if the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are changed so as to no longer contain any ownership concentration limitation or if the ownership concentration limitation is increased. In addition to preserving our status as a REIT, the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors. Listing Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SPG. Preferred Stock Rank The Series J Preferred Stock, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Simon, rank (i) junior to all other shares of capital stock of Simon which, by their terms, rank senior to the Series J Preferred Stock, (ii) on a parity with all other shares of Simon preferred stock which are not, by their terms, junior or senior to the Series J Preferred Stock and (iii) senior to the common stock and Class B common stock and to all other shares of capital 

 stock of Simon which, by their terms, rank junior to the Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with any other class or series of Simon s capital stock that is not by its terms junior to the Series J Preferred Stock. Dividends Holders of the Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by the Simon board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375 of the liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to 4.1875 per share per annum). Such dividends shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December or, if not a business day, the succeeding business day. Any dividend payable on the Series J Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends are payable to holders of record as they appear in the stock records of Simon at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th day of the calendar month in which the applicable dividend payment date falls or such other date designated by the Simon board of directors for the payment of dividends that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date. No dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Simon board of directors or be paid or set apart for payment by Simon at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of Simon, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if such authorization or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not Simon has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such dividends are authorized. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock shall not bear interest and holders of the Series J Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends as described above. No dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any capital stock of Simon ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series J Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment therefor set apart for such payment on the Series J Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series J Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series J Preferred Stock, all dividends declared on the Series J Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series J Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series J Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share of Series J Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock bear to each other. Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment therefor set apart for such payment on the Series J Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no dividends (other than in shares of 

 common stock or other capital stock ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other distribution be declared or made upon the common stock, Class B common stock or any other capital stock of Simon ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any shares of common stock, Class B common stock or any other capital stock of Simon ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such shares) by Simon (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of Simon ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation). Any dividend payment made on the Series J Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable. Liquidation Preference In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Simon (generally referred to herein as a liquidation ), the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of Simon legally available for distribution to its stockholders liquidating distributions in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by Simon s board of directors in the amount of a liquidation preference of 50.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon to the date of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock, Class B common stock or any other capital stock ranking junior to the Series J Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series J Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of Simon. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Simon, the legally available assets of Simon are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on the Series J Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on the shares of any other series of preferred stock of Simon ranking on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets upon liquidation, then the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock of Simon ranking on a parity with the Series J Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets upon liquidation shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. The consolidation or merger of Simon with or into any other entity or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of Simon shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Simon. Conversion The Series J Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of Simon. Optional Redemption The Series J Preferred Stock are not redeemable prior to October 15, 2027. On and after October 15, 2027, Simon, at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written notice, may redeem 

 the Series J Preferred Stock, in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, in cash at a redemption price of 50.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (except as provided below), without interest, to the extent Simon will have funds legally available therefor. The redemption price of the Series J Preferred Stock (other than any portion thereof consisting of accumulated and unpaid dividends) shall be paid solely from the sale proceeds of other capital stock of Simon and not from any other source. For purposes of the preceding sentence, capital stock means any common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, interests, participation, or other ownership interests (however designated) and any rights (other than debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities) or options to purchase any of the foregoing. Holders of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such Series J Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price upon such surrender. If notice of redemption of any Series J Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been irrevocably set aside by Simon in trust for the benefit of the holders of any Series J Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date dividends will cease to accumulate on such Series J Preferred Stock, such stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such Series J Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If fewer than all of the outstanding Series J Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional Series J Preferred Stock) or by any other equitable method determined by Simon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment therefor set apart for such payment on the Series J Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no Series J Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding Series J Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series J Preferred Stock to preserve the REIT status of Simon or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding Series J Preferred Stock. In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment therefor set apart for such payment on the Series J Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, Simon shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any Series J Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of Series J Preferred Stock to preserve the REIT status of Simon or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding Series J Preferred Stock. Notice of redemption will be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. A similar notice furnished by Simon will be mailed by the registrar, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the share transfer records of the registrar. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series J Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the Series J Preferred Stock is to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends 

 on the Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all the shares of Series J Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder. The holders of Series J Preferred Stock at the close of business on a dividend record date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to the Series J Preferred Stock on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the redemption thereof between such dividend record date and the corresponding dividend payment date or Simon s default in the payment of the dividend due. Except as provided above, Simon will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed. The Series J Preferred Stock does not have a stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions. Voting Rights Except as indicated below or except as otherwise from time to time required by applicable law, the holders of Series J Preferred Stock have no voting rights. On any matter on which the Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as expressly provided herein or as may be required by law), including any action by written consent, each share of Series J Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote. With respect to each share of Series J Preferred Stock, the holder thereof may designate a proxy, with each such proxy having the right to vote on behalf of such holder. If dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not such quarterly periods are consecutive, holders of the Series J Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of Simon preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Simon board of directors at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at least ten percent of the Series J Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of the stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series J Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside for payment. In such case, the entire Simon board of directors will be increased by two directors. So long as any Series J Preferred Stock remains outstanding, Simon will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 of the Series J Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class), (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series J Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Simon or reclassify any authorized capital stock of Simon into such capital stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such capital stock; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the charter (including the Certificate of Designations of the Series J Preferred Stock), whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series J Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (ii) above, so long as the 

 Series J Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of an event set forth in clause (ii) above Simon may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of holders of Series J Preferred Stock; and provided, further, that (x) any increase in the amount of the authorized Simon preferred stock or the creation or the issuance of any other series of Simon preferred stock or (y) any increase in the amount of authorized Series J Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series J Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series J Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption. Restrictions on Transfer Holders of Series J Preferred Stock are subject to certain restrictions on the number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock that such holder may own in order to preserve Simon s status as a REIT. See Description of Common Stock Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer above. Each holder of Series J Preferred Stock shall upon demand be required to disclose to Simon in writing such information as Simon may request in good faith in order to determine Simon s status as a REIT. Listing Our Series J Preferred Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SPGJ.
