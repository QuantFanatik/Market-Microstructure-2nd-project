 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. we , us , our , Ridgefield or the Company was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc. On June 23, 2006, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that effected the merger between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Nevada RAC-NV ), pursuant to the Articles of Merger, whereby RAC-NV was the surviving corporation. The merger changed the domicile of the Company from the State of Colorado to the State of Nevada. Furthermore, as a result of the Articles of Merger the Company is authorized to issue 35,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, .001 par value per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, .01 par value per share. On March 9, 1999, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to JOT Automation, Inc. (the JOT Transaction ). As a result of the JOT Transaction, the Company s historical business, with operations primarily involving a depaneling and routing businesses, was considered to be a discontinued operation and, consequently, provides no benefit to persons seeking to understand the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Following the JOT Transaction, the Company devoted its efforts to the development of a prototype micro-robotic device (the micro-robotic device to manipulate organic tissues on an extremely small scale. Due to the inability to complete the micro-robotic device, the Company determined that it would cease the development of the micro-robotic device and, as of June 30, 2000, the capitalized costs related to the patent underlying the micro-robotic device were written off by the Company. On March 19, 2002, the Company was awarded United States Patent No. US 6,358,749 B1 for the Automated System for Chromosome Microdissection and Method of Using Same (the Patent ). During the first quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the purposes of owning, developing and exploiting the Patent. On March 3, 2003, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to form Bio-Medical Automation, Inc., a Nevada corporation wholly-owned by the Company Bio-Medical or the Subsidiary ). In May 2003, the Company transferred the Patent to the Subsidiary in exchange for 100 of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Subsidiary. The Company never derived any revenues from the Patent. As of December 31, 2022, Bio-Medical had 35,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized for issuance consisting of (1) 30,000,000 shares of common stock par value .001 per share; and (2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock par value .01 per share. Bio-Medical has 1,140,773 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, all of which are owned by the Company. Bio-Medical has no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. A copy of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of Bio-Medical are attached to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2005 as Exhibit 3.6 and Exhibit 3.7, respectively, and such documents are incorporated herein by reference. Since July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters relating to the timely filing of periodic reports as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Act. Accordingly, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 we earned no revenues. Our principal executive office is located at 3827 S Carson St, Unit 505-25 PMB 1078, Carson City, NV 89701, and the telephone number is (805) 484-8855. Our website address is www.ridgefieldacquisition.com. None of the information on our website is part of this Form 10-K. Acquisition Strategy Our plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, our objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company s shareholders. While we have identified various operating entities, none have risen to the level of being a viable entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.

 The selection of a business opportunity is a complex process and involves a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to economic conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and other factors. In many cases, management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state law to do so. The Company may need additional funds in order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. Competition In connection with its Acquisition Strategy, the Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having business objectives similar to those of the Company. Many of these entities, including SPACs, venture capital firms, blind pool companies, large industrial and financial institutions, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, are well-established and have extensive experience in connection with identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to compete successfully with such entities. The Company s financial resources will be limited in comparison to those of many of its competitors. The Company s limited financial resources may compel the Company to select certain less attractive acquisition prospects. Employees As of February 28, 2023, the Company had 1 employee, Steven N. Bronson, who serves as the Company s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer but takes no salary. The Company does not have any employees that are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Not required. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Company maintains an administrative office at 3827 S Carson St, Unit 505-25 PMB 1078, Carson City, NV 89701, which serves as its principal office. Steven N. Bronson, the Company s Chairman, President, CEO, and majority shareholder, primarily works remotely from his private office in California, at his own expense.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are not party to any legal proceedings. We may, from time to time, be party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As our acquisition strategy develops, we may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of any future matters could materially affect our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not applicable.

The Company has not issued any preferred stock. Penny Stock Regulations The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.

 These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities. Dividend Policy We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the execution of our acquisition strategy and the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, if at all. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Purchases of Equity Securities By The Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities None. Purchase of Our Equity by Officers and Directors On March 26, 2021, the Company sold 1,600,000 shares of its Common Stock to its President and Chief Executive Officer, Steven N. Bronson at a price of 0.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 400,000. Mr. Bronson paid the purchase price for the shares by cancelling 349,442 in principal and accrued interest outstanding under a Revolving Promissory Note, dated as of December 31, 2016, made by the Company in favor of Mr. Bronson, as amended to date, and paying 50,558 in cash. Other Information The Company s shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 promulgated thereunder, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. we , us , our , Ridgefield or the Company was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc.

 In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, our objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company s shareholders. As stated before, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, and there can be no assurance that such a transaction will result in long-term capital appreciation. In connection with its Acquisition Strategy, the Company expects to encounter competition from other entities having business objectives similar to those of the Company. Many of these entities, including SPACs, venture capital firms, blind pool companies, large industrial and financial institutions, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, are well-established and have extensive experience in connection with identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to compete successfully with such entities. The Company s financial resources will be limited in comparison to those of many of its competitors. The Company s limited financial resources may compel the Company to select certain less attractive acquisition prospects. Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 Revenues During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company earned no revenues from operations. Overall, the Company incurred a net loss of 63,899 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 58,533 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Because the Company s operations are primarily administrative, the increase in net loss relates entirely to an increase in general and administrative (G A) expenses, offset slightly by a reduction in interest expense. General and Administrative Expenses G A expenses consist of professional fees, service charges, office expenses and similar items. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred G A expenses of 58,923 compared to G A expenses of 50,148 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of 8,775 is almost entirely attributable to an increase in legal and other professional fees incurred as part of due diligence for a potential transaction that was abandoned. Going forward we expect to see annual increases in costs related to compliance and expenses of being a public company, as well as fees related to due diligence when potential transactions are presented. Other Expenses Other expenses primarily represent state licenses, filing fees, minimum tax expense and net interest expense. Other expenses decreased to 4,976 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 8,385 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease relates primarily to interest expense. The Company incurred net interest expense of 2,411 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 5,681 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, largely as a result of the cancellation of a loan from the President of the Company. The loan was cancelled on March 26, 2021 and the Company has since carried a lower debt burden. The decrease in interest expense is consistent with the decrease in underlying principal, and is expected to continue that track going forward. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures have been funded from cash balances on hand, loans and the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 21,200 and working capital of 20,390, excluding the related party debt. With the related party debt, we had a working capital deficit of 62,021). Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds. We did not have any short-term or long-term investments as of December 31, 2022.

 Historically, the Company satisfied its working capital needs from related party loans from Steven N. Bronson, the Chairman, President, CEO, and majority shareholder. On December 31, 2016, Mr. Bronson entered into a revolving loan agreement (the 2016 Bronson Note whereby Mr. Bronson would loan the Company money from time-to-time to fund working capital needs to pay operating expenses. The 2016 Bronson Note was unsecured, was repayable upon demand and accrued interest at the rate of 10 per annum. On March 26, 2021, the Company sold 1,600,000 shares of its Common Stock to Mr. Bronson at a price of 0.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 400,000.

 Critical Estimates and Judgments The preparation of the Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to receivables and accrued expenses. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable based on the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company s financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of the Company s deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. These accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Going Concern The Company has an accumulated deficit balance as of December 31, 2022 and net loss during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of this filing, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. The Company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout 2023. In order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing and/or sales of equity and debt securities. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. Economy and Inflation Many leading economists predict high rates of inflation will continue into 2023 and potentially beyond. While we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our Company s results of operations, inflation generally interferes with the provision of investment capital. A prolonged period of high inflation may impact our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy. On the other hand, when business conditions worsen and the stock market corrects, it may be easier for us to identify an acquisition candidate. The new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 2019 COVID has since spread globally, with more contagious variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, also emerging. While vaccines have proven effective at reducing the risk of serious health consequences from COVID, some governments have continued to implement various measures, or impose restrictions, in an effort to lessen the spread of the virus. We cannot make any predictions concerning the continuing severity, magnitude and duration of the pandemic, including impacts of virus variants and resurgences, and of government, business and individual responses. Although we do not expect COVID to impact our operations, it could impact our acquisition strategy, positively or negatively.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. and its subsidiary (collectively, the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern Matter The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018. February 28, 2023

 At December 31, 2022, the Company has a federal net operating loss carry-forward of available to offset future federal taxable income. The Company s remaining federal net operating loss carry-forward will expire between , with the exception of which may be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code. At December 31, 2022, the Company has a state net operating loss carry-forward in California of available to offset future state taxable income in that state. The Company s remaining California net operating loss carry-forward will expire between , with the exception of which may be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. At December 31, 2022, the Company also has a state net operating loss carry-forward in Florida of available to offset future state taxable income in that state. The Company s remaining Florida net operating loss carry-forward will expire between . Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the Florida Income Tax Code. Because the Company no longer has taxable nexus in Florida, we do not expect to have taxable income there in the future. As a result, the Company permanently wrote-off the related deferred tax assets. However, since the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets, this write-off had no impact on tax expense. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, cumulative losses, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 was , an increase of from December 31, 2021 when the balance was . The valuation allowance increased due to additional tax losses in 2022, offset by the tax effect of expiring NOLs of . Under GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. U.S. federal income tax returns after 2018 remain open to examination. Generally, state income tax returns after 2017 remain open to examination. No income tax returns are currently under examination. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, and continues to monitor its current and prior tax positions for any changes. The Company recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were penalties or interest recorded in income tax expense. per month that was intended to cover administrative costs. Steven N.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Evaluation of disclosure and controls and procedures Based on his evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company s principal executive officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to two identified material weaknesses: a) we lack an audit committee and b) we have limited or no segregation of duties. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Internal control over financial reporting is defined, under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 The Company s principal executive officer has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s principal executive officer was guided by the releases issued by the SEC and to the extent applicable the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s principal executive officer has concluded that based on his assessment, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s procedures of internal control over financial reporting were not effective due to two identified material weaknesses: a) we lack an audit committee and b) we have limited or no segregation of duties. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until such time as the organization can increase sufficiently in size to warrant an increase in personnel required to effectively execute and monitor formal internal control procedures, those formal procedures will not be implemented. Readers are cautioned that internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm, as the Company is a smaller reporting company that is only required to provide management s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings To the best of our knowledge, during the past five years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present director, person nominated to become director, executive officer, or control person: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. Audit Committee In view of the Company s lack of operations, the Board of Directors did not form an Audit Committee. Instead, the full Board of Directors assumes the responsibilities of an Audit Committee. The full Board consists of Steven N. Bronson and Leonard A. Hagan. The Audit Committee related functions of the Board are the appointment of independent auditors for the Company and to analyze the reports and recommendations of such auditors. The Board also monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company s financial controls and reporting procedures. The Board does not meet on a regular basis, but only as circumstances require. Due the size of the Company and its lack of current operations, the Board has not designated a financial expert. Code of Ethics At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on March 25, 2004, the Company adopted a Code of Ethics.

Officers, directors and greater than 10 shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To the Company s knowledge, based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, during the year ended December 31, 2022, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were complied with.
