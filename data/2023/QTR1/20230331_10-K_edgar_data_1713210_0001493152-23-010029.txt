Our
Business Model 

We
believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products, because sales of health solution and personal care
products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact between retail consumers and distributors. This personal contact may enhance consumers 
nutritional and health education and motivate consumers to begin and maintain wellness and weight management programs. In addition, by
using our products themselves, distributors can provide first-hand testimonials of product effectiveness, which can serve as a powerful
sales tool. 

We
are focused on building and maintaining our distributor network by offering financially rewarding and flexible career opportunities through
the sale of quality, innovative products to health-conscious consumers. We believe the income opportunity provided by our bonus program
appeals to a broad cross-section of our members, particularly those seeking to supplement family income, start a home business or pursue
entrepreneurial, full and part-time, employment opportunities. Our distributors, who are all independent third parties, profit from selling
our products and also earning bonuses through performance of their network group, the establishment of their own network group and the
performance of distributors recruited under their own network group. Top performing distributors with their own physical stores may also
become stockists of the company, whereby they enjoy benefits such as maintaining a certain amount of the Company s inventory in
their store premises, with the requirement that all product sales are monitored through our centralized stock tracking system and accounted
back to us. The stockists have the option of returning or exchanging any unsold inventory consigned to them. 

We
enable distributors to maximize their potential by providing a broad array of motivational, educational and support services. We motivate
our distributors through our performance-based compensation plan, product-training seminars, workshops and participation in routine promotional
activities. 

We
are committed to providing professionally designed educational training materials that our distributors can use to enhance recruitment
and to maximize their sales. We conduct several training sessions per year to motivate our distributors. These training events teach
our distributors not only how to develop invaluable business-building and leadership skills, but also how to differentiate our products
with their consumers, including information sessions presented by in-house nutritional consultants. 

Our
corporate-sponsored training events provide a forum for distributors, who otherwise operate independently, to share ideas with us and
each other. In addition, we are also developing an e-marketing and e-trading platform allowing for marketing and trading of products
to members, as well as online recruitment of new members and to provide direct sales to customers. 

We
are committed to providing our distributors with quality products to help them increase sales and recruit additional distributors. We
leverage our team of in-house nutritional consultants with rich experience gained in the area of nutrition, in collaborating with our
customers and clients to understand the health and wellness market via a process of consultative review. This review team is headed by
the Head of Product Development. We then communicate our findings and proposals to third-party suppliers to improve formulations, to
bring about new products for distributors and members who are ready to market to end-users. 

We
place a strong emphasis on the science of nutrition. We have obtained the appropriate authorizations from the Food Safety and Quality
Division, and the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia for all our products. Whenever products
are purchased for inventory replenishment, samples are randomly selected from every batch for testing at laboratories registered with
the Ministry of Health Malaysia. 

19 

Our
Customers 

General 

We
provide health and wellness products and advisory services to health-conscious customers in the Malaysian market. Such customers are
able to enjoy membership discounts across all our products by becoming a member. 

Our
distributors enjoy further discounts on all of our products. Besides our three sales branches located in Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and
Ipoh, our products are all distributed to customers and members by our distributor s networks, which are comprised of three stockists
who are also independent distributors, whose store premises are located in two other locations in Malaysia. 

We
believe that our products are particularly well-suited for direct distribution because the sale of health and nutrition products are
strengthened by ongoing personal contact between retail customers and distributors. We believe our continued commitment to source quality
science-based products will enhance our ability to attract new customer, as well as increase the productivity and retention of our distributors. 

Structure
of the membership program 

Our
customers are able to become lifetime members by paying a one-time membership fee with the purchase of specific products. Doing so allows
the customer to enjoy membership discounts on all our products. 

Members
who accumulate a predetermined number of purchases are automatically promoted to become a distributor of the Company. Other than helping
distributors achieve physical health and wellness through the use of our products, we offer our distributors, who are independent third
parties, bonuses based on various performance factors. Distributors are required to maintain a predetermined number of purchases per
year in order to maintain their distributor status. 

Top
performing distributors with their own physical stores may also become stockists of the Company, whereby they enjoy benefits such as
maintaining a certain amount of the Company s inventory in their store premises. The stockists shall account to the Company for
all products sales from their store premises as monitored through the Company s centralized stock tracking system. The stockists
shall have the option to either return or exchange the Company s inventory consigned to them that are unsold. 

The
following table sets forth the number of members and distributors at the date indicated:

 As at December 31, 2022

 128,619 

Distributors 
and members earnings 

Distributors
and members earn profits from the sales of our products to customers. Distributors enjoy additional discounts compared to members, allowing
them to earn higher direct profits through the differences in pricing when selling products they bought at distributors prices
which are more favorable than member s prices to customers. 

Members
are encouraged to build their respective network group. Members are promoted to distributors if they manage to recruit the requisite
number of members; and the network group is able to achieve set sales targets. Other than preferential distributor pricing for the purchase
of the Company s products, distributors enjoy bonuses from the collective performance of their network group. There are several
levels of distributors depending on the size and the collective sales performance of their respective network group. Each level affords
bonus benefits in a different form in ascending order. A higher-level distributor will be compensated with higher returns in the form
of bonus entitlements. 

20 

Distributors
and members motivation and training 

We
believe that motivation, inspiration and training are key elements in the success of sales via network group marketing. Together with
our distributors and members, we have established a consistent schedule of gatherings to support those needs. We conduct several training
sessions per year to educate and motivate our distributors and members. The training sessions are typically presented by in-house staff
with suitable background in nutrition, in order to provide key nutrition information about our products, as well as providing workshops
to promote presentation skills to attending participants. 

Our
Suppliers 

Currently,
all of our products are acquired from unrelated third parties located in Australia, the United States, Germany and Malaysia, and rebranded
by us. Due to the high costs associated with research and development of nutrition and health products, we do not maintain any facilities
to produce our products. We have no expenditures or expenses relating to research and development of our product. We leverage our team
of in-house nutritional consultants with rich experience gained in the area of nutritionist work, in collaborating with our customers
and clients to understand the health and wellness market via a process of consultative review. We then communicate our findings and proposals
to third-party suppliers to improve formulations and to bring about new products for distributors and members who are ready to market
to end-users.

from the Food Safety and Quality Division of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia according to the Food Act 1983 (ACT 281) Regulations

system

trading platform. Our e-trading initiative will be actively promoted for online recruitment of new members by existing distributors and
to provide direct sales to customers. Once the E-trading platform has provided tangible results in the Malaysia market, we intend to

Insurance 

The
Employees Social Security Act, 1969, Malaysia mandates employers and employees to make a monthly contribution to the Social Security
Organisation, Malaysia, SOCSO for any employee who is employed for wages paid under a contract of service or apprenticeship
with an employer for the purpose of providing social security protection to employees and their dependents against occupational injuries,
including industrial accident, accident during emergency at the employers premises, occupational diseases and commuting accidents.
Depending on the monthly wages earned by the employee, employers shall cause to be deducted from the respective employee s wages,
amounts that ranges between RM0.10 to RM19.75 for monthly wages between RM30 to RM4,000. The employers contribution corresponds
to the said rates are between RM0.4 to RM69.05. Rates applicable to both the employee and employer are fixed at the maximum rate of RM19.75
and RM69.05 respectively. Employees who have attained 60 years of age are not required to contribute to the scheme. The employer s
responsibility towards this group shall be at a reduced rate which ranges between MYR0.30 to RM49.40 for the said wage band. 

Other
than SOCSO, effective January 1, 2018, employees and employers in the private sector are mandated to contribute to an employment insurance
system, EIS under the Employment Insurance System Act, 2017. Both the employee and employer shall contribute at an equal
rate at 0.2 of the employee s wages under the scheme, subject to a maximum monthly wage rate of RM4,000. No further contribution
to the scheme is required from the employee or the employer for employees who have attained 60 years of age; and employees aged 57 and
above who have no prior contributions are exempted. 

We
do not have any third-party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising
from accidents on our property or relating to our operations. Such insurance is not mandatory according to the laws and regulations of
Malaysia. We typically do not require our distributors to purchase insurance regarding their operations. We believe this practice is
consistent with customary industry standards.

At
present, our products are predominately sold in Malaysia. As the contents and combination of the main ingredients in our ATP Zeta Health
Program and BEAUNIQUE series are categorized as health food rather than medicines or drugs, all of our products require authorization

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

We
are exposed to concentration risk of heavy reliance on our three largest suppliers for the supply of our products, and any shortage of,
or delay in, the supply may significantly impact on our business and results of operation. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 198,376, 82,434 and 79,365 from three of our major suppliers, represented approximately
53 , 22 and 21 , respectively, of our total purchases. Our business, financial condition and operating results depend on the continuous
supply of products from our major suppliers and our continuous supplier-customer relationships with them. Our heavy reliance on our major
suppliers for the supply of our products will have significant impact on our business and results of operation in the event of any shortage
of, or delay in the supply. 

We
currently do not have long term supply agreements with our three largest suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2022, and we typically
make ad hoc purchases through submission of purchase order forms. There is no assurance that our major suppliers will continue to supply
their products in the quantities and timeframes required by us to meet the needs of our customers or comply with their supply agreements
with us. Our product supply may also be disrupted by potential labor disputes, strike action, natural disasters or other accidents, epidemic
and pandemic affecting the supplier. If our major suppliers do not supply products to us in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities,
our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 

Furthermore,
in the event of any delay in delivery of the products to us, our cash flow or working capital may be materially and adversely affected
as a result of the corresponding delay in delivery of our products to our customers, and hence the delay in our receipt of payment from
our customers. 

Our
major suppliers may change their existing sales or marketing strategy in respect of the products supplied to us by changing their export
strategy, reducing its sales or production volume or changing its selling prices. Consequently, there are no assurances that our major
suppliers will not appoint other dealers or distributors which may compete with us in the market where we operate. Furthermore, any significant
increase in the selling prices of the products which we source from our suppliers will increase our costs and may adversely affect our
profit margin if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to our customers. 

There
are no assurances that there will be no deterioration in our relationships with our major suppliers which could affect our ability to
secure sufficient supply of products for our business. In the event that our major suppliers change their sales or marketing strategy
or otherwise appoint other dealers or distributors who may compete with us, our business, financial condition and operating results may
be materially and adversely affected. 

We
could be adversely affected by a change in consumer preferences, perception and spending habits and failure to develop or enrich our
product offering or gain market acceptance of our new products could have a negative effect on our business. 

The
market we operate is subject to changes in consumer preference, perception and spending habits. Our performance depends significantly
on factors which may affect the level and pattern of consumer spending in the market we operate. Such factors include consumer preference,
consumer confidence, consumer income and consumer perception of the safety and quality of our products. Media coverage regarding the
safety or quality of, or diet or health issues relating to, our products or the raw materials, ingredients or processes involved in their
manufacturing, may damage consumer confidence in our products. A general decline in the consumption of our products could occur as a
result of change in consumer preference, perception and spending habits at any time. 

Any
failure to adapt our product offering to respond to such changes may result in a decrease in our sales if such changes are related to
certain of our products. Any changes in consumer preference could result in lower sales of our products, put pressure on pricing or lead
to increased levels of selling and promotional expenses. In any event a decrease in customer demand on our products may also result in
lower sales and slow down the consumption of our inventory to a low inventory turnover level. Any of these changes could result in a
material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. 

27 

The
success of our products depends on a number of factors including our ability to accurately anticipate changes in market demand and consumer
preferences, our ability to differentiate the quality of our products from those of our competitors, and the effectiveness of our marketing
and advertising campaigns for our products. We may not be successful in identifying trends in consumer preferences and developing products
that respond to such trends in a timely manner. We also may not be able to effectively promote our products by our marketing and advertising
campaigns and gain market acceptance. If our products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements, or have
quality problems, we may not be able to fully recover our costs and expenses incurred in our operation, and our business prospects, financial
condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

If
we fail to maintain quality products and value, our sales are likely to be negatively affected. 

Our
success depends on the safety and quality of products that we obtain from our suppliers for our customers. Our future customers will
identify our brand name with a certain level of quality and value. If we cannot meet this perceived value or level of quality, we may
be negatively affected and our operating results may suffer. In addition, any failure on the part of our suppliers to maintain the quality
of their products, will in turn substantially harm the results of our business operations, potentially forcing us to identify other suppliers
or alter our business strategy significantly. 

If
we are unable to create brand influence, we may not be able to maintain current or attract new users and customers for our products. 

Our
operational and financial performance is highly dependent on the strength of our brand. We believe brand familiarity and preference will
continue to have a significant role in winning customers as the decision to buy our products and services. In order to further expand
our customer base, we may need to substantially increase our marketing expenditures to enhance brand awareness through various online
and offline means. Moreover, negative coverage in the media of our company could threaten the perception of our brand, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to defuse negative press coverage about our company to the satisfaction of our investors, customers and
suppliers. If we are unable to defuse negative press coverage about our company, our brand may suffer in the marketplace, our operational
and financial performance may be negatively impacted and the price of our shares may decline. 

Currently,
we sell our products, with or without customization, under our brand name ATP , to domestic customers in Malaysia and to
overseas customers. However, if our competitors initiate a lawsuit against us for infringing their trademark, we may be forced to adopt
a new brand name for our products. As a result, we may incur additional marketing cost to raise awareness of such new brand name. We
may also be ordered to pay a significant amount of damages, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected. 

We
may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. 

We
rely on intellectual property laws in Malaysia and other jurisdictions to protect our trademarks. We are the registered owner of two
trademarks. We have recently applied to register an additional three trademarks in Malaysia. We cannot assure you that counterfeiting
or imitation of our products will not occur in the future or, if it does occur, that we will be able to address the problem in a timely
and effective manner. Any occurrence of counterfeiting or imitation of our products or other infringement of our intellectual property
rights could negatively affect our brand and our reputation, which in turn adversely affects the results of our operations. 

Litigation
to prosecute infringement of our intellectual property rights could be costly and lengthy and will divert our managerial and financial
resources. We will have to bear costs of the intellectual property litigation and may be unable to recover such costs from our opposite
parties. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of or products until such
litigation is resolved. The occurrence of any of the foregoing will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

We
may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or product recalls or adverse publicity relating to our products. 

We
may incur losses resulting from product liability claims with respect to our products supplied by our supplier. We may face claims or
liabilities which may arise if there exist any defects in quality of these products or any of these products are deemed or proven to
be unsafe, defective or contaminated. In the event that the use or misuse of any product distributed by us results in personal injury
or death, product liability and/or indemnity claims may be brought against us, in addition to our product recalls, and the relevant regulatory
authorities in the market we operate may close down some of our related operations and take administrative actions against us. If we
experience any business disruption and litigation, we may incur additional costs and have to divert our management s attention
and resources on such matters, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

28 

We
operate in a heavily regulated industry. 

Our
business is principally regulated by various laws and regulations in the market we operate, such as in Malaysia the Food Act of 1983
(Act 281) and Regulations, Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulations 1984 mandate authorization from the Food Safety and Quality Division
and National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency of the Ministry of Health for our Company s products to be sold in the country. Various
registrations, certificates and/or licenses for the conduct of our business are required under the above laws, which also contain provisions
for requirements on the storage, labelling, advertising and importation of some of our products. 

Based
on our experience, some of the laws and regulations of the place where we operate our business are subject to amendments, uncertainty
in interpretation and administrative actions from time to time. Therefore, we cannot assure you that, for the implementation of our business
plans and the introduction of any new product, we will be able to obtain all the necessary registrations, certificates and/or licenses.
Any failure to comply with the above laws and regulations may give rise to fines, administrative penalties and/or prosecution against
us, which may adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or results of operation. 

We
had previously relied on our variable interest entity, Agape S.E.A. Sdn Bhd, in Malaysia for our business operations, which may not be
as effective in providing operational control or enabling us to derive economic benefits as through ownership of controlling equity interests.
While we no longer rely on Agape S.E.A. Sdn Bhd for our operations, we may do so in the future. 

Agape
S.E.A. Sdn Bhd s equity at risk was insufficient to finance its business activities and it provided all of the Company s
purchases during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As a result, it is considered to be a variable interest entity VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary since it has both of the following characteristics, (a) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to
absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
potentially be significant to the VIE. However, the Company no longer relied on the VIE after the fiscal year ended December 31,
2020. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Agape S.E.A. Sdn Bhd did not provide any purchase to the Company. In addition, Agape S.E.A. s impact to our consolidated
financial statements constitutes less than 1 of our total consolidated assets. While the Company have not made any purchases from the VIE for the year ended December 31, 2022, we may expect to continue to
rely on ASL s beneficiary ownership structure with Agape S.E.A. to operate our business. If we fail to continue our
beneficiary ownership structure with Agape S.E.A. in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated
to the public. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive
and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and/or
directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

29 

In
connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, we identified three material
weaknesses , and other control deficiencies including significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial
reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified related to the Company
were: (i) insufficient full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily
recording of transactions, address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related
disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii) lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the
preventive internal control procedures and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that the
Company s policies and procedures have been carried out as planned; (iii) lack of proper IT policies and procedures developed
for system change management, user access management, backup management and service organization management. 

We
have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remedy these material weaknesses. The measures that we are planning to
take include, but not limited to, hiring of suitable IT personnel to develop and implement proper IT policies and procedures for
system change management, user access management, backup management and service organization management, form an internal audit
function and have plans to hire internal auditors to strengthen our overall governance. All internal auditors will be independent of
our operations and will report directly to the audit committee. The implementation of these measures may not fully address the
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot conclude that they have been fully remedied. Our
failure to correct theses material weaknesses or our failure to discover and address any other material weaknesses could result in
inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting
requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. 

As
a public company, we will become subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX 404, will require
that we include a report from management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on
Form 10-K and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q if we are qualified as an accelerated filer. Our management may conclude that our
internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over
financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may
issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented,
designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, after we become a public
company, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems
for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation. 

30 

During
the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of SOX 404, we may identify
other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy
of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may
not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with SOX 404.
If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial
statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading
price of our shares. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or
misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations
and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. 

Legal
disputes or proceedings could expose us to liability, divert our management s attention and negatively impact our reputation. 

We
may at times be involved in potential legal disputes or proceedings during the ordinary course of business operations relating to product
or other types of liability, employees claims, labor disputes or contract disputes that could have a material and adverse effect
on our reputation, operation and financial condition. If we become involved in material or protracted legal proceedings or other legal
disputes in the future, the outcome of such proceedings could be uncertain and could result in settlements or outcomes which adversely
affect our financial condition. In addition, any litigation or legal proceedings could incur substantial legal expenses as well as significant
time and attention of our management, diverting their attention from our business and operations. 

Our
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, or effectively manage our employees, customers and business partners, could
severely damage our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We
are subject to risks in relation to actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers that constitute
violations of the anti-corruption laws and regulations. While we adopt strict internal procedures and work closely with relevant government
agencies to ensure compliance of our business operations with relevant laws and regulations, our efforts may not be sufficient to ensure
that we comply with relevant laws and regulations at all times. If we, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers
violate these laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to fines and/or other penalties. Actions by Malaysia regulatory authorities
or the courts to provide an alternative interpretation of the laws and regulations or to adopt additional anti-bribery or anti-corruption
related regulations could also require us to make changes to our operations. Our reputation, corporate image, and business operations
may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with these measures or become the target of any negative publicity as a
result of actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers. 

If
we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new products or services or enhance existing products or services, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

We
must continually source, develop and introduce new products and services as well as improve and enhance our existing products and services
to maintain or increase our sales. The success of new or enhanced products or services may depend on a number of factors including, anticipating
and effectively addressing user preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, effective forecasting and management
of products and services demands, purchase commitments, and the quality of or defects in our products. The risk of not meeting our customers 
preferences and demands through our products and services may result in a shift in market shares, as customers instead choose products
and services offered by our competitors. This may result in lower sales revenue, materially and adversely affecting our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

31 

We
may not be able to manage the growth of our business and our expansion plans and operations or implement our business strategies on schedule
or within our budget, or at all. 

We
are continually executing a number of growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans designed to enhance our business. In 2023 we
plan to increase our revenue stream from health solution advisory services from our ATP Zeta Health Program , ENERGETIQUE 
and BEAUNIQUE series to align with our growth strategies. Any expansion may increase the complexity of our operations and
place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, financial and human resources. Our current and planned personnel, systems,
procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively
manage our growth or to implement all these systems, procedures and control measures successfully. Furthermore, the anticipated benefits
from these growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Moreover, we
may not be able to successfully complete these growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans and realize all of the benefits that
we expect to achieve or it may be more costly to do so than we anticipate. If, for any reason, we are not able to manage our growth effectively,
the benefits we realize are less than our estimates or the implementation of these growth initiatives, strategies and operating plans
adversely affects our operations or costs more or takes longer to effectuate than we expect, and/or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate,
our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. 

In
addition, we may seek and pursue opportunities through joint ventures or strategic partnerships for expansion from time to time, and
we may face similar risks and uncertainties as listed above. Failure to properly address these risks and uncertainties may materially
and adversely affect our ability to carry out acquisitions and other expansion plans, integrate and consolidate newly acquired or newly
formed businesses, and realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of such expansion, which may have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We
have a limited operating history in the Malaysia health and wellness industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. 

We
launched our ATP Zeta Super Health Program business in June 2016, the same month in which our Company was incorporated, followed by our
ENERGETIQUE and BEAUNIQUE series in July 2018 and March 2019, respectively, and thus, we have a limited operating
history. We have limited experience in most aspects of our business operation, such as sourcing products for and offering advisory services
on all the three programs. As our business develops and as we respond to competition, we may continue to introduce new product and services
offerings and make adjustments to our existing product line and services and to our business operation in general. Any significant change
to our business model that does not achieve expected results may have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results
of operations. It is therefore difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. 

The
Malaysia health and wellness industry may not develop as expected. Prospective retail and corporate customers may not be familiar with
the development of the market and may have difficulties distinguishing our products from those of our competitors. Convincing prospective
customers or distributors of the value of our products or services is important to the success of our business. The risk of failing to
convince potential customers or distributors to purchase products or services from us may result in the failure of our business plan.
Many customers or distributors may not be interested in purchasing products and services we sell because there is no certainty that our
business will succeed. 

You
should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and challenges we encounter or may encounter given the rapidly evolving
market in which we operate and our limited operating history. These risks and challenges include our ability to, among other things: 

manage
 our future growth; 
 
 increase
 the utilization of our products by existing and new customers; 
 
 maintain
 and enhance our relationships with customers and distributors; 
 
 improve
 our operational efficiency; 
 
 attract,
 retain and motivate talented employees; 
 
 cope
 with economic fluctuations; 
 
 navigate
 the evolving regulatory environment; and 
 
 defend
 ourselves against legal and regulatory actions. 

Our
historical growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. If we are unable to manage the growth and increased complexity of
our business, fail to control our costs and expenses, or fail to execute our strategies effectively, our business and business prospects
may be materially and adversely affected. 

32 

Our
historical growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth, and we may not be able to generate similar growth rates in future
periods. Our revenue growth may slow, or our total revenues may decline for a number of possible reasons, including change in consumers 
preferences, changes in regulations and government policies, increasing competition, emergence of alternative business models, and general
economic conditions. 

Our
total revenues increased by approximately 82.6 from approximately 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately
 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our gross profit increased by
approximately 65.4 from approximately 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 1.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. 

If
our growth rate declines, investors perceptions of our business and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected
and the market price of our shares could decline. 

Our
lack of insurance could expose us to significant costs and business disruption. 

The
health and wellness industry in Malaysia is a mature market. We currently do not have any product liability or disruption insurance to
cover our operations in Malaysia or overseas, which, based on public information available to us relating to Malaysia-based health and
wellness companies, is consistent with customary industry practice in Malaysia. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these
risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have
such insurance. If we suffer any losses, damages or liabilities in the course of our business operations, we may not have adequate insurance
coverage to provide sufficient funds to cover any such losses, damages or product claim liabilities. Therefore, there may be instances
when we will sustain losses, damages and liabilities because of our lack of insurance coverage, which may in turn materially and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

A
decline in general economic condition could lead to reduced consumer demand and could negatively impact our business operation and financial
condition, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
operating and financial performance may be adversely affected by a variety of factors that influence the general economy. Consumer spending
habits, including spending for health-related products and services we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic
conditions, levels of unemployment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence
and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable
income. In the event of an economic slowdown, consumer spending habits could be adversely affected and we could experience lower net
sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

We
may be adversely affected by the performance of third-party contractors. 

We
engaged third-party contractors to carry out logistics services. We endeavor to engage third-party companies with a strong reputation
and track record, high performance reliability and adequate financial resources. However, any such third-party contractor may still fail
to provide satisfactory logistics services at the level of quality or within the timeframe required by us or our customers. While we
generally require our logistics contractors to fully reimburse us for any losses arising from delay in delivery or non-delivery, our
results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected if any of the losses are not borne by them. If the performance
of any third-party contractor is not satisfactory, we may need to replace such contractor or take other remedial actions, which could
adversely affect the cost structure and delivery schedule of our products and services and thus have a negative impact on our reputation,
financial position and business operations. In addition, as we expand our business into overseas markets, there may be a shortage of
third-party contractors that meet our quality standards and other selection criteria in such locations and, as a result, we may not be
able to engage a sufficient number of high-quality third-party contractors in a timely manner, which may adversely affect our delivery
schedules and delivery costs and hence our business, results of operations and financial conditions. 

33 

We
may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

There
is no guarantee that in the future we will generate enough profits to support our business. Although we believe that our anticipated
cash flows from operating activities together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements
and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months, we cannot assure you this will be the case. We
may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments. We may also need
additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure
or similar actions. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the
time, we may seek to issue equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result
in further dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result
in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. 

Adverse
developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our
operations are focused on utilizing our sales efforts which are principally located in Malaysia. As a result, our results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our products in Malaysia. Due to the lack of broad diversification in industry
type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the industry, or our existing areas of operation, could
have a significantly greater impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified. 

An
overall decline in the health of the economy and other factors impacting consumer spending, such as natural disasters, outbreak of viruses,
illnesses, infectious diseases, contagions and the occurrence of unforeseen epidemics may affect consumer purchases, reduce demand for
our products and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our
business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer confidence
and spending, including but not limited to, general current and future economic and political conditions, consumer disposable income,
recession and fears of recession, unemployment, minimum wages, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, interest rates,
tax rates and policies, inflation, war and fears of war, inclement weather, natural disasters, terrorism, active shooter situations,
outbreak of viruses, illnesses, infectious diseases, contagions and the occurrence of unforeseen epidemics (including the outbreak of
the coronavirus and its potential impact on our financial results) and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. For
example, in recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various countries, including Malaysia. Recently, there was an outbreak
of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including Malaysia. In March 2020,
the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. The epidemic has resulted in intermittent quarantines, travel restrictions,
and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in Malaysia. 

Substantially
all of our revenues are concentrated in Malaysia. Consequently, our results of operations were adversely affected as a result of the
implementation of Movement Control Order (MCO) by the Malaysian government. The impact on the company as a result of the MCO includes: 

temporary
 closure of offices and travel restrictions prevented the company and our distributors from
 organizing offline events, which in turn stalled our marketing effort; 

temporary
 suspension of product supplies to our distributors and members due supply chain disruption
 as our suppliers and logistics providers faced disruption and delay in their operation; and 

the
 COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a decline in overall economic environment, which in turn
 lower the spending power of the consumer and consequently, the revenue of the company. 

Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus
cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. There is no guarantee that our total revenues will grow or remain at the similar level year
over year in the fiscal year 2023. We may have to record downward adjustments or impairment in the fair value of investments in the fiscal
year 2023, if conditions have not been significantly improved and global stock markets have not recovered from recent declines. 

34 

In
general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, pandemic or, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19,
avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, Ebola virus, severe weather conditions such as flood
or hazardous air pollution, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic, severe weather conditions, or other outbreaks, government
and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary
closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our partners to make internal adjustments, including
but not limited to, temporarily closing down business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with
clients and partners for a prolonged period of time. Various impact arising from a severe condition may cause business disruption, resulting
in material, adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations. 

Fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 

We
earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including Australian
Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit and the Hong Kong Dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must
translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at
the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our
net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot assure you
that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies would
not materially affect our financial results. 

Our
business depends on the continued contributions made by Mr. How Kok Choong, as our key executive officer, the loss of who may result
in a severe impediment to our business. 

Our
success is dependent upon the continued contributions made by our CEO and President, Mr. How Kok Choong. We rely on his expertise in
business operations when we are developing our business. We have no Key Man insurance to cover the resulting losses in
the event that any of our officer or directors should die or resign. 

If
Mr. How Kok Choong cannot serve the Company or is no longer willing to do so, the Company may not be able to find alternatives in a timely
manner or at all. This would likely result in a severe damage to our business operations and would have an adverse material impact on
our financial position and operating results. To continue as a viable operation, the Company may have to recruit and train replacement
personnel at a higher cost. Additionally, if Mr. How Kok Choong joins our competitors or develops similar businesses that are in competition
with our Company, our business may also be negatively impacted. 

Our
future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified long-term staff to fill management, technology, sales, marketing,
and customer services positions. We have a great need for qualified talent, but we may not be successful in attracting, hiring, developing,
and retaining the talent required for our success. 

If
we are not able to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected. 

We
have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives were based on, among other things, our
evaluation of our growth prospects, which are generally driven by the sales potential of many product types, some of which are more profitable
than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. There can be no assurance that we will realize the sales potential
and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives. 

We
face risks related to health epidemics, severe weather conditions and other outbreaks. 

In
recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various countries, including Malaysia. Recently, there was an outbreak of a novel
strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including Malaysia. In March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. The epidemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure
of stores and facilities in Malaysia for prolong periods. 

35 

Substantially
all of our revenues are concentrated in Malaysia. Consequently, our results of operations will likely be adversely, and may be materially,
affected, to the extent that the COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms the Malaysia and global economy in general. Any potential impact
to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and
severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact,
almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following: 

temporary
 closure of offices, travel restrictions, financial impact of our customers or suspension supplies may negatively affect, and could
 continue to negatively affect, the demand for our products; 

our
 customer may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all, which could significantly increase the amount of accounts
 receivable and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts. We may have to provide significant sales incentives
 to our sole customer during the outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results; 

any
 disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including
 causing us or our suppliers to cease manufacturing for a period of time or materially delay delivery to our customers, which may
 also lead to loss of our customers; and 

the
 global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant decline from the COVID-19 outbreak and the marketable
 securities that we have invested in could be materially adversely affected, which may lead to significant impairment in the fair
 values of our investments and in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 

Risks
Related to our Industry 

Our
business and reputation may be affected by product liability claims, litigation, customer complaints, product tampering, food safety
issues, food-borne illnesses, health threats, quality control concerns or adverse publicity relating to our products. Product liability
insurance of our supplier may not cover our liability sufficiently or at all. 

Like
other consumer product manufacturers, sale of our products involves an inherent risk of our products being found to be unfit for consumption
or cause illness. Products may be rendered unfit for consumption due to raw materials or product contamination or degeneration, presence
of microbials, illegal tampering of products by unauthorized third parties or other problems arising during the various stages of the
procurement, production, transportation and storage processes. The occurrence of such problems may result in customer complaints, fines,
penalties or adverse publicity causing serious damage to our reputation and brand, as well as product liability claims, other legal disputes
and loss of revenues. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall our products. Even if a situation does not necessitate
a product recall, we cannot assure you that product liability claims or other legal disputes will not be asserted against us as a result.
Product liability insurance of our supplier may not cover our liability sufficiently or at all and will not cover liability that arises
out of our default such as mishandling, poor storage condition and/or contamination of the products by us. As a result, a product liability
or other judgment against us, or a product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. 

36 

Our
business is susceptible to food-borne illnesses. We cannot assure you that we are able to effectively prevent all diseases or illnesses
caused by our products or contamination of our products. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party product suppliers means that food-borne
illness incidents could be caused by our suppliers outside of our control. New illnesses may develop in the future, or diseases with
long incubation periods could arise that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Reports in the media of instances
of food-borne illnesses or health threats of our products or any of their major ingredients could adversely and significantly affect
our sales, and have significant negative impact on our results of operations. This risk exists even if it were later determined that
the illness or health threat in fact was not caused by our products. 

In
addition, adverse publicity about health and safety concerns, whether unfounded or not, may discourage consumers from buying our products.
Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our
products caused personal injury or illness could adversely affect our reputation and our corporate and brand image. If consumers were
to lose confidence in our brand and reputation, we could suffer long-term or even permanent declines in our sales and results of operation.
The amount of negative news, customers complaints and claims against us may also be very costly and may divert our management s
attention from our business operation. 

We
operate in a highly competitive market. If we do not compete effectively, our prospects, operating results, and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected . 

The
health and wellness market in Malaysia is a mature and a highly competitive market, with companies offering a variety of competitive
products and services. We expect competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or
enhanced products and services that are potentially more competitive than our products and services. The health and wellness market has
a multitude of participants in the domestic market, including, but not limited, to retail health supplement providers, pharmaceutical
companies, and network marketing company which supply health supplement products, such as Elken Group, USANA Group, NHF Group, Young
Living, Jeunesse Global Holdings LLC, USA, Shaklee Corporation, VASAYO LLC, Amway Corporation, Sami Direct, Ky ni, Inc., Melaleuca,
Inc. 

We
believe many of our competitors and potential competitors may have significant competitive advantages, including but not limited to,
longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products
and services, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers, greater brand recognition,
ability to leverage stores which they may operate, and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution, and other
capabilities and resources than we do. Our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products and services that
are equal or more superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, and increase sales by utilizing
different distribution channels than we do. Some of our competitors may aggressively discount their products in order to gain market
share, which could result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share, or a failure to grow market share for us.
If we are not able to compete effectively against our current or potential competitors, our prospects, operating results, and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

Risks
Related to Doing Business in Malaysia 

Developments
in the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Malaysia may have a material adverse impact on us. 

Our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by social, political, regulatory and economic
developments in Malaysia. Such political and economic uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks of war, terrorism, nationalism,
nullification of contract, changes in interest rates, imposition of capital controls and methods of taxation. 

Negative
developments in Malaysia s socio-political environment may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. The Malaysian economy registered modest growth of approximately 8.7 and 3.1 in 2022 and 2021 respectively, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia. Although the overall Malaysian economic environment
(in which we predominantly operate) appears to be positive, there can be no assurance that this will continue to prevail in the
future. Economic growth is determined by countless factors, and it is extremely difficult to predict with any level of absolute
certainty. 

37 

Furthermore,
on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization or WHO declared the corona virus or COVID-19 a pandemic. To help counter the
transmission of COVID-19, from March 18, 2020 to April 26, 2022, the government of Malaysia initiated (i) Movement control orders MCO ), . The MCO had resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities
in Malaysia. (ii) Conditional Movement Control Order CMCO where most business sectors were allowed to operate under
strict rules and Standard Operating Procedures mandated by the government of Malaysia. (iii) Recovery Movement Control Order RMCO ). At the height of the pandemic, on January 12, 2021, the Malaysian government even declared a state of
emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. On April 27, 2022, the Malaysian government announced the country had entered into the
endemic phase with further easing of restrictions. We are witnessing the adverse impact on the purchasing power of consumers in
Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold as a direct result of the prolonged pandemic. A such, the extent to which the
coronavirus may continue to adversely impact the Malaysian economy is uncertain. In the event that the Malaysia economy suffers,
demand for our products may diminish, which would in turn result in our profitability. This could in turn result in a substantial
need for restructuring of our business objectives and could result in a partial or entire loss of an investment in our
Company. 

We
are subject to foreign exchange control policies in Malaysia. 

The
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us may be restricted by the foreign exchange control policies
in the countries where we operate. For example, there are foreign exchange policies in Malaysia which support the monitoring of capital
flows into and out of the country in order to preserve its financial and economic stability. The foreign exchange policies are administered
by the Foreign Exchange Administration, an arm of Bank Negara Malaysia BNM ), the central bank of Malaysia. The foreign
exchange policies monitor and regulate both residents and non-residents. Under the current Foreign Exchange Administration rules issued
by BNM, non-residents are free to repatriate any amount of funds from Malaysia in foreign currency other than the currency of Israel
at any time (subject to limited exceptions), including capital, divestment proceeds, profits, dividends, rental, fees and interest arising
from investment in Malaysia, subject to any withholding tax. In the event BNM or any other country where we operate introduces any restrictions
in the future, we may be affected in our ability to repatriate dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries in Malaysia or in such
other countries. Since we are a holding company and rely principally on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for our cash
requirements, any restrictions on such dividends or other payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Economic,
market and political developments in the countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 

As
with all organizations that seek to reduce business risks via geographical expansion, the economic, market and political conditions in
other countries, particularly emerging market conditions in Southeast Asia, could have an influence on our business. Any widespread global
financial instability or a significant loss of investor confidence in emerging market economies may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects or reputation. 

Examples
of such external factors or conditions that are outside our control include, but are not limited to the following: 

general
 economic, political and social conditions in Southeast Asian markets; 

consumer
 spending patterns in our key markets; 

currency
 and interest rate fluctuations; 

international
 events and circumstances such as wars, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and political
 instability; and 

changes
 in legal regimes and governmental regulations, such as licensing and approvals, taxation,
 duties and tariffs, in key markets and abroad. 

For
example, the global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies went
into recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 was uneven and the global economy has continued to face new challenges. There
is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the
central banks and financial authorities of some of the world s leading economies, including the United States. For example, in
2013, the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States announced the tapering of its bond-buying program which led to a high degree of volatility
in equity markets and substantial devaluations in the currencies of many emerging economies, including markets where we operate. Economic
conditions in the countries where we operate might be sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic
and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in emerging markets. Furthermore, the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of November 2022, Malaysia ranks #27 in the list of countries with
the highest COVID-19 cases as recorded under the coronavirus statistics of the worldometer . Total COVID-19 cases in Malaysia
hit approximately 4.9 million and associated fatality of 36,566. These figures are huge relative to the small size economy of the country.
We are witnessing the adverse impact on the purchasing power of consumers in Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold as a direct
result of the prolonged pandemic. 

38 

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

Volatility
in our shares price may subject us to securities litigation. 

The
market for our shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may
continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities
class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future,
be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s
attention and resources. 

We
may never be able to pay dividends and are unlikely to do so. 

To
date, we have not paid, nor do we intend to pay in the foreseeable future, dividends on our common stock, even if we become profitable.
Earnings, if any, are expected to be used to advance our activities and for working capital and general corporate purposes, rather than
to make distributions to stockholders. Since we are not in a financial position to pay dividends on our common stock and future dividends
are not presently being contemplated, investors are advised that return on investment in our common stock is restricted to an appreciation
in the share price. The potential or likelihood of an increase in share price is uncertain. 

In
addition, under Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that
our assets will exceed our liabilities after the dividend. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate
sufficient profits. 

Shareholders
may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities. 

Wherever
possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that
the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock or other securities.
In the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests
of our stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and 200,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock
in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or
for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the
trading price of the common stock. We expect we will need to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital
needs, and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities
in the future in conjunction with these capital-raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for
your stock. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller
reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are currently a smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset- backed issuer, or a
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and annual revenues of less than 50.0 million
during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, 
at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our
SEC filings. However, similar to an emerging growth companies , smaller reporting companies are able to provide
simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things,
only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings
due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations
and financial prospects.

Results
of Operation 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

Revenue 

We
generated revenue of 1,856,564, which comprised of revenue from the Company s network marketing business of 1,141,307
(approximately 61.5 ); and revenue from the Company s operations in the provision of complementary health therapies of
 715,257 (approximately 38.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 1,016,962, which the amount was solely
attributable to revenue from the Company s network marketing business for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue from the
Company s network marketing business increased by 124,345 or approximately 12.2 . Total revenue increased by a
significant 839,602 or approximately 82.6 . The increase was predominately due to: (i) the recovery from COVID-19 in Malaysia after
April 2022. The Company made progress in revenue generating as Malaysia, where the Company s operations predominantly reside,
has moved to a COVID-19 endemic phase with minimal restrictions on businesses and people movements in the country; and (ii) the
Company s operations in the provision of complementary health therapies since February 2022. 

43 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to 666,042 as compared to 297,333 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing
a significant increase of 368,709 or approximately 124.0 . The significant increase was in line with the increase in revenue as explained
in the above. 

Cost
of revenue typically comprise of freight-in, cost of goods purchased, packing materials and services acquired. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to 1,190,522, represented a gross margin of approximately 64.1 , as compared
to 719,629 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was equivalent to a gross margin of approximately 70.8 . The decrease in gross
margin was predominantly due to a lower gross margin associated with the provision of complementary health therapies as compared to
the Company s network marketing business; and promotional activities undertaken by the Company to increase revenue from its
network marketing business. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of selling expenses, commission expenses, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful accounts. 

Selling

of 33,268 or approximately 8.4 . The Company s selling expenses typically comprise salaries and benefits expenses, credit card
processing fees and promotional expenses. The decrease in selling expenses was predominantly due to decrease in salaries and benefits
expenses. 

Commission
expenses 

Commission
expenses were 405,351 and 316,267 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 89,084
or approximately 28.2 . The increase in commission expenses was in line with the increase in revenue. 

General
and administrative expenses G A expenses 

G A
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to 1,957,023, as compared to 1,745,734 for the year ended December 31, 2021,
representing an increase of 211,289, or approximately 12.1 . The increase in G A expenses was mainly due to G A expenses associated
with the provision of complementary health therapies. The Company s G A expenses typically comprise of salaries and benefits
expenses, rental expenses, professional expenses and depreciation expenses.

Provision
for doubtful accounts 

Provision
for doubtful accounts were 0 and 121,514 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts was in respect of prepayments to a supplier. As the Company s attempts to recover the prepayments were futile,
the entire provision for doubtful accounts of 121,514 was written-off during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Other
(Expenses) Income 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an amount of 136,868 as other expenses, net as compared to 529,045 other expenses,
net for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a significant decrease of 392,177, or approximately 74.1 , in other expenses, net.
The net other expenses of 136,868 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 comprised of other expenses of 79,539,
interest income of 16,190 and unrealized holding loss on marketable securities of 73,519. The net other expenses of 529,405
incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprised of other expense of 68,323, interest income of 25,570, unrealized
holding loss on marketable securities of 505,231 and dividend income from marketable securities of 18,939. The significant decrease of other expenses, net was mainly due to the decrease of unrealized holding loss on marketable
securities as a result of market price changes during the year of those investments held by the Company. 

Benefit of (Provision
for) Income Taxes 

We
had benefits of income taxes of 4,055 and provision for income taxes of 137,067 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our operations in Malaysia recorded benefits of income taxes due to reversal
of overprovision of taxes in prior years. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, we had provision for income taxes of 114,862 due to certain permanent items required for the income
taxes provision in Malaysia jurisdiction after our Malaysia local tax audit and had provision for income taxes of 22,205 on U.S. GILTI
taxes provision. 

Net Loss 

We
generated a net loss of 1,666,079 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2,524,680 for the year ended
December 31, 2021, a decrease of 858,601 or approximately 34.0 , predominately due to reasons as discussed above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Malaysia,
where the operations of the Company predominantly reside, officially transitioned to the endemic phase of COVID-19 effective April 1,
2022. Restrictions on businesses and people are minimal. Meanwhile, the government continues to encourage inoculation for those between
the ages of 5 to 11 years and its adolescent group which comprised those between the ages 12 and 17. Adults who have been fully vaccinated,
i.e. received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are encouraged to take booster shots. 

Substantially
all of our revenues are concentrated in Malaysia. Consequently, our results of operations will likely be adversely, and may be materially,
affected, to the extent that the COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms the Malaysia and global economy in general. Any potential impact
to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and
severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact,
almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following: 

temporary
 closure of offices, travel restrictions, disruption or suspension of supplies, our customers may be negatively impacted financially
 resulting in which the demand for our products may be adversely affected; 

we
 may have to provide significant sales incentives to our customers during the outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect
 our financial condition and operating results; and 

any
 disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including
 causing us or our suppliers to cease manufacturing for a period of time or materially delay delivery to our customers, which may
 also lead to loss of our customers. 

Albeit
a lengthy 3 years in the COVID-19 pandemic and living alongside COVID-19, there could still be supply chain disruptions. From our experiences
operating under the much-restricted COVID-19 environment, we have modified our methods of operations, to build in sufficient buffer in
the management of inventories. We may experience slight delay in products delivery lead time but barring unforeseen circumstances, the
setback should be temporary. 

45 

We
are currently operating primarily in Malaysia and anticipate expanding into the Asian markets in the future, with a particular focus,
at least initially, on expanding into Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan. We will explore expansion via e-commerce. Now that most nations
are living alongside COVID-19, we will re-assess our plans to set up offices in the countries in which we operate to better service our
customers. 

Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the COVID-19 cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time. There is no guarantee that the Company s total revenues will grow or remain at similar levels
year over year in 2023 and beyond. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of 799,239 consisting of cash and cash in bank of 523,619 and time deposits of
 914,811 as compared to working capital of 2,599,281 consisting of cash and cash in bank of 622,501 and time deposits of
 1,975,347 as of December 31, 2021. The Company had a net loss of 1,666,079 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and accumulated
deficits of 4,945,586 as of December 31, 2022 as compared to net loss of 2,524,680 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and
accumulated deficits of 3,258,687 as of December 31, 2021. 

In
assessing our liquidity and going concern, management is projecting that the company s revenue will revert to pre-pandemic level,
generating sufficient cash therefrom to cover our operating expenses. 

If
our Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow within the normal operating cycle of a twelve-month period to pay for its future
payment obligations, we may have to consider supplementing our available sources of funds through the following sources: 

other
 available sources of financing from Malaysia banks and other financial institutions; and 

financial
 support from our related parties and shareholders. 

Based
on the above initiatives, management is of the opinion that the Company shall have sufficient funds to meet its working capital
requirements and debt obligations as they become due in the foreseeable future twelve months from the date of issuance of this
Annual Report. However, there is no assurance that management will be successful in its plans. 

The
following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements include
allowance for inventories obsolescence, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for deferred tax assets. Following
are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates. 

47 

Estimated
allowance for inventories obsolescence 

Management
reviews inventory on hand for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable items, as compared to future demand requirements and the shelf life
of the various products. Based on the review, the Company records inventory write-downs, when necessary, when costs exceed expected net
realizable value. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognize an inventory write-downs of 5,307 and 36,241,
respectively. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

Operating
right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. In determining
whether an asset is impaired, the Company has to exercise judgment and make estimation, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event
has occurred or any indicators that may affect the asset value; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the recoverable
amount, in the case of value in use, the present value of future cash flows which are estimating the recoverable amounts including cash
flow projections and an appropriate discount rate. Changing the assumptions and estimates, including the discount rates or the growth
rate in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the net present value used in the impairment test. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amounts of operating right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment is amounted to
 81,133 and 142,149 (December 31, 2021: 237,718 and 215,799), respectively. No impairment losses on operating right-of-use assets
and property, plant and equipment were recognized as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Recognition
of income taxes and allowance for deferred tax assets/liabilities 

The
Company conducts much of its business activities in Malaysia and Hong Kong and is subject to tax in each of these jurisdictions. Significant
estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which
such determination is made. 

Deferred
tax assets relating to certain temporary differences and tax losses are recognized as management considers it is probable that future
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences or tax losses can be utilized. Where the expectation is different
from the original estimate, such differences will impact the recognition of deferred taxation assets and taxation in the periods in which
such estimate is changed. 

48 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606). The core
principle underlying the revenue recognition of this ASU allows the Company to recognize - revenue that represents the transfer of goods
and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange.
This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a
point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company s revenue streams
are recognized at a point in time for the Company s sale of health and wellness products. 

The
ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company
(i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
the performance obligation. 

The
Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment
terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of substantially collection. 

Sales
of Health and Wellness products 

-
Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

The
Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when control of the health and wellness
products are transferred to its customer at the Company s office or shipment of the goods. The revenue is recorded net of estimated
discounts and return allowances. Products are given 60 days for returns or exchanges from the date of purchase. Historically, there were
insignificant sales returns. 

Under the Company s network marketing business, the Company issues
product coupons to members and distributors when these customers made purchases above certain thresholds set by the Company. Depending
on the type of product coupons issued, the coupons carry varying values and can be used by the customers for reduction in the transaction
price of product purchases within the coupon validity period. The value of the product coupons issued is recorded as a reduction of the
Company s revenue account upon issuance; the corresponding amount credited to the customer deposits account. Amounts in customer
deposits will be reversed when the coupons are used. The Company s coupons have a validity period of between six and twelve months.
If the Company s customers did not utilize the coupons after the validity period, the Company would recognize the forfeiture of
the originated sales value of the coupons as net revenues. 

Provision
of Health and Wellness services 

-
 Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

The
Company carries out its Wellness program, where the Company s products are bundled with health screening test and a health camp
program. The health screening test and the health camp programs are considered as separate performance obligations. The promises to deliver
the health screening test report and the attendance at the health camp are separately identifiable, which are evidenced by the fact that
the Company provides separate services of delivering the health screening test report and allowing admission of the customers to attend
the health camp. The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the test
reports are completed and delivered to its customers during the consultation section in person. The Company also separately derives its
revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the health camp program was completed in the final
day of the health camp. 

49 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The
accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and
requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. 

The
accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance
disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow: 

Level
 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level
 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
 are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level
 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. 

Financial
instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost,
which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization
and their current market rates of interest. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued. 

In
November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit
organizations and certain smaller reporting companies applying for credit losses, leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date
for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact ASUs 2016-13 and 2019-05 may have on its consolidated financial statements. 

Except
for the above-mentioned pronouncements, there are no new recent issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on the consolidated
financial position, statements of operations and cash flows. 

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Foreign
exchange risk . Substantially most of our revenues are denominated in the Malaysian Ringgit while most of our expenses are denominated
in Malaysian Ringgit, U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange
risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments. Although in general,
our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of an investment in our Common Stock may be affected by the foreign
exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Malaysian Ringgit; and U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar because the value of our business is effectively
denominated in Malaysian Ringgit and Hong Kong Dollar, while the Common Stock is traded in U.S. dollars. 

Credit
risk . Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes
the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively
short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on the foregoing evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

51 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As
of December 31, 2022, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such evaluation, the Company s management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, internal controls
and procedures over financial reporting were not effective. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our
internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

Identified
Material Weakness 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, identified the following material weakness during its assessment of
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022: 

(i)
insufficient full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily recording of transactions,
address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii)
lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the preventive internal control procedures
and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that the Company s policies and procedures have
been carried out as planned; (iii) lack of proper IT policies and procedures developed for system change management, backup management, user access management and service organization
management. 

52 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we will prepare written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC
guidelines, to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including
equity and debt transactions. 

To
further strengthen the Company s internal controls, we plan to initiate the following measures going forward: 

1. 
 We
 intend to establish an internal audit function with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of overall
 internal control. 

2. 
 Once
 we hire additional employees, we intend to initiate a comprehensive training program and development plan to provide ongoing company-wide
 trainings regarding internal control and requirements of U.S. GAAP financial statements and related disclosures, with particular
 emphasis on our accounting staff. 

3. 
 Hire suitable IT personnel to develop and implement proper IT policies
and procedures for system change management, backup management and service organization management. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2023. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report,
which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND (CONT D) 

Business
Overview 

Agape
ATP Corporation is a company that provides health and wellness products and health solution advisory services to our clients. The Company
primarily focus its efforts on attracting customers in Malaysia. Its advisory services center on the ATP Zeta Health Program ,
which is a health program designed to effectively prevent diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy
lifestyles, and promotion of health. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity in our clients through a combination of
modern medicine, proper nutrition and advice from skilled nutritionists and/or dieticians. 

In
order to strengthen the Company s supply chain, on May 8, 2020, the Company has successfully acquired approximately of ASL,
with the goal of securing an established network marketing sales channel that has been established in Malaysia for the past 15 years.
ASL has been offering the Company s ATP Zeta Health Program as part of its product lineup. As such, the acquisition creates synergy
in the Company s operation by boosting the Company s retail and marketing capabilities. The newly acquired subsidiary allows
the Company to fulfill its mission of helping people to create health and wealth by providing a financially rewarding business
opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and customers who seek a healthy lifestyle. 

Via
ASL, the Company offers three series of programs which consist of different services and products: ATP Zeta Health Program, NERG TIQUE
and BEAUNIQUE. 

The
ATP Zeta Health Program is a health program designed to promote health and general wellbeing designed to prevent health diseases caused
by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy lifestyles. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity
through a combination of modern health supplements, proper nutrition and advice from skilled dieticians as well as trained members and
distributors. 

The
 NERG TIQUE series aims to provide a total dermal solution for a healthy skin beginning from the cellular level. The series
is comprised of the Energy Mask series, Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Mousse Facial Cleanser. 

The
BEAUNIQUE product series focuses on the research of our diet s impact on modifying gene expressions in order to address genetic
variations and deliver a nutrigenomic solution for every individual. 

The
Company deems creating public awareness on wellness and wellbeing lifestyle as essential to enhance the provision of its health solution
advisory services; and therefore, incorporated WATP. Upon its establishment, WATP started collaborating with ASL to carry out various
wellness programs. 

To
further its reach in the Health and Wellness Industry, on November 11, 2021, Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan) formed a joint-venture entity,
DSY Wellness International Sdn. Bhd. DSY Wellness with an independent third party which Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan)
owns of the equity interest, to pursue the business of providing complementary health therapies .

reports are completed and delivered to its customers during the consultation section in person.

Lease
terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease,
as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers
the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected
the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve
months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The
Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews
the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the
asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset
from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount
of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and includes the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future
pre-tax cash flows.

 The

The
Company also leased one office and operation center, and one shophouse with an expiring term of twelve months or less, which were classified
as operation leases. Since the lease terms for these leases were twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to elect not to recognize
lease assets and liabilities. The Company has elected not to recognize lease assets and liabilities on these leases. As of December 31,
2022, the Company s commitment for minimum lease payment under these operating leases within the next twelve months were .

Contingencies 

Legal 

From
time to time, the Company is party to certain legal proceedings, as well as certain asserted and un-asserted claims. Amounts accrued,
as well as the total amount of reasonably possible losses with respect to such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not deemed
to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

COVID-19 

Malaysia,
where the operations of the Company predominantly reside, officially transitioned to the endemic phase of COVID-19 effective April 1,
2022. Restrictions on businesses and people are minimal. Meanwhile, the government continues to encourage inoculation for those between
the ages of 5 and 11 years and its adolescent group which comprised those between the ages 12 and 17. Adults who have been fully vaccinated,
i.e. received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are encouraged to take booster shots. 

Substantially
all of our revenues are concentrated in Malaysia. Consequently, our results of operations will likely be adversely, and may be materially,
affected, to the extent that the COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms the Malaysia and global economy in general. Any potential impact
to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and
severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact,
almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following: 

temporary
 closure of offices, travel restrictions, disruption or suspension of supplies, our customers may be negatively impacted financially
 resulting in which the demand for our products may be adversely affected ; 

we
 may have to provide significant sales incentives to our customers during the outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect
 our financial condition and operating results ; and 

any
 disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including
 causing us or our suppliers to cease manufacturing for a period of time or materially delay delivery to our customers, which may
 also lead to loss of our customers. 

Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the COVID-19 cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time. There is no guarantee that the Company s total revenues will grow or remain at similar levels
year over year in 2023 and beyond.
