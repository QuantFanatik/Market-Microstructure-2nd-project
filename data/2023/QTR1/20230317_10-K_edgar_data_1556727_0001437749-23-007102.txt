Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain matters in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K"), including information included or incorporated by reference, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are not historical facts, and other statements often identified by words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," or similar expressions. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors: 

the risks associated with lending and potential adverse changes in the credit quality of loans in our portfolio, particularly with respect to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or climate change 

legislative or regulatory changes, including expanded consumer protection regulation and responses to inflation and climate change issues, which could adversely affect the Company's business; 

a continued decrease in the market demand for loans that we originate for sale; 

our ability to control operating costs and expenses; 

whether our management team can implement our operational strategy, including but not limited to our efforts to achieve loan and revenue growth; 

our ability to successfully execute on merger and/or acquisition strategies and integrate any newly acquired assets, liabilities, customers, systems, and management personnel into our operations and our ability to realize related cost savings within expected time frames; 

our ability to successfully execute on growth strategies related to our entry into new markets and delivery channels, including banking as a service; 

our ability to develop user-friendly digital applications to serve existing customers and attract new customers; 

the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; 

changes in monetary policy and fiscal policies including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, and the relative differences between short and long-term interest rates, deposit interest rates, our net interest margin and funding sources; 

increased competitive pressures among financial services companies, particularly from non-traditional banking entities such as challenger banks, fintech, and mega technology companies; 

our ability to attract and retain deposits at a reasonable cost; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, resulting in reduced demand for banking products and services, particularly in the event of a recession that affects our market areas; 

results of examinations of us by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Department of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, or other regulatory authorities, which could result in restrictions that may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings; 

disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; 

the impacts related to or resulting from Russia's military action in Ukraine, including the broader impacts to financial markets and economic conditions; 

any failure of key third-party vendors to perform their obligations to us; 

the effects of any reputational damage to the Company resulting from any of the foregoing; and 

other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services and other risks described elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including risks discussed under "Item 1.A. -- Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K.

In December 2022, in connection with termination of the joint venture agreement, Quin Ventures sold substantially all of its assets, including intellectual property, to Quil Ventures, Inc. Quil ).

As part of the transaction, First Northwest received a 5 ownership stake in Quil. First Northwest retains a 50 equity interest in Quin Ventures and will receive a portion of Quil s monthly subscription fee income, the value of which is reflected as a commitment receivable under "Other Assets."

Key employment sectors include aerospace, military, information technology, biotechnology, education, logistics, international trade, and tourism. The region is well known for the long-term presence of The Boeing Company and Microsoft, two major industry leaders, and since the turn of the century, Amazon.com. The military presence includes a number of large installations serving the U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy. Given the employment profile and the presence of the University of Washington and other universities, the region's workforce is highly educated. Washington's geographic proximity to the Pacific Rim along with a deep-water port makes it a center for international trade, which contributes significantly to the regional economy. The local ports make Washington the ninth largest exporting state in the nation. The top five trading partners with Washington include China, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Mexico. Tourism has also developed into a major industry, due to the scenic beauty, temperate climate, and incredible food and culture. The maritime industry, supported by the trade and fishing industries, is also an important employment sector.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2022, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (excluding loans held for sale) totaled 343.8 million, or 22.4 , of our total loan portfolio, including 23.9 million, or 7.0 , of loans secured by properties outside the state of Washington, primarily purchased loans in the state of California. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate residential loans, which can be sold in the secondary market or retai ned in our portfolio, and supplement those originations with loan purchases from time to time, depending on our balance sheet objectives. Residential loans are underwritten to either secondary market standards for sale or to internal underwriting standards, which may not meet Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") eligibility requirements. 
 
 Fixed-rate residential mortgages are offered with repayment terms between 10 and 30 years, priced from Freddie Mac posted daily pricing indications adjusted for economic and competitive considerations. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage products with similar amortization terms are also offered, with an interest rate that is typically fixed for an initial period ranging from one to seven years with annual adjustments thereafter. Future interest rate adjustments include periodic caps of no more than 2 and lifetime caps of 5 to 6 above the initial interest rate, with no borrower prepayment restrictions. 
 
 Adjustable-rate mortgage loans could increase credit risk when interest rates rise. An increase to the borrower's loan payment may affect the borrower's ability to repay and could increase the probability of default. To mitigate this risk to both the borrower and First Fed, adjustable-rate loans contain both periodic and lifetime interest rate caps, limiting the amount of payment changes. In addition, depending on market conditions, we may underwrite the borrower at a higher interest rate and payment amount than the initial rate. At December 31, 2022, the average interest rate on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans was approximately 367 basis points under the fully indexed rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had 90.5 million, or 26.3 , o f adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans in our residential loan portfolio. 
 
 The underwriting process considers a variety of factors including credit history, debt to income ratios, property type, loan to value ratio, and occupancy. For loans with over 80 loan to value ratios, we typically require private mortgage insurance, which reduces our exposure to loss in the event of a loan default. Credit risk is also mitigated by obtaining title insurance, hazard insurance, and flood insurance. Residential mortgage loans which require appraisals are appraised by independent fee-based appraisers. 
 
 In connection with rules and regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), we are required to make a reasonable, good-faith determination before or when we consummate a mortgage loan that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, and in some cases involving qualified mortgages, we are presumed to have complied with this requirement. We believe that mortgage loans originated by the bank meet these standards. 
 
 First Fed does not actively engage in subprime mortgage lending, either through advertising, marketing, underwriting and/or risk selection, and has no established program to originate or purchase subprime mortgage loans. 
 
 Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2022, 390.3 million, or 25.5 , and 253.6 million, or 16.5 , of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate property, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we have identified 102.0 million, or 15.9 , of our commercial and multi-family real estate portfolio as owner-occupied commercial real estate and 541.8 million, or 84.1 , is secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied, commercial and multi-family real estate. Over 95 of our commercial real estate and multi-family loans are secured by properties located in the state of Washington.

Table of Contents 

Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than one- to four-family residential loans, to compensate for the greater risk associated with higher loan balances and the complexity of underwriting and monitoring these loans. Repayment on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties is dependent on successful management by the property owner to create sufficient net operating income to meet debt service requirements. Changes in economic and real estate market conditions can affect net operating income, capitalization rates, and ultimately the valuation and marketability of the collateral. As a result, we analyze market data including vacancy rates, absorption percentages, leasing rates, and competing projects under development. Interest rate, occupancy and capitalization rate stress testing are required as part of our underwriting analysis. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from principals, which include underwriting of their personal financial statements, tax returns, cash flows and individual credit reports, to provide us with additional support and a secondary source for repayment of the debt. 
 
 We offer both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans on commercial and multi-family real estate, which may include balloon payments. As of December 31, 2022, we had 241.6 million in adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans and 153.4 million in adjustable-rate multi-family loans. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans with adjustable rates generally adjust after an initial period of three to five years and have maturity dates of three to ten years. Amortization terms are generally limited to terms up to 25 years on commercial real estate loans and up to 30 years on multi-family loans. Adjustable-rate multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans are generally priced to market indices with appropriate margins, which may include The Wall Street Journal prime rate, the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate, or a similar term FHLB borrowing rate. Adjustable-rate loans could increase credit risk when interest rates rise. An increase to the borrower's loan payment may affect the borrower's ability to repay and could increase the probability of default. To mitigate this risk to both the borrower and First Fed, adjustable-rate loans may contain both periodic and lifetime interest rate caps, limiting the amount of payment changes. 
 
 During 2019, the Bank moved away from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") as a market index in anticipation of its complete sunset in 2023 and in order to mitigate the transition of existing loans tied to LIBOR to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("TSOFR") index. We currently utilize LIBOR on Main Street Lending contracts and floating rate adjustable-rate conversion ("ARC") loans originated in prior years; however, these contracts stipulate that we can use a different index upon the sunset of LIBOR. Of the adjustable-rate commercial and multi-family real estate loans, 67.69 are subject to a floor rate and the weighted average floor rate on these loans was 3.56 at December 31, 2022. Of the adjustable-rate commercial loans, 100.00 are subject to a ceiling rate and the weighted average ceiling rate on those loans was 16.37 at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The maximum loan to value ratio for commercial and multi-family real estate loans is typically limited to 75 of an appraiser opinion of market value. The minimum debt service coverage ratio is 1.25 for non-owner-occupied and owner-occupied properties. We require independent appraisals or evaluations on all loans secured by commercial or multi-family real estate from an approved appraisers list. 
 
 Once commercial real estate or multi-family loans are originated, we review most relationships at least annually to assure the borrower continues to meet certain loan requirements as set forth at origination, which may include an annual inspection of the property. The scope of the review is based on relationship size, with those 1.5 million or greater subject to a full credit review at least annually, which includes detailed financial and cash flow analysis, property inspection, covenant compliance and annual risk rating certification. Relationships 750,000 or greater are subject to brief financial and cash flow analysis, covenant compliance and annual risk rating certification. While we cannot prevent loans from becoming delinquent, we believe our monitoring and formal review processes provide us with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent.

If we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. Vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market factors can result in losses during the time it takes to stabilize a property. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses relating to multi-family and commercial loans can be substantial and unpredictable. 
 
 The average outstanding loan in our commercial real estate portfolio, including multi-family loans, was 1.5 million as of December 31, 2022. We generally target individual commercial and multi-family real estate loans between 1.0 million and 10.0 million to small and mid-size owners and investors in our market areas as well as other parts of Washington. We will also make commercial and multi-family real estate loans in other states if we have a pre-existing relationship with the borrower. 
 
 Our three largest commercial and multi-family borrowing relationships, including current loan balances and unused commitments, at December 31, 2022 consisted of a 21.3 million relationship secured by commercial real estate and business assets in King County, Washington; a 17.7 million relationship secured by multi-family residential and multi-family construction in Benton, Pierce, and Spokane Counties; and a 17.6 million relationship secured by commercial real estate in Kitsap, King and Thurston Counties. 
 
 Construction and Land Lending. Our construction and land loans totaled 194.7 million, or 12.7 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process totaled 120.7 million. 
 
 First Fed offers an "all-in-one" residential custom construction loan product, which upon completion of construction will be held in our loan portfolio . We also originate construction loans for certain commercial real estate projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, subdivisions, multi-family, retail, office, warehouse, hotel, and office buildings. We also offer commercial acquisition-renovation loans that have a small construction component combined with a traditional real estate loan. Underwriting criteria on construction loans include, but are not limited to, minimum debt service coverage requirements of 1.25x or better, loan to value limitations, pre-leasing requirements, construction cost over-run contingency reserves, interest and absorption period reserves, occupancy, capitalization rates and interest rate stress testing, as well as other underwriting criteria. Underwriting criteria on commercial acquisition-renovation loans during the interest-only period include, but are not limited to, loan to value limitations and debt service coverage requirements of 1.00x or better, based on in-place rents and amortization of full commitment. These loans begin amortizing once renovations have been completed. 
 
 Construction loan applications generally require architectural and working plans, a material specifications list, a detailed cost breakdown and a construction contract. Construction loan advances are based on progress payments for "work in place" based on detailed line-item construction budgets. Independent construction inspectors are used to evaluate the construction draw request relative to the progress. Our construction administrator reviews all construction projects, inspection reports, and construction loan advance requests to ensure they are appropriate and in compliance with all loan conditions. Other risk management tools include title insurance, date down endorsements or periodic lien inspections prior to the payment of construction loan advances. In some cases, general contractors may be required to provide sub-contractor lien releases for any work performed prior to the filing of our deed of trust or prior to each construction loan advance. 
 
 Custom and speculative construction valuations are based on the assumption that the project will be built in accordance with plans and specifications submitted to us at the time of the loan application. The appraiser takes into consideration the proposed design and market appeal of the improvements, based on current market conditions and demand for homes, although the improvements may not be completed for twelve months or longer, depending on the complexity of the plans and specifications and market conditions.

Land acquisition, development and construction loans are available to local contractors and developers for the purpose of holding and/or developing residential building sites and homes when market conditions warrant such activity. Land acquisition loans are secured by a first lien on the property and are generally limited to 65 of the acquisition price or the appraised value, whichever is less. Development land loans are generally limited to 75 of the discounted appraised value based on the projected lot sale absorption rate and associated carry and liquidation costs of the developed lots and homes. Underwriting criteria for acquisition and development loans include evidence of preliminary plat approval, and a review of compliance with state and Federal environmental protection and disclosure laws, engineering plans, detailed cost breakdowns and marketing plans. Other risk management tools include acquisition of title insurance and review of feasibility and market absorption reports. These loans have been limited to projects within the state of Washington. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the average construction commitment for single-family residential construction was 872,000, 3.1 million for multi-family construction, 2.4 million for acquisition-renovation loans, and 1.9 million for commercial real estate construction. The largest construction commitments for multi-family, acquisition-renovation, and commercial real estate were 13.9 million, 14.3 million, and 14.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Substantially all of our adjustable-rate land acquisition, development and construction lending have rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed monthly, as is the case for acquisition and development loans. When original interest reserves set up at origination are exhausted, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and it is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate. 
 
 The success of land acquisition, development and construction lending is dependent upon completion of the project and the sale or leasing of the property for repayment of the loan. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates related to construction costs, the market value of the completed project, the demand for the property at completion, market conditions, the rates of interest paid, and other factors, actual results are difficult to predict and variations from expectations can have a significant adverse effect on a borrower's ability to repay loans and the value and marketability of the underlying collateral. In addition, because an incomplete construction project is difficult to sell in the event of default, we may be required to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder in order to complete construction. There is a risk that we may not fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs under these circumstances. Speculative construction loans carry additional risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. In 2020, we implemented an extension fee policy to entice commercial borrowers to finish projects on time, which we believe mitigates risk and enhances the return on these loans. 
 
 We also originate individual lot loans, which are secured by a first lien on the property, for borrowers who are planning to build on the lot within the next five years. Generally, these loans have a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 for improved lands (legal access, water and power). The interest rate on these loans is fixed with a 20-year amortization and a five-year term.

Our construction and land loans are geographically disbursed primarily throughout the state of Washington and, as a result, these loans are susceptible to risks that may be different depending on the location of the project. We manage our construction lending by utilizing a licensed third-party vendor to assist us in monitoring our higher-risk construction projects while lower-risk projects are monitored by internal staff.

Consumer Lending. We offer consumer loans, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and personal lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled 52.3 million, or 3.4 , of the loan portfolio. Our interest rates on home equity loans are priced for risk based on credit score, loan to value and overall capacity of the applicant. Home equity loans are made for the improvement of residential properties and other consumer needs. Some of these loans are secured by first liens; however, the majority of these loans are secured by a second deed of trust on the residential property. Fixed rate, fully amortizing home equity loans in first lien position are available with repayment periods ranging from 5 to 20 years. We also offer, to borrowers who qualify, a ten-year home equity line of credit with an option for a discounted initial fixed interest rate for the first year with the interest rate adjusting monthly thereafter based on a margin over the prime rate; payments are interest-only during the ten-year draw period. The balance and rate are fixed after that period and the principal amortized over the remaining fifteen-year period of the loan. Options for equity loans on non-owner occupied properties are offered under more conservative requirements. Additionally, terms are available under a bridge loan product consisting of a short-term equity loan used to facilitate the acquisition of a separate residential property. Home equity fixed and line of credit products in second lien positions behind a non-First Fed mortgage have a maximum loan amount of 250,000. Home equity loans and lines of credit have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because they are secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property. We may or may not have private mortgage insurance coverage.

At December 31, 2022, auto loans totaled 130.9 million, of which 122.8 million were purchased and 4.8 million were originated through indirect dealer programs described below; the remaining 3.3 million were originated through our branches. Auto loans may have a maximum term of up to 180 months depending on the age and condition of the vehicle and strength of the borrower. Loan rates for auto lending, as well as all other consumer loans, are priced based on the specific loan type and the risks involved. Indirect lending sources are used to purchase auto loans. In-house and direct lending sources have been used to originate auto loans in prior years. 
 
 We purchase auto loans through a partnership with a loan originator that operates in all 50 states, underwriting and funding loans for classic (25 years or older) and collector (premium price with limited production) vehicles. These loans typically range from 10,000 to over 600,000 with terms that range from 84 to 180 months and generally require down payments of 10 to 20 . We receive loan pools each week with complete packages that we are able to underwrite to determine whether to purchase or pass on all loans submitted. These loans present unique risks with the collateral being located across the country; however, our loan originator mitigates risk of loss by providing an option to facilitate the collection efforts should repossession become necessary, for which we would incur a cost if we did it ourselves. Historically, losses on these types of loans have been less than 1 and First Fed experienced a loss rate of 0.06 for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Indirect auto loans were originated with auto dealerships located throughout our market areas through a third-party service provider that also facilitated a portion of the underwriting and origination of these loans based on our underwriting and pricing criteria. During 2020, we ended our relationship with that service provider, effectively eliminating new production. We may, however, work directly with local auto dealerships in the future. Indirect auto loan customers receive a fixed rate loan in an amount and at an interest rate that is based on review of their FICO credit score, age of the vehicle, and loan term. Our underwriting and pricing criteria for indirect auto loans focuses primarily on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan rather than the value of the underlying collateral. The loan term on indirect auto loans averages 70 months, which is comparable to national auto industry data. 
 
 We began purchasing manufactured home loans during 2020 through a partnership with a loan originator that underwrites and funds these loans. At December 31, 2022, 78.3 million of manufactured home loans was included in consumer loans. These loans range from 18,000 to 335,000 with terms that range from 120 to 360 months. We receive loan pools with complete packages that we underwrite to determine whether to purchase or pass on some, or all, of the loans submitted. The seller retains the servicing on these loans. The collateral may include both real estate and personal property depending on whether or not the title to the subject property has been eliminated. A reserve account equal to approximately 8 of the unpaid balance serves as a credit enhancement to help protect against charge offs and prepaid loans. The loan originator has had an average loss rate of 0.6 since 2007 for this program and First Fed has not experienced any loss on these loans to-date. 
 
 Consumer loans represent additional risks because of the mobility and rapidly depreciating nature of consumer assets in contrast to real estate-based collateral. If a borrower defaults, repossession and liquidation of the collateral may not provide sufficient proceeds to satisfy the outstanding loan balance. Other factors that may account for potential loan losses on consumer loans include deferred maintenance and damages. While subsequent legal actions and judgments against borrowers in default may be appropriate, such collection efforts and costs may not always be warranted and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability and federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.

Commercial Business Lending. As of December 31, 2022, commercial business loans totaled 77.0 million, or 5.0 of our loan portfolio. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we provided assistance to many small businesses through the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program ("SBA PPP"). This program provided small businesses with funds to pay up to eight weeks of payroll costs including benefits. A portion of the funds could also be used to pay interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act ("PPPFA") was enacted. Main provisions of the PPPFA extended the repayment period from two to five years, extended the covered expense period from eight to 24 weeks, and lowered the percent of forgiveness amount required to be used for eligible payroll costs to 60 . The PPPFA also extended the repayment start date until after the SBA finalized the application process for loan forgiveness. 
 
 We processed 32.2 million of loans for 515 customers through the SBA PPP program as of December 31, 2020, the average loan amount approved was approximately 63,000. We processed an additional 35.0 million of loans for 427 customers during the second round of SBA PPP funding with an average loan amount of 82,000. Payments by borrowers on these loans begin six months after the note date, and interest, at 1 , continued to accrue during the six-month deferment. Loans can be forgiven in whole or part (up to full principal and any accrued interest). We received 1.8 million and 1.4 million of fee income for loans originated in 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is accreted into income over the life of the loan. The remaining fee balance is taken into income when the loan pays off. We recognized deferred fee income, net of deferred costs, of 377,000 and 1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, through SBA PPP loan accretion and payoff activity. The remaining net deferred fee balance at December 31, 2022, was 13,000. We partnered with a third-party financial technology provider to assist our borrowers with the loan forgiveness application process. SBA PPP loan balances totaling 99,000 were included in commercial business loans at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The remaining balance of commercial business loans includes lines of credit, term loans, and letters of credit used for general business purposes, including seasonal and permanent working capital, equipment financing, and general investments. These loans are typically secured by business assets, and loan terms vary from one to seven years with floating rates indexed to similar FHLB advance rates, The Wall Street Journal prime rate, LIBOR or other indices. These loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. Our commercial business lending underwriting includes an analysis of the borrower s financial condition, past, present and future cash flows, and the collateral pledged as security. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans. We focus our commercial lending activities on small-to-medium sized, privately held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area.

Commercial business loans are originated based on the cash flow of the borrowing entity, which may be unpredictable due to normal business cycles, industry changes, and economic and political conditions. Secondary and tertiary sources of repayment are guarantor cash flows and collateral liquidation. Most often, collateral for commercial business loans consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment. Collateral may fluctuate in value, which can reduce liquidation proceeds, and our ability to collect on accounts receivable or other third-party payments can affect the amount of losses we incur in the event of default. Similar to commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial business relationships of 1.5 million or greater are subject to a formal review of the entire lending relationship at least annually. 
 
 Included in total commercial business loans is 7.0 million of loans originated by First Northwest. These loans may contain clauses which allow for a portion of the debt to be converted into securities, mezzanine debt or other non-standard terms. 
 
 Loan Origination and Underwriting. Our loans are obtained from a variety of sources, including existing or walk-in customers, business development, referrals, and advertising, among others. All of our consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans and secured and unsecured consumer loans, are processed through our centralized processing and underwriting center. Commercial business loans, including commercial and multi-family real estate loans, are originated by our relationship managers ("RMs") and underwritten centrally with credit presentations submitted for approval to the appropriate individuals and committee(s) with lending authority designated by the Board of Directors (the "Board"). 
 
 Lending Authority. Through its current policy, the Board delegates lending authority to the Bank s management and staff and to the Senior Loan Committee ("SLC"). Overdrafts and small business express loans require one signature. The Chief Banking Officer ("CBO") and the Chief Operating Officer ("COO") have the authority to approve overdrafts up to 100,000; the Chief Credit Officer ("CCO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") have the authority to approve overdrafts up to 250,000; and certain other staff and management have authority to approve overdrafts ranging from 5,000 to 50,000. Our small business express loans, which are commercial business loans of 100,000 or less, are approved by the CCO or designated personnel and management. In addition, the CCO may approve Automated Clearing House and Remote Deposit Capture transactions in any amount and has the authority to approve most modifications and extensions of credit in any amount for terms of less than one year. 
 
 Mortgage loan underwriters have approval authority up to 667,000. The Director of Mortgage and Consumer Credit has approval authority of 1.0 million, and the CCO has approval authority of 2.0 million. Mortgage loans over 2.0 million are approved by the SLC. 
 
 For commercial loans, the CCO has approval authority of 10.0 million based on aggregate credit exposure, and other personnel have approval authority ranging from 500,000 to 4.0 million. Commercial loan relationships over 10.0 million are approved by the SLC. 
 
 The Director of Mortgage and Consumer Credit has approval authority for consumer loans up to 1.0 million and certain named individuals have authority ranging from 150,000 to 500,000. Additionally, we have assigned authority to approve indirect auto loans and wholesale partnerships meeting our underwriting and pricing criteria to our third-party service providers. 
 
 The SLC (on a monthly basis) and the Board Loan Committee ("BLC") (on a quarterly basis) review loan portfolio quality, credit concentrations, production, and industry trends and provide directional oversight over our lending policies. The BLC also reviews, on a quarterly basis, policy exceptions, and related risk concerns. Additionally, all loan approval policies are reviewed no less than annually. 
 
 Washington law provides for loans to one borrower restrictions, which restricts total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to 20 of its unimpaired capital and surplus, which was 46.3 million at December 31, 2022. First Fed, however, restricts its loans to one borrower to no more than 60 of the Bank's lending limit, which is adjusted quarterly and was 34.7 million at December 31, 2022, unless specifically approved by the SLC as an exception to policy. The following table provides a summary of our five largest relationships at December 31, 2022.

Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases and Sales . We originate mortgage, consumer, multi-family and commercial real estate, and commercial business loans for our portfolio utilizing fixed- and adjustable-rate loan terms. We also purchase whole and participation loans on a servicing retained or released basis. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our total loan originations were 548.3 million, 780.5 million, and 871.3 million, respectively. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we purchased 96.1 million, 115.5 million, and 88.3 million of loans, respectively. During the last year, the majority of purchases consisted of auto loans purchased through our partnership with an originator specializing in classic and collector vehicles and manufactured home loans purchased through our partnership with an originator specializing in that type of lending. A secondary source of purchased loans were commercial real estate loans and participations, whereby we receive a portion of a loan originated by another lender who retains the servicing and customer relationship and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, retain a portion of the interest as a servicing fee. Loan pools purchased prior to 2018 consisted mainly of loans exceeding conforming loan limits, or "jumbo loans," secured by single family residential properties located in the states of Washington and California. Purchased loans, loan pools, and participations are underwritten by our credit administration department and approved by the appropriate loan committee(s) prior to purchase, according to our lending authority guidelines. We may pay a purchase premium or receive a purchase discount on fully originated loans that we purchase. Premiums and discounts are capitalized at the time of purchase and amortized over the remaining contractual life of the loan. We had 16.0 million, 13.0 million, and 6.1 million of net premiums paid on purchased loans at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 
 The Olympic Peninsula region, which includes a substantial concentration of our depositors, has experienced limited population growth, and the region's unemployment rate is higher than both the state and national unemployment rates. As a result, it has been part of our strategy to originate and purchase loans outside of these areas in the counties surrounding the Puget Sound and elsewhere. As part of that, we may purchase loans with different credit and underwriting criteria than those we originate organically. 
 
 We sell residential first mortgage loans in the secondary market. The majority of residential mortgages we originate are fixed rate, which we may sell to the secondary market to manage our interest rate risk and improve noninterest income. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we sold 26.1 million, 113.0 million, and 184.4 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively. Our secondary market relationship for residential loans is with Freddie Mac and other select third-party purchasers, which provides us greater flexibility in choosing the best pricing, whether we are selling on a servicing retained or released basis. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we were servicing 418.8 million of loans for others. We earned sold loan servicing income of 972,000, 1.0 million, and 424,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Servicing rights for these loans had a fair value of 3.9 million at December 31, 2022. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.

In general, loans are sold on a non-recourse basis to third-party purchasers, subject to a provision for repurchase in the event of a breach of representation, warranty or covenant made at the time of sale. During fiscal 2008, we sold loans with "life of the loan" recourse provisions to Freddie Mac, and beginning in May 2013, Freddie Mac has required loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture to be sold with "life of the loan" recourse provisions as well. These recourse provisions require us to repurchase the loan upon default. The balance of loans serviced for others with life of the loan recourse provisions was 1.9 million at December 31, 2022. There were no loans repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 
 We may solicit one or more financial institutions to take a portion of a commercial real estate loan in order to manage risk, concentrations, or to generate income through gain on sale or servicing fees. In that case, a participation agreement outlines the indirect relationship between the Bank and the participant with regard to borrower access, loan servicing, loan documentation, and other matters. The participant's involvement is typically limited, and the participation interest is generally sold without recourse. We typically retain an ownership interest in the loan as well as the loan servicing rights in order to maintain our dire ct relationship with the borrower and better manage our credit risk. During the year en ded December 31, 2022, we sold 6.0 million in commercial business loans, 3.1 million in commercial construction loans, and 750,000 in commercial real estate loan participations, retaining both the servicing and a portion of the loan balances. During the year ended December 31, 2021 , we sold 43.5 million in multi-family real estate loans, retaining only the servicing, and 4.3 million in commercial construction loans, retaining both the servicing and a portion of the loan balances. 
 
 In 2021, we expanded our relationship with the SBA to include additional products. The SBA loans g enerally carry a government guarantee ranging from 75 -90 of the loan balance. The Bank sells the guaranteed portion and holds the remaining unguaranteed portion of the note. The Bank retains the servicing on these loans. We sold 5.7 million and 4.1 million of SBA participations during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of one- to four-family and commercial real estate loans are recognized at the time of the sale. Our net gain on sale of residential real estate, commercial real estate, and SBA loans was 824,000, 5.3 million, and 6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Loan Origination and Other Fees . Loan origination fees paid by borrowers generally are based on a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. Accounting standards require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized as income or expense at the time of prepayment or sale. We had 2.8 million, 4.8 million, and 4.3 million of net deferred loan fees at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Included in these totals at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was 13,000, 390,000, and 492,000, respectively, of PPP loan fees. In addition, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and miscellaneous services. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Management of asset quality includes loan performance monitoring and reporting as well as utilization of both internal and independent third-party loan reviews. The primary objective of our loan review process is to measure borrower performance and assess risk for the purpose of identifying loan weakness in order to minimize loan loss exposure. From the time of origination through final repayment, all loans are assigned a risk rating based on pre-determined criteria. The risk rating is monitored annually for most loans and may change during the life of the loan as appropriate. 
 
 Loan reviews vary by loan type and complexity. Some loans may warrant detailed individual review, while other loans may have less risk based upon size, or be of a homogeneous nature, such as consumer loans and loans secured by residential real estate. Homogeneous loans may be reviewed based on indicators such as delinquency or credit rating. In cases of significant concern, re-evaluation of the loan and associated risks are documented by completing a loan risk assessment and action plan.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the nonaccrual loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to 699,000, 679,000, and 686,000, respectively. The amount that was included in interest income on a cash basis on nonaccrual loans was 28,000, 48,000, and 85,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Other Loans of Concern. In addition to nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2022, there were 20 loans totaling 36.4 million that continue to accrue interest but for which management has concerns about the ability of these borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms. These loans are classified as special mention or substandard and have been considered in management's determination of our allowance for loan losses. 
 
 Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Property . Real property we acquire through collection and foreclosure efforts is classified as real estate owned. These properties are recorded at the lower of cost, which is the unpaid principal balance of the related loan, or the fair market value of the property less selling costs. Real estate owned properties are generally listed with a real estate broker, included in the multiple listing service, and actively marketed. Other repossessed property, including automobiles, is also recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value less selling costs. As of December 31, 2022, we had no repossessed real or personal property owned. 
 
 Restructured Loans. According to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as a TDR. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if we, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower under more favorable terms and conditions than we would grant to an ordinary bank customer under the normal course of business. 
 
 We engage in other general loan restructures and modifications not considered as TDR loans, which may include lowering interest rates, extending the maturity date, deferring or re-amortizing monthly payments or other concessions, provided that such concessions are not below market rates or considered material and outside of the terms and conditions granted to other borrowers in the ordinary course of business. These general loan restructures and modifications are made on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Adversely classified loans that are subsequently modified and placed in nonaccrual status are generally not returned to accrual status until a period of at least six months with consecutive satisfactory payment performance has occurred, and a return to accrual status is further supported by current financial information and analysis which demonstrates a particular borrower has the financial capacity to meet future debt service requirements. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had loans with an aggregate principal balance of 1.8 million that were identified as TDR loans, of which all but 29,000 were performing in accordance with their revised payment terms and on accrual status. Included in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022, was a reserve of 18,000 related to TDR loans. Nonaccrual TDR loans are classified as substandard while accruing TDR loans may be classified at any level in our loan grading system depending upon verified repayment sources, collateral values and repayment history.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard when material conditions are identified which raise issues about the financial capacity, collateral or other conditions which may compromise the borrower s ability to satisfactorily perform under the terms of the loan. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make near term collection or liquidation highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible or of no material value. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are classified by us as either watch or special mention assets. Our credit administration department, management, and the Board review the analysis and approve the specific loan loss allowance for these loans. 
 
 General reserve loan loss allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances on impaired loans, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an institution identifies a problem asset as an unavoidable and imminent loss, it is required to partially or fully charge-off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the DFI and the FDIC, who can order specific charge-offs or the establishment of additional loan loss allowances. 
 
 We review, at least quarterly, the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require reclassification. Based on our review, as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had classified loans of 16.9 million, 12.6 million, and 7.5 million, respectively. We had no other classified assets at these dates. In addition, we had 20.8 million, 12.3 million and 24.0 million of special mention loans at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses was 16.1 million, or 1.05 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, compared to 15.1 million, or 1.11 , at December 31, 2021. On a quarterly basis, management prepares a report of the allowance for loan losses and establishes the provision for credit losses based on its analysis of the risk composition of our loan portfolio, delinquency levels, loss experience, economic conditions, seasoning of the loan portfolios, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Quantitative analysis is necessary to calculate accounting estimates for loan loss reserves, and we also recognize that qualitative factors such as economic, market, industry and political changes can adversely affect loan quality. These qualitative factors are updated and approved by management on a quarterly basis. Each quarter, a report on the allowance for loan losses, including the application and discussion of quantitative and qualitative factors established during the quarter, is reviewed by the Board's loan committee and presented for approval to the full Board. The allowance is increased or decreased by the provision for or recapture of loan losses, which is charged or credited against current period operating results, and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, and improvements in asset quality. 
 
 Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The formula for the general loan loss reserve allowance is determined by applying an estimated quantified loss percentage, as well as qualitative factors, to various groups of loans. We use a three-year loss history including loss percentages based on various historical measures such as the amount and type of classified loans, past due ratios, loss experience, and economic conditions, which could affect the collectability of the respective loan types. Qualitative factors and adjustments to the loan loss reserve calculations are largely subjective but also include objective variables such as unemployment rates, falling or rising real estate values, real estate and retail sales, demographics and other known significant economic indicators. A general allowance is then established, based upon the analysis of the above conditions, to recognize the inherent risk associated with the entire loan portfolio. A specific allowance is established when management believes a borrower s financial and/or collateral condition has materially deteriorated to a point of impairment, and loss is highly probable for that specific loan. 
 
 We define a loan as being impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are grouped together for impairment analysis and reserve calculation. All other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors which include payment history, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance. As of December 31, 2022, we had impaired loans of 3.0 million, compared to 3.2 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 In determining specific reserves for those loans evaluated for impairment on an individual basis, management utilizes the valuation shown in the most recent appraisal of the collateral and may adjust that valuation as additional information becomes available. Generally, appraisals or evaluations are updated subsequent to the time of origination, whenever management identifies a loan as impaired or potentially being impaired. Events which may trigger an updated appraisal or evaluation include, but are not limited to, borrower delinquency, material technical defaults, annual review of borrower s financial condition, property tax and/or assessment delinquency, deferred maintenance or other information known or discovered by us.

Impaired collateral dependent loans require a current valuation and analysis to determine the net value of the collateral for loan loss reserve purposes. Our policy is to update these values every 12 months if the loan and collateral remains impaired, except for smaller balance, homogeneous loans, which are applied a reserve according to their risk weighting and loan class. Certain types of collateral, depending on market conditions, may require more frequent appraisals, updates or evaluations. When the results of the impairment analysis indicate a potential loss, the loan is classified as substandard and is analyzed to determine if a specific reserve amount is to be established or adjusted to reflect any further deterioration in the value of the collateral that may occur prior to liquidation or reinstatement. The impairment analysis takes into consideration the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources of repayment and whether impairment is likely to be temporary in nature or liquidation is anticipated. 
 
 Management believes that our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2022, is adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provision that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their evaluation of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Investment Activities 
 
 General . Under Washington law, commercial banks are permitted, subject to certain limitations, to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt, investment grade commercial and residential mortgage-related securities, and obligations of states and their political subdivisions. 
 
 Our Treasurer, under the direction of the CFO, has the responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio. Various factors are considered when making investment decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds from deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. 
 
 The general objective of our investment portfolio is to provide liquidity, generate earnings, and manage risk, including credit, reinvestment, liquidity and interest rate risk. 
 
 Securities. Total investment securities decreased 17.6 million, or 5.1 , to 326.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 344.2 million at December 31, 2021, mainly as a result of changes in market value, sales and principal payments partially offset by purchases. 
 
 The issuers of mortgage-backed agency securities ("MBS") held in our portfolio, which include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), and certain issuers of agency bonds held in our portfolio, which include FHLB and Fannie Mae, guarantee the timely principal and interest payments in the event of default. Municipal bonds consist of a mix of taxable and non-taxable revenue and general obligation bonds issued by various local and state government entities that use their revenue-generating and taxing authority as a source of repayment of their debt. Our municipal bonds are considered investment grade, and we monitor their credit quality on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Non-agency MBS securities have no guarantees in the event of default and therefore warrant continued monitoring for credit quality. Our non-agency MBS securities consist of fixed and variable rate mortgages issued by various corporations, which we believe have sufficient subordination to mitigate the risk of loss on these investments, and certain corporate debt securities. Monitoring of these securities may include, but is not limited to, reviewing credit quality standards such as delinquency, subordination, and credit ratings. Our rated non-agency and corporate debt securities are considered investment grade and non-rated securities are subject to regular internal review to ensure they meet the Company's investment criteria. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bank marked its held to maturity investments as available for sale in order to provide greater flexibility to manage changes in the investment portfolio. Management does not intend to place securities into a held-to-maturity portfolio in the foreseeable future. 
 
 As a member of the FHLB, we had an average balance of 8.5 million in stock of the FHLB for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. We received 502,000, 190,000, and 255,000 in dividends from the FHLB during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

The Company may hold certain investment securities in an unrealized loss position that are not considered other than temporarily impaired ("OTTI"). At December 31, 2022, of the 185 investment securities held, there were 182 investment securities with 48.6 million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately 323.8 million. At December 31, 2021, of the 164 investment securities held, there were 76 investment securities with 2.5 million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately 156.4 million. We had no OTTI on investment securities at either December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Management believes that the unrealized losses on investment securities relate principally to general changes in interest rates and market liquidity that have occurred since the initial purchase, and not to changes in credit quality. These unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate fluctuations in the future. Certain investments in a loss position are guaranteed by government entities or government sponsored entities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and believes it is not likely it will be required to sell these investments prior to a market price recovery or maturity. 
 
 Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
 
 General . Deposits, borrowings and loan and investment cash flows are the major sources of our funds for lending, investment, and general business purposes. Scheduled loan and investment repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and other market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB and subordinated debt are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk. 
 
 Our deposit composition consists of interest and noninterest-bearing checking, savings, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. We rely on marketing activities, digital channels, branch facilities, mail and contact center services, relationship management, word of mouth referrals, and a broad range of deposit products and payment services to attract and retain customer deposits. 
 
 Deposits . Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structure and deposit mix, our customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative sources.

The Federal Reserve requires First Fed to maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Negotiable order of withdrawal accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2022, our deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and vault cash exceeded our reserve requirements.

Borrowings. We use advances from the FHLB, including short-term overnight, short-term advances with initial maturities of less than one year, and longer-term advances maturing in one year or more, to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet ongoing liquidity needs, and to mitigate interest rate risk. As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain pledged assets including mortgage loans and investment securities. Advances are made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a committed credit facility with the FHLB, and at December 31, 2022, had pledged loan and security collateral to support a borrowing capacity of 533.4 million. In addition, we have a letter of credit established in conjunction with assuming the Bellevue branch lease liability. At December 31, 2022, outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled 234.0 million and the letter of credit balance was 772,000, leaving a remaining borrowing capacity of 298.6 million. 
 
 First Fed also established a borrowing arrangement to use the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco's ("FRB") discount window. At December 31, 2022, we had pledged securities as collateral to support a borrowing capacity of 8.6 million. No funds have been borrowed on this arrangement to date. 
 
 On March 25, 2021, the Company completed a private placement of 40.0 million of 3.75 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031 (the Notes to certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately 39.3 million after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Company for regulatory capital purposes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes and provided 20.0 million to the Bank as Tier 1 capital. 
 
 On May 20, 2022, First Northwest entered into a borrowing arrangement with NexBank for a 20.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings under the arrangement with NexBank are secured by a blanket lien on First Northwest's personal property assets (with certain exclusions), including all the outstanding shares of First Fed, cash, loans receivable, and limited partnership investments. The line of credit matures on May 19, 2023, with the option for two 364-day extensions.

Competition 
 
 We face competition in originating loans from other banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, mortgage bankers, public and private capital markets, and digital lenders. In general, the primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates and rate adjustment provisions, loan maturities, loan fees, and the quality of service. We offer competitive terms and conditions and compete by delivering high-quality, personal service to our customers. Competition for loans is also strong due to the number and variety of institutions competing in our market areas. For instance, competition for loans is particularly intense in the larger markets in the Puget Sound area, such as Seattle, Washington. 
 
 Competition for deposits is primarily from other banks, credit unions, mutual funds, and other alternative investment vehicles such as securities firms, insurance companies, etc., which may be offered locally or via the internet. We expect continued competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future, including competition from digital banking competitors, challenger banks, and "Fintech" companies that rely on technology to provide financial services. We compete for these deposits by offering excellent service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates and through our branch network. We also compete for deposits by offering a variety of financial services, including online and mobile banking capabilities. Based on the most recent branch data provided by the FDIC, as of June 30, 2022, First Fed s share of bank, savings bank and savings and loan association deposits in Clallam and Jefferson counties was 40.1 and 23.0 , respectively, and was less than 4 in Whatcom, Kitsap and King counties. 
 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 285 full-time equivalent employees. A t that date, the average tenure of all of our full-time employees was approximately 4.9 years while the average tenure of our executive officers was approximately 4.0 years . None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations to be excellent. 
 
 Our Board of Directors guides the implementation of our corporate mission, vision, and values as an important element of risk oversight because our people are integral to the success of our corporate strategy. Our Board holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining, and communicating our culture to employees. In that regard, our corporate mission, vision, and values are designed to promote commitment to making the lives of all those around us better and to uphold that principle in everything we do. That commitment has been a central pillar in our approach to our employees and the communities we have proudly served for nearly 100 years. Our culture is designed to adhere to the timeless values of optimism, respect, initiative, growth, and ownership. In keeping with that culture, we strive to be a force for good in everyday life and expect our employees to treat each other and our customers with the highest level of care and respect, going out of their way to do the right thing. We dedicate resources to promote a safe and inclusive workplace; attract, develop, and retain talented, diverse employees; promote a culture of integrity, caring, and excellence; and reward and recognize employees for both the results they deliver and, just as importantly, how they deliver them. We also seek to design fulfilling careers, with competitive compensation and benefits with a positive work-life balance. We dedicate resources to fostering professional and personal growth with continuing education, on-the-job training, and development programs. This devotion to our people has earned us recognition on Forbes magazine's Best-in-State Bank list in 2021. 
 
 Our employees are the cornerstone of our success as an organization. We are committed to attracting, retaining, and promoting highly qualified individuals from a diverse array of backgrounds. We believe employing a diverse workforce enhances our ability to serve our customers and our communities. We have established a voluntary, employee-led and -staffed Empathy and Inclusion team that is committed to promoting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment for all employees. We seek to better understand the financial needs of our prospective and current customers by promoting and fostering a workforce that reflects the communities we serve, along with providing relevant financial service products. As we move forward, we will continue to grow our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in a manner consistent with our company vision: to create well-being and prosperity for our employees, customers, and communities.

How We Are Regulated 
 
 First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed are subject to federal, state, and local laws that may change from time to time. This section provides a general overview of the federal and state regulatory framework applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed. The descriptions of laws and regulations included herein do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 
 
 These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, continue to be subject to change by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed (including their interpretation or implementation) cannot be predicted and could have a material effect on First Northwest Bancorp s and First Fed s business and operations. Numerous changes to the statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed have been made or proposed in recent years. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve or the CFPB could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. 
 
 Regulation of First Fed Bank 
 
 General . First Fed, as a state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the DFI. It also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of First Fed to the maximum extent permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may, among other things, require First Fed to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact our capital and earnings. This regulation of First Fed is intended for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting the shareholder(s) of First Fed or First Northwest Bancorp. First Fed is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to First Northwest Bancorp. See " Capital Requirements" and " Dividends." 
 
 Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions . As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered commercial banks, the DFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a cease-and-desist order against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance of such an institution if the FDIC determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations, or compliance status of a commercial bank. 
 
 Regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions . State laws and regulations govern First Fed's ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state-chartered commercial bank, First Fed must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the DFI. 
 
 Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington commercial banks as federally and other-state chartered banks and savings institutions with branches in Washington, subject to the approval of the DFI. Washington commercial banks are permitted to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the DFI may approve applications by Washington commercial banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity if the DFI determines that the activity is closely related to banking and First Fed is otherwise qualified under the statute. This additional authority, however, is subject to review and approval by the FDIC if the activity is not permissible for national banks.

Table of Contents 

Regulation of Management. Federal law (1) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the bank's federal supervisory agency; (2) as discussed below, places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and (3) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area. 
 
 Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and federal regulations place additional restrictions on loans to insiders and generally prohibit loans to senior officers other than for certain specified purposes. 
 
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC . The DIF of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in First Fed up to 250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 888,000. No institution may pay a dividend to its parent holding company if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. 
 
 The FDIC determines the amount of insurance premiums based on each financial institution's deposit base and the applicable assessment rate. The assessment rate for small institutions (those with less than 10 billion in assets) is based on an institution s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. Currently, assessment rates range from 3 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 6 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 16 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS composite scores of 4 or 5, subject to certain adjustments. 
 
 The FDIC has authority to increase assessment rates and in October 2022 adopted a Final Rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions, increasing assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. Increases to insurance assessments have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Fed. The FDIC communicated that the new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent. Progressively lower assessment rates can be expected when the reserve ratio reaches two percent. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC may also prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Action . Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework, designed to place restrictions on an insured depository institution if its capital levels begin to show signs of weakness, based on five capital categories: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." An institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital measures, a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework.

Table of Contents 

Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if it has a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0 or more (the total risk-based capital ratio); a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio) of 8.0 or more; a ratio of Tier 1 common equity capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5 or more (the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio); a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (the leverage ratio) of 5.0 or more; and the institution is not subject to a federal order, agreement, or directive to meet a specific capital level. An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or more; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 or more; and a leverage ratio of 4.0 or more. The classifications for "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized" institutions are also set forth in the regulations. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Further, an institution may be downgraded to a category lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 
 Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls, and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by First Fed to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if not remedied, result in restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, First Fed was categorized as "well capitalized" under the regulatory capital requirements described below. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require insured depository institutions and bank holding companies (including financial holding companies) to meet several minimum capital standards. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6 ; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4 . 
 
 In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, consisting of additional CET1 capital of more than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based ratios in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed each met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for "well capitalized" institutions. For additional information regarding First Northwest Bancorp s and First Fed s required and actual capital levels at December 31, 2022, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution s capital level is or may become inadequate considering particular risks or circumstances. Management believes that, under the current regulations, First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees, and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. First Fed has established comprehensive policies and risk management procedures to ensure the safety and soundness of First Fed. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Fed is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. As a member, First Fed is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, First Fed held 11.7 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region, and it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each FHLB makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by its Board of Directors, subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB, and all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At December 31, 2022, First Fed had 234.0 million of outstanding advances from the FHLB of Des Moines. See Item 1, "Business Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds Borrowings." 
 
 The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of First Fed's FHLB of Des Moines stock may result in a corresponding reduction in its capital. 
 
 Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions . Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership, the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2 of the bank s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10 of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.

Dividends . Dividends from First Fed, which are subject to regulation and limitation, constitute a major source of funds for dividends paid by First Northwest Bancorp to shareholders. As a general rule, regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and financial holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that an institution should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below the minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. According to Washington law, First Fed may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. Dividends on First Fed s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of First Fed without the approval of the Director of the DFI. 
 
 Affiliate Transactions . Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their financial holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act further extended the definition of an "affiliate" and treats credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, and borrowing transactions as covered transactions under the regulations. Transactions deemed to be a "covered transaction" under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10 of the bank subsidiary s capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20 of the bank subsidiary s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act . First Fed is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA"). Under the CRA, federal bank regulators assess a bank s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the communities serviced by the bank, including low-and moderate -income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency s assessment of a bank s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank s application, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits; to relocate an existing office; or to merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In some cases, a bank's failure to comply with the CRA, or CRA protests filed by interested parties during applicable comment periods, can result in the denial or delay of such transactions. First Fed received a "satisfactory" rating during its most recent CRA examination. In May 2022, federal bank regulators released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize CRA regulations and related regulatory framework. Future changes in the evaluation process or requirements under CRA could impact the Bank s rating. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Ratios. The federal banking regulators issued guidance reminding financial institutions to reexamine the existing regulations regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending, including acquisition, development and construction lending. The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The banking regulators are directed to examine each bank s exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. The guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be considered in evaluating capital adequacy and does not specifically limit a bank s commercial real estate lending to a specified concentration level. 
 
 Privacy Standards . The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. First Fed is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require First Fed to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.

Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including First Fed, that have made loans secured by properties with potentially hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs that often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 
 
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a commercial bank. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020, to support lending to households and businesses. As of December 31, 2022, First Fed was in compliance with the reserve requirements in place at that time. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") requires all financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA also sets forth various recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as reporting suspicious activities that might signal criminal activity) and certain due diligence and "know your customer" documentation requirements. 
 
 The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AMLA ), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. 
 
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act"), intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006. In relevant part, the Patriot Act (1) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; (2) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; (3) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money laundering compliance program; and (4) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. 
 
 Regulators are directed to consider a bank holding company s and a bank s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing and ruling on applications under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed have established comprehensive compliance programs designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA and Patriot Act.

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. First Fed is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, it is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. The CFPB has issued and continues to issue numerous regulations under which we may incur additional expense in connection with our ongoing compliance obligations. Significant recent CFPB developments that may affect operations and compliance costs include: 

Positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, most recently expanding its supervisory approach to prevent discrimination by using the unfairness standard under the unfair, deceptive, or abuse acts or practices framework in the Dodd-Frank Act in addition to the historical reliance on regulatory requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA and the Fair Housing Act FHA ); 

The CFPB's Final Rule amending Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring most lenders to report expanded information in order for the CFPB to more effectively monitor fair lending concerns and other information shortcomings identified by the CFPB; 

Positions taken by the CFPB regarding the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Federal Reserve Regulation E, which require companies to obtain consumer authorizations before automatically debiting a consumer s account for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers; 

Efforts focused on enforcing certain compliance obligations the CFPB deems a priority, such as automobile and student loan servicing (including certain forbearance requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic), debt collection, collateral repossession, mortgage origination and servicing, remittances, and fair lending, among others; and 

Positions and focused efforts on enforcing compliance obligations related to deposit account fees, including overdraft, non-sufficient funds, and returned deposit fees. 

First Fed is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, some of these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the way financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. In recent years, examination and enforcement by federal and state banking agencies for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations have increased and become more intense. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject First Fed to various penalties including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. First Fed has established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure consumer protection. 
 
 Regulation and Supervision of First Northwest Bancorp 
 
 General. First Northwest Bancorp is a financial holding company (a type of bank holding company) registered with the Federal Reserve and the sole shareholder of First Fed. Bank holding companies and financial holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that First Northwest Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of First Fed. During 2022, First Northwest elected to be treated as a financial holding company, allowing the Company to engage in non-banking activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. 
 
 As a bank holding company, First Northwest Bancorp is required to file semi-annual and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and/or for unsafe or unsound practices. 
 
 The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, First Northwest Bancorp is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by being prepared to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity (including at times when a bank holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in the bank holding company s or its shareholders' best interests to do so), and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiaries. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations, or both.

Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company, or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks, and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 
 
 Acquisitions. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designated as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities, and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital rules pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications under the BHCA. These rules apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with 3.0 billion or more in assets, or with fewer assets but certain risky activities, and on a bank-only basis to other companies. When applicable, the bank holding company capital adequacy and conservation buffer rules are the same as those imposed by the FDIC. For additional information, see the section above entitled "- Regulation of First Fed Bank - Capital Regulation" and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Interstate Banking . The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Interstate Act") and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by state and federally chartered banks. The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the bank holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. 
 
 The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period of five years, or longer if specified by the law of the host state. In addition, the Federal Reserve generally may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the applicant controls or would control more than 10 of the insured deposits in the United States or 30 or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30 state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law. Banks may establish de novo branches in any state, subject to regulatory approval. 
 
 The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997, which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. Federal bank regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production, and federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.

Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic transactions are "reasonable and proportional" to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Notably, the Federal Reserve's rules set a maximum permissible interchange fee, among other requirements. As of December 31, 2022, First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed qualified for the small issuer exemption from the Federal Reserve s interchange fee cap, which applies to any debit card issuer that has total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion as of the end of the previous calendar year. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends . First Northwest Bancorp's ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the Federal Reserve limits and Washington law, and it may depend on its ability to receive dividends from First Fed, as discussed above. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. In particular, the policy limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company's net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company not subject to consolidated capital requirements is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1, and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. The capital conservation buffer requirements may limit First Northwest Bancorp's ability to pay dividends. 
 
 Except for a company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10.0 or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement. 
 
 Under Washington corporate law, First Northwest Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities . These various laws and regulatory policies may affect First Northwest Bancorp s ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 Tying Arrangements. First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property, or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither First Northwest Bancorp nor First Fed may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either (1) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by First Northwest Bancorp or First Fed; or (2) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010 and imposes restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and required new capital regulations that are discussed above under "- Regulation of First Fed - Capital Regulations." In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like First Northwest Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two, or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; and (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer.

In August 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. The rule is intended to provide shareholders with information that they can use to evaluate a Chief Executive Officer s compensation. 
 
 Federal Securities Law. The stock of First Northwest Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As a result, First Northwest Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 
 First Northwest Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of First Northwest Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If First Northwest Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of First Northwest Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 
 
 The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to First Northwest Bancorp as a registered company under the Exchange Act. The stated goals of these Sarbanes-Oxley requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley-related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. 
 
 Recent and Proposed Legislation. The economic and political environment of the past several years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental, and regulatory initiatives that may significantly impact the banking industry. Other regulatory initiatives by federal and state agencies may also significantly impact First Northwest Bancorp's and First Fed s business. First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on its operations, competitive situation, financial conditions, or results of operations. Recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations typically result in a greater compliance burden (and therefore increase the general costs of doing business), and the current administration under President Biden has indicated a general intent to regulate the financial services industry more strictly than the administration of his predecessor. 
 
 Effects of Federal Government Monetary Policy. First Northwest Bancorp s earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Through its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings, establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, and control of the interest rate applicable to excess reserve balances and reverse repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve influences the availability and cost of money and credit and, ultimately, a range of economic variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services. Recently, the Federal Reserve shifted its focus from economic growth to addressing continued concerns with inflation. During 2022, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate seven times, an increase of 425 basis points for the year, and communicated that it anticipates ongoing increases. Changes in monetary policy, including increases in the federal funds rate, can affect net interest income and margin, overall profitability, and shareholders' equity. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 
 Cybersecurity . In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. 

53

Table of Contents 

The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If First Fed fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 
 In November 2021, the federal banking agencies adopted a Final Rule, with compliance required by May 1, 2022, establishing new notification requirements for banking organizations. The new rule requires banks to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a computer-security incident rising to the level of a "notification incident" has occurred. A "notification incident" is one that materially affects or is reasonably likely to affect, the viability of the banking operations and resulting in material loss or potential impact to the stability of the United States. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states, including Washington, have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located. 
 
 Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Cybersecurity concerns are further heightened by Russia's current invasion of Ukraine. 
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance . Bank regulatory agencies and the SEC have shown increasing interest in environmental, social and internal governance matters (often referred to as ESG and have stated their intent to heighten regulatory oversight of companies efforts to address the effect of ESG issues on their businesses. First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed are committed to considering ESG factors, which we recognize are key drivers of long-term business growth, in the development of our business strategies. We believe our commitment to good corporate citizenship and the achievement of ESG policy goals enhances our ability to pursue business opportunities, manage risk across our business, and uphold our values by addressing the environmental and social challenges faced by the communities we serve. Our Board oversees our ESG activities, including our ESG strategies, compliance, and goals. Additionally, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees our policies and operational controls for environmental, health, safety and social risks. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets regularly to set ESG goals for the Company, as well as to monitor progress and results.

Taxation 
 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General . First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to First Northwest Bancorp or First Fed. First Fed is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before December 31, 2018. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 First Northwest Bancorp will file a consolidated federal income tax return with First Fed. Accordingly, any cash distributions made by First Northwest Bancorp to its shareholders would be considered taxable dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. 
 
 Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, First Fed currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. Federal income tax returns are filed using a December 31 year end. 
 
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . First Northwest Bancorp may eliminate from its income dividends received from First Fed as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Northwest Bancorp if it elects to file a consolidated return with First Fed. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100 , or 65 , in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend. Corporations that own less than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 50 of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 
 
 Washington Taxation 
 
 The Company and First Fed are subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.75 of gross receipts. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Economy and Our Markets 
 
 Adverse economic conditions in market areas we serve could adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. 
 
 A significant portion of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the state of Washington. An economic decline affecting our region could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Weakness in the global economy has adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent on international trade. Deterioration in the national economy as a result of continued inflation, the rising interest rate environment, and recurring supply chain issues may also have an adverse effect on the region. 
 
 Any future deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve, in particular the North Olympic Peninsula and Puget Sound area of Washington State, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations: 

loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 

demand for our products and services may decline, possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans or assets; 

loan collateral may decline in value, exposing us to increased risk of loss on existing loans and reducing customers borrowing power; 

the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and 

the amount of our deposits may decrease and the composition of our deposits may be adversely affected. 

A decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in the regional and general economy could reduce our growth rate, impair our ability to collect loans, and generally have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Public health crises , geopolitical developments, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, climate change and other external factors could harm our business. 
 
 Public health crises, domestic or geopolitical crises, such as the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia, political instability or civil unrest, terrorism, human error or other events outside of our control, could cause disruptions to our business or the United States' economy, resulting in potentially adverse operating results. Natural disasters may disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate. Climate change may worsen the severity and impact of future natural disasters and other extreme weather-related events that could cause disruption to our business and operations. Chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also cause disruption to the business and operations of our customers, with potentially negative effects on our loan portfolio and growth opportunities. A significant natural disaster, such as a tsunami, earthquake, fire or flood, where we or our customers live and do business, could have a material adverse impact on our local market areas and our ability to conduct business, especially if our insurance coverage is insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. The effects of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.

Conditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs, which could adversely affect our earnings and capital levels. 
 
 Liquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a variety of sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. We require enough liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding may negatively affect our liquidity, asset growth and, consequently, our earnings capability and capital levels. In addition to any deposit growth, and the sale of loans or investment securities, maturity of investment securities and loan payments, we rely from time to time on advances from the FHLB and certain other wholesale funding sources to meet liquidity demands. Our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we were unable to access funds from the FHLB or other wholesale funding sources. 
 
 Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include actions by the FRB, a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as consumer and business behavior utilizing funds on deposit to pay down higher cost debt or to seek higher yielding investments, a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Additionally, collateralized public funds are bank deposits of state and local municipalities. These deposits are required to be secured by certain investment grade securities or other collateral to ensure repayment, which on the one hand tends to reduce our contingent liquidity risk by making these funds somewhat less credit sensitive, but on the other hand reduces standby liquidity by restricting the potential liquidity of the pledged collateral. Although these funds historically have been a relatively stable source of funds for us, availability depends on the individual municipality's fiscal policies and cash flow needs. 
 
 The continued economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our financial results and those of our customers. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions caused significant economic turmoil in the U.S. and around the world, resulting in a slow-down in economic activity, increased unemployment levels and disruptions in global supply chains and financial markets. The long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are difficult to predict due to the ongoing dynamic nature of COVID-19 variants, the possibility of a similar health crisis and potential for additional government action. Management is confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the pandemic on credit quality, revenues and asset values. 

57

Table of Contents 

Although the Company estimates loan losses related to the pandemic as part of its evaluation of the allowance for loan losses, such estimates involve significant judgment and are made in the context of substantial uncertainty as to the long-term impact of the pandemic on the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Consistent with guidance provided by banking regulators, we modified loans by providing various loan payment deferral options to our borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding these modifications, not every borrower may be able to recover and make full payments on their loans. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Although the U.S. and global economies have started recovering as governments lift or reduce health-related restrictions and as demand for goods and services increases, some adverse consequences including labor shortages, disruptions of global supply chains, and increasing inflation, continue to negatively impact the international, national, and local economies. As a result, our business may be materially and adversely affected. To the extent the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section. 
 
 Credit and Asset Quality 
 
 Our increased emphasis on commercial real estate lending subjects us to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We have increased the amount of our commercial real estate and multi-family loans to 643.8 million, or 42.0 of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2022, from 535.7 million, or 39.5 , of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. We intend to continue to increase, subject to market demand, our origination and purchase of commercial real estate loans. As an institution s concentration in commercial real estate lending increases, it becomes subject to more scrutiny under the FDIC's policies for management of its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 
 
 Our increased focus on this type of lending has increased our risk profile. Commercial real estate loans are intended to enhance the average yield of our earning assets; however, they do involve a different level of risk compared to one- to four-family loans. The repayment of commercial real estate loans typically depends on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers operating business, or their ability to lease the commercial property at sufficient rates. The value of the commercial real estate securing the loan as collateral is a secondary source of repayment in case of default, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Recently, federal banking regulators highlighted the increased risk associated with commercial real estate loans as a result of the stress COVID-19 created for some industries, and the higher vulnerability of these credits to pressure from the current rising interest rate environment and overall inflationary pressures in the economy. These loans also involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development on a single one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.

Table of Contents 

Since commercial real estate loans generally have large balances, deterioration in the quality of commercial loans may result in the need to significantly increase our provision for loan losses and charge-offs will likely be larger on a per loan basis compared to consumer loans. As a result, deterioration of this portfolio could have a materially adverse effect on our future earnings. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis for commercial loans also requires a more detailed review at origination and on an ongoing basis. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral is typically longer than for a one- to four-family residence because the market for most types of commercial real estate is not readily liquid, resulting in less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these assets. At December 31, 2022, we had 51,000 of nonperforming commercial real estate loans and 0 of nonperforming multi-family loans in our portfolio. 
 The significant growth in our loan portfolio and expansion into new markets may increase our credit risk. 
 
 Since the completion of our initial public offering in January 2015, we have grown substantially in terms of total assets, total loans, total deposits, employees, and locations, expanding our business activities throughout the Puget Sound region. Our commercial loan portfolio, which includes loans for commercial and multi-family real estate as well as other business loans, has increased to 720.8 million, or 47.0 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, from 615.6 million, or 45.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. One- to four-family loans have increased to 343.8 million, or 22.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, from 295.0 million, or 21.7 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Total consumer loans have increased to 275.1 million, or 17.9 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, from 221.9 million, or 16.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Rapidly growing loan portfolios are, by their nature, less seasoned and our experience with these loans may not provide us with a significant payment history pattern. Rapid growth combined with the geographic expansion of our lending area may make estimating loan loss allowances more difficult and more susceptible to changes in estimates, and to losses exceeding estimates, than our more seasoned portfolio of loans in our traditional lending area. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of these parts of our loan portfolio. These loans may develop delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. 
 
 We plan to continue both strategic and opportunistic growth, understanding that we may see a slowing of growth as we mature and manage capital down to more efficient levels. Continued growth can present substantial demands on management personnel, line employees, and other aspects of our operations, especially if our growth occurs rapidly. We may face difficulties in managing that growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Also see "Our expansion strategy will cause our expenses to increase and may negatively affect our earnings." 
 
 We have a concentration of large loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers that increases our risk of loss. 
 
 First Fed has extended significant amounts of credit to certain borrowers, largely in connection with high-end residential real estate and commercial and multi-family real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of loans, including unused commitments, to First Fed's five largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately 79.4 million. Outstanding loan balances for the ten largest borrowing relationships at December 31, 2022, totaled 151.9 million, or 9.9 of total loans. Although none of the loans to First Fed's 20 largest borrowers were nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2022, concentration of credit to a limited number of borrowers increases the risk in First Fed's loan portfolio. If one or more of these borrowers is not able to service the contractual repayment, the potential loss to First Fed is more likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our construction and land loans are based upon estimates of costs and the value of the completed project. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, our construction and land loans decreased 30.1 million, or 13.4 , to 194.7 million, or 12.7 , of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and consisted of properties secured by one- to four-family residential of 58.7 million, multi-family of 77.0 million, commercial acquisition-renovation of 19.3 million, commercial real estate of 27.7 million, and land of 11.8 million. Land loans include raw land and land acquisition and development loans. 

59

Table of Contents 

Construction and land development lending generally involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project, the effects of governmental regulation on real property, and changes in demand, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio, which may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. 
 
 A downturn in housing, or the real estate market, could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Some of our builders have more than one loan outstanding with us, and an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss. 
 
 In addition, during the term of most of our construction loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. As a result, these loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the successful outcome of the project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold, which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, which may or may not enable us to fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. 
 
 Our business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential real estate. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 396.2 million, or 25.8 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family mortgage loans and home equity loans secured by residential properties. Lending on residential property is sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in residential real estate values securing these types of loans may increase the level of borrower defaults and losses above the recent charge-off experience on these loans. Jumbo one- to four-family residential loans that do not conform to secondary market mortgage requirements for our market areas would not be immediately saleable to Freddie Mac or other investors and may expose us to increased risk because of their larger balances. Further, a significant amount of our home equity lines of credit consist of loans in a subordinate lien position to a first lienholder. 
 
 For home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan balances in the event of default unless we repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on loans secured by junior liens.

Repayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 77.0 million, or 5.0 of total loans, in commercial business loans. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral-based lending with loan amounts based on the value of the collateral and predetermined loan to collateral ratios; liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Our commercial business loans are primarily supported by the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily by the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrowers' cash flows may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment. Factors affecting the value of this type of collateral include uncollectable accounts receivable and obsolete or limited use inventory, among others. 
 
 Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. 
 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we review our loan portfolios, loss and delinquency trends, and economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover incurred losses, resulting in additions to our allowance for loan losses through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. 
 
 Additionally, pursuant to our growth strategy, management recognizes that significant new loan growth, new loan products, new market areas, and the refinancing of existing loans, resulting in portfolios composed of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner, may increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. Significant provisions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. 
 
 In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Any additional provisions will result in a decrease in net income, and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") adopted Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-13 which became effective on January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL"), will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. In March 2022, FASB amended ASU 2016-13 related to CECL implementation and guidance on Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDRs") and vintage disclosures. These updates will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. For more information on this ASU, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 If our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets, were 1.8 million, or 0.1 of total assets. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways.

Table of Contents 

If additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates. 
 
 Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, ratings agency actions, defaults or other adverse events affecting the issuer or the underlying collateral, if any, of the security, changes in market interest rates, and continued instability in the capital markets. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current invasion by Russia of Ukraine, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. These factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary-impairment ("OTTI"), realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining OTTI requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the security's issuer and underlying collateral, if any, to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments due, and these estimates may differ significantly from actual future performance of the security. 
 
 If our real estate owned is not properly valued or declines further in value, our earnings could be reduced. 
 
 We obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and tax assessed values when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned and at certain other times during the asset s holding period. Our net book value of the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset s net book value over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, or if property values decline, the fair value of our real estate owned may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our real estate owned and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Significant charge-offs to our real estate owned could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. 
 
 We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. These competitors primarily include national, regional and digital banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, mortgage banking finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Competitors in these nonbank sectors may have fewer regulatory constraints, as well as lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. 
 
 Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of networks and technology systems. 
 
 Our security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage. 
 
 We support the ability of our customers to transact business through multiple automated methods. As such, we may be susceptible to fraud performed through these technologies. 
 
 Security breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in significant legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny or fines, violations of consumer protection and privacy laws, and significant damage to our reputation and our business. 
 
 Our security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer and consumer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 
 The occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we would be able to negotiate terms that are as favorable to us or obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Interest Rates, Operations and Risk Management 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk. 
 
 Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. While the federal funds target rate remained at or near historical lows during 2020 and 2021 as part of the fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate seven times in 2022 for a total annual increase of 425 basis points. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has communicated that it anticipates ongoing increases until inflationary pressures subside. When the Federal Reserve Board increases the Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact housing markets by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases. A rising interest rate environment may also adversely affect the U.S. economy and, as a result, our business as a whole. 
 
 Further changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate and/or sell mortgage and SBA loans (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, which could negatively impact shareholders' equity, and our ability to realize gains from sales of such assets; (iii) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; (iv) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; and (v) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. 
 
 Additional changes in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations or by reducing our margins and profitability. Our net interest margin is the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Further changes in interest rates-up or down-could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yields on interest-earning assets catch up. Changes in the slope of the "yield curve", or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates, could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, as at the end of 2022, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. 
 
 A sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. As a result of the exceptionally low interest rate environment for the past few years, an increasing percentage of our deposits have been composed of deposits bearing no or a relatively low rate of interest and having a shorter duration than our assets. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in this rising interest rate environment. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, would be adversely affected. 
 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, including our securities portfolio. Generally, the fair value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity.

Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely will not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet. See Item 7. "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk," of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Changes in the method of determining the LIBOR or other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans receivable and other financial instruments we hold that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the potential replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") at the end of 2021. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a "benchmark" or "reference rate" for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC ), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate TSOFR and has crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. Our subordinated debt issued in March 2021 provides for application the TSOFR rate to determine the interest that will be payable on the Notes beginning in March 2026. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act was enacted, providing that LIBOR-based contracts that lack practicable replacement benchmarks will automatically transition to the applicable reference rates recommended by the Federal Reserve. In December 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a Final Rule establishing benchmark replacements based on TSOFR. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, expects to continue publishing some LIBOR tenors until June 2023 and may be compelled to continue publishing other tenors under a different methodology after the Financial Conduct Authority FCA completes a consultation and makes a final determination on the matter (expected in 2023). 
 
 Despite the progress made through the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve's Final Rule, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities, variable rate loans, and other securities or financial arrangements. The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies. It is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, the replacement of LIBOR will impact the value of any loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit we hold or that are due to us, that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or whether, or to what extent, such changes may impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Decreased volumes and lower gains on sales of loans could adversely impact our noninterest income. 
 
 We originate and sell one- to four-family mortgage loans. Our mortgage banking income is a significant portion of our noninterest income. We generate gains on the sale of one- to four-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Freddie Mac and other secondary market investors. Any future changes in their purchase programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Further, in a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations. In addition, although we sell loans into the secondary market without recourse, we are required to give customary representations and warranties about the loans to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers may require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.

A portion of our loan portfolio is serviced by third parties, which may limit our ability to foreclose on or repossess such loans. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , 83.4 million of our consumer, 25.3 million of our one- to four-family, and 18.1 million of our comm ercial real estate loan portfolios were serviced by third parties. When a loan goes into default, it is the responsibility of the third-party servicer to enforce the borrower s obligation to repay the outstanding indebtedness. We are reliant on the servicer to bring the loan current, enter into a satisfactory loan modification or foreclose on the property on behalf of First Fed. We must comply with any loan modification entered into by the servicer even if we would not otherwise agree to the modified terms, which may result in a reduction in our interest income due to the loan modification. Delays in foreclosing on property, whether caused by restrictions under state or federal law or the failure of a third-party servicer to timely pursue foreclosure action, may increase our potential loss on such property, due to factors such as lack of maintenance, unpaid property taxes and adverse changes in market conditions. These delays may adversely affect our ability to limit our credit losses. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 
 Our lending limit may restrict our growth. 
 
 Washington law provides that Washington chartered commercial banks are subject to loans-to-one-borrower restrictions, which generally restrict total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to 20 of its unimpaired capital and surplus. As a result, under Washington law, First Fed would be limited to loans to one borrower of 46.3 million at December 31, 2022. Under its current policy, First Fed has elected to restrict its loans to one borrower to no more than 60 of the Bank's lending limit, which is adjusted quarterly and was 34.7 million at December 31, 2022, unless specifically approved by the Senior Loan Committee as an exception to policy. This amount is significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential commercial borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our loans to one borrower lending limit from doing business with us. Our loans to one borrower restriction also impacts the efficiency of our commercial lending operation because it lowers our average loan size, which means we have to generate a higher number of transactions to achieve the same portfolio volume. We can accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial partners, but this strategy is not the most efficient or always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain clients seeking larger loans or may not be able to sell participations in these loans on terms we consider favorable. 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. 

We are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC as insurer of our deposits, and by the DFI. First Northwest Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve (as a financial holding company) and regulation by the State of Washington (as a Washington corporation). The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC and the DFI. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution s operations, require additional capital, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any future changes to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us could make compliance more difficult and expensive, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.

We are also subject to tax, accounting, securities, insurance, monetary laws and regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations that control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business. These may change significantly over time, which could materially impact our business and have a significant adverse effect on our cost of regulatory compliance and results of operations. Further, changes in accounting standards and their interpretation may materially impact how we report, potentially retroactively, our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies are expected to occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing, and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. If changes to laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us are made, such changes could offset the otherwise anticipated increase in operating and compliance costs (included in noninterest expense); however, no assurance can be given as to whether such changes will occur or what may result from such changes.

The CFPB, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has issued, and continues to issue, rules related to consumer protection, including The Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure (TRID), which combines certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing a mortgage loan. These CFPB rules, including rules generally prohibiting creditors from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability to repay, may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we underwrite and subject us to increased potential liabilities related to such residential loan origination activities. The CFPB has adopted a number of additional requirements and issued additional guidance, including with respect to indirect auto lending, appraisals, escrow accounts and servicing, each of which may entail increased compliance costs.

General Risk Factors 

We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons may materially and adversely affect our prospects. 

We rely heavily on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, and certain other key management personnel, which make up our management team. The loss of the services of any of our current management team could have a material adverse impact on our operations. The ability to attract, retain and season replacements to our management team presents risks to executing our business plan. Changes in our current management team and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we believe that our relationship with our management team is good, we cannot guarantee that all members of our management team will remain with our organization. 
 
 Our consideration of whole bank, branch acquisitions, or fintech partnerships in the future may expose us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us. 
 
 We may evaluate supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions or their businesses that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following: 

We may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the financial institutions, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected; 

The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful; and 

To finance a future acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.

Our expansion strategy will cause our expenses to increase and may negatively affect our earnings. 
 
 Over the past seven years, we have opened four new full-service branches and two business centers. We also acquired a branch from another financial institution in 2021. We may continue to open or purchase new branches and lending centers, and the success of our expansion strategy into new markets is contingent upon numerous factors, such as our ability to select suitable locations, assess each market's competitive environment, secure managerial resources, hire and retain qualified personnel and implement effective marketing strategies. The opening of new offices may not increase the volume of our loans and deposits as quickly or to the degree that we projected and opening new offices will increase our operating expenses. The cost of opening additional de novo branches and lending centers is uncertain, and projected timelines and estimated dollar amounts involved in opening new offices could differ significantly from actual results. In addition, we may not successfully manage the costs and implementation risks associated with our branching strategy. Accordingly, any new branch or lending center may negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the office reaches certain economies of scale, and there is a risk that our new offices will not be successful even after they have been established. 
 
 We may also expand our digital footprint through partnerships with and investments in fintech companies. The new technology and start-up companies we invest in may not be as successful as anticipated or may fail, resulting a total loss of our related investment.

 First Northwest is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and is engaged in banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, First Fed Bank, as well as certain non-banking financial activities, including a controlling interest in Quin Ventures, Inc. and several limited partnership investments. The Company's business activities are generally focused on passive investment activities and oversight of the activities of First Fed and Quin Ventures. The Company has also entered into partnerships to strategically invest in fintech-related businesses, which may result in the development of additional investment opportunities. 
 
 First Fed is a community-oriented financial institution serving Clallam, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, and Whatcom counties in Washington State, through its twelve full-service branches and four business centers. We offer a wide range of products and services focused on the lending, deposit and money movement needs of the communities we serve. While we have a concentration of first lien one- to four-family mortgage loans, in order to diversify our portfolio and increase interest income, we have increased our origination of commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, construction, and commercial business loans, and have increased our auto and consumer loans through originations, indirect auto lending, and purchased auto loan programs. We continue to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and regularly sell conforming loans into the secondary market to increase noninterest income and manage interest rate risk or retain select loans in our portfolio to enhance interest income. We offer traditional consumer and business deposit products, including transaction accounts, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit for individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. Deposits are our primary source of funding for our lending and investing activities. 
 
 First Fed is impacted by prevailing economic conditions as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, including fiscal stimulus, interest rate policy and open market operations, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by various factors, including sales and marketing efforts, interest rates paid on competing deposits, available alternative investments such as the stock and bond markets, account maturities, government stimulus and unemployment programs, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by prevailing interest rates and property values in our markets, the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders employed by First Fed, and regional economic cycles. 
 
 Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on our loans and investments and interest expense paid on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates can affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, debit card interchange income, mortgage banking income, treasury and other commercial banking related fees, earnings from bank-owned life insurance, loan servicing income, and gains and losses from sales of loans and securities. 
 
 An offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, which represents the periodic charge to operations required to adequately provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio through our allowance for loan losses. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income. 
 
 The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefit costs, occupancy and equipment expenses, federal deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments, digital delivery and data processing expenses, advertising and promotion expenses, expenses related to real estate and personal property owned, state and local taxes, federal income tax, and other miscellaneous expenses.

Our Business and Operating Strategy 
 
 Our operating strategy is focused on diversifying our loan portfolio, expanding our deposit product offerings, and enhancing our infrastructure. Certain highlights of our operations in the last three years include: 

Expanding our market presence. We hired several experienced and talented bankers with connections throughout Western Washington. In 2021, we opened a full-service branch in Ferndale, Washington and purchased a branch in Bellevue, Washington. Through these new locations, we have realized growth in deposits and expanded our ability to secure customer relationships and lending opportunities outside of our market areas in the North Olympic Peninsula; Kitsap Peninsula; and Bellingham, Washington. We also utilize technology to expand our market presence and to service new and existing businesses and consumers in Western Washington and beyond. 

Investing in financial technology ("fintech") companies. We have a ten-year commitment to invest in Canapi Ventures, which provides funding to fintech start-ups. The Canapi Ventures relationship allows us early access to companies producing technology and apps that may be of interest as we grow in the fintech sector. We also have ten-year commitments to invest in BankTech Ventures and JAM FINTOP, two fintech-focused venture capital funds designed for community banks. 

Enhancing the loan portfolio . We have significantly increased the origination of commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, and construction and land loans, as well as our portfolio of commercial business loans. This helped to increase overall net interest income. 

Adding new servicing capabilities . In addition to traditional consumer and business deposit products, we offer remote deposit capture, consumer and small business digital banking, and commercial digital banking capabilities. We implemented interactive teller machines, allowing our customers to conduct business with a teller through an interactive screen, at several locations. 

Enhancing our infrastructure . We have focused on upgrading our infrastructure, in terms of technology, equipment and personnel, in order to support our changing lending and deposit capabilities and position ourselves for growth. 

Our objective is to be an independent, high performing bank focused on meeting the needs of individuals, small businesses and community organizations throughout our market areas with exceptional service and competitive products. We intend to implement these strategies to achieve our objectives: 

Increasing our portfolio of higher yielding commercial loans. Through increased loan originations, we intend to increase the percentage of our loan portfolio consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate and commercial business loans. These loan categories offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations than traditional fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential loans. Our commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial business loans have increased to 720.8 million, or 47.0 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, from 615.6 million, or 45.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. The increase resulted in part from adding talented leaders to the commercial team; developing relationships with loan referral sources, including our Board of Directors and loan brokers; pursuing loan purchase and participation opportunities; and competing successfully in new and existing markets. 

Increasing noninterest income. We offer SBA loan products, which provide the opportunity to sell the guaranteed portion of loans originated, adding to our gain on sale of loans while also generating servicing fee income. We will continue our participation in the ARC swap program to generate additional fee income. We will maintain our focus on mortgage loan sales to increase income from both sale and servicing fees. We may also sell loans in order to manage concentrations and risk, which would generate gain and possibly additional servicing income. We anticipate that future revenue will be generated through treasury management products, merchant services, fintech partnerships and banking-as-a-service, which would add income and increased interchange fee income.

Maintaining our focus on asset quality. Maintaining strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. We are focused on monitoring existing performing loans, resolving nonperforming loans, and selling foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were 1.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 1.4 million at December 31, 2021. We have taken proactive steps to resolve our nonperforming loans, including negotiating repayment plans, forbearances, loan modifications and loan extensions with our borrowers when appropriate. We also retain the services of independent firms to periodically review segments of our loan portfolio and provide feedback regarding our loan policies and procedures. 

Attracting core deposits and other deposit products. We emphasize relationship banking with our customers to obtain a greater share of their deposits, with specific emphasis on primary transaction accounts. We believe this emphasis will help to increase our level of core deposits. In addition to our retail branches, we offer digital delivery solutions, such as personal financial management, business online banking, business remote deposit products, mobile remote deposit services through smartphones and tablets, consumer credit score access, account-to-account transfer services between First Fed and other banks, and person-to-person funds transfer, enabling us to compete effectively with banks of all sizes. We enhanced our mobile banking platform, upgraded our business on-line banking platform, and extended banking hours through our interactive teller machines and secure chat solutions. 

Expanding our market presence and capturing business opportunities resulting from changes in the competitive environment. By delivering high quality, customer-focused products and services, we believe we can attract additional borrowers and depositors and thus increase our market share and revenue generation in our market areas. We intend to continue our franchise growth. We expect that community bank consolidation will continue to take place and may consider acquiring additional individual branches or other banks. Our primary focus for expansion will be in Western Washington; however, we offer digital delivery in other markets. 

Hiring experienced employees with a customer sales and service focus. Our goal is to compete by relying on the strength of our customer service and relationship building. We believe that our ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals who have significant knowledge of existing and new market areas, possess strong commercial banking sales and service skills, and maintain a focus on community relationships will enhance our success. We intend to hire additional retail bankers, lenders and treasury management officers who are established in their communities to enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities. 

Improving our digital presence and streamlining the customer experience. By investing in and improving on the interfaces that connect customers to our products and services, we believe we will be in a better position to compete and grow in an environment that is becoming increasingly technology driven. We intend to invest in our online presence and engage in digital strategies that will help us to successfully compete in an ever-changing digital marketplace. In 2019, the Company committed to fund 3 million in Canapi Ventures to identify and infuse capital into certain promising fintech companies. This commitment includes management participation in meetings and events that inform us when making decisions regarding banking-as-a-service, digital services offerings and customer engagement. We introduced a new online mortgage application with a leading fintech partner in 2020 and launched new digital deposit application and consumer loan origination platforms in 2021. In 2022, the Company implemented a customer relationship management software to improve business and consumer relationships. 

Exploring alternative lending opportunities to improve interest income . We strive to grow the balance sheet and leverage capital in a safe and sound manner and believe that lending opportunities outside of organic originations may be a valuable source of interest income. We have increased our auto loan portfolio as a result of our partnership involving the purchase of loans made to borrowers purchasing high-end automobiles and classic cars. We also engaged with Triad Financial Services in 2020 to purchase manufactured home loans in pools and on a flow basis. We also purchase loans from Banker's Healthcare Group. We will continue to explore other opportunities such as these as a means to improve net income and supplement organic loan originations.

Expanding into digital and fintech markets. Banking-as-a-service offers significant growth opportunities. The fintech and digital banking markets offer innovation and expansion that First Fed can support through servicing products offered. We announced our partnership with Splash in January 2022 to collaborate on developing and deploying consumer loan products and solutions throughout the country. We continue to explore additional opportunities to partner with fintech and digital banking partners in order to expand this part of our digital strategy. 

Creating operating leverage . We will continue to look for ways to improve operational efficiency. We realigned positions in 2022 to better meet organizational objectives, resulting in some workforce reductions. We believe that recent investments in technology may also provide opportunities to build efficiencies. We increased our net interest income in 2022, however, we experienced a decrease in non-interest income, specifically in areas which are impacted by interest rates. We remain focused on improving current noninterest income product lines, such as SBA and swap fees, and are pursuing new revenue channels related to payments and banking-as-a-service. 

Expanding offerings to small-to-medium sized business . Another priority for the Company is expanding offerings for small-to-medium sized business with a focus on entrepreneurs. We intend to accomplish this through the commercial team, with a focus on systems and support, the further development of treasury management and our partnership with The Meriwether Group, LLC. For small-to-medium sized businesses, we believe there are multiple payment opportunities for ACH processing, check processing, wire transfers, international payments and debit card interchange. In addition, we intend to build out our capabilities for accounts payable and receivable, payroll, merchant card acquisition and corporate card spend management. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 We have certain accounting policies that are important to the assessment of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 
 
 The following represent our critical accounting policies: 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: the likelihood of default; the loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; the value of collateral; and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews, and the Board of Directors approves, at least quarterly, the level of the allowance and the provision for loan losses based on past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the DFI, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment about information available at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions for loan losses to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights. We record servicing rights on loans originated and subsequently sold into the secondary market. We stratify our capitalized servicing rights based on the type, term and interest rates of the underlying loans. Effective January 1, 2022, the Bank elected to measure servicing rights using the fair value method of accounting. Servicing rights are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the change reported in earnings. Prior to 2022, the amortization method was applied with servicing rights initially recognized at fair value and subsequent changes in value amortized over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency rate assumptions as inputs. All of these assumptions require a significant degree of management judgment. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the value of our mortgage servicing rights could be negatively affected. See Notes 1, 6 and 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Income Taxes . Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate certain tax liabilities and to determine the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. We also estimate a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. In evaluating the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, recent cumulative losses - both capital and operating - and the forecast of future taxable income, both capital gains and operating. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require judgments about future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. 
 
 Fair Value. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. In the absence of quoted market prices, management determines the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing services. 

New Accounting Pronouncements

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 
 
 Assets . Total assets increased 121.0 million, or 6.3 , to 2.04 billion at December 31, 2022, from 1.92 billion at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Total loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 177.2 million, or 13.1 , during the year ended December 31, 2022. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans increased 108.1 million, or 20.2 , consisting mainly of an increase in multi-family real estate loans of 81.1 million as a result of new originations and 17.6 million of construction loans converting into permanent amortizing loans. The commercial real estate loans increase was due to new loan originations in addition to 12.2 million from construction loans converting into permanent amortizing loans. Auto and other consumer loans increased 40.0 million, or 21.9 , with the purchase of a pool of manufactured home loans as well as purchases of individual manufactured home loans and specialty auto loans. Commercial business loans decreased 2.8 million due to a decrease in the Northpointe Bank Mortgage Participation Program of 26.3 million as our participation in the program ended and 14.5 million in payoffs of SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans, partially offset by purchases of 8.1 million in secured equipment loans and 6.3 million of unsecured Bankers Healthcare Group loans in addition to advances on new and existing lines of credit. 
 
 One- to four-family residential loans increased 48.9 million, or 16.6 , with 40.5 million in construction loans converting to permanent amortizing loans during the year. We continue to focus on the origination of one- to four-family mortgage loans with the intention of retaining certain adjustable-rate loans that may not be readily sold in the secondary market, while selling the majority of our saleable production to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and other investors. 
 
 Construction and land loans decreased 30.1 million, or 13.4 , with draws on new and existing loans partially offset by 79.3 million converting into fully amortizing loans. Undisbursed construction commitments totaled 120.7 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 194.3 million at December 31, 2021. Undisbursed construction commitments at December 31, 2022 included 68.1 million of mainly custom one- to four-family residential construction, 38.7 million of multi-family construction, 13.0 million of commercial real estate construction, and 1.0 million of commercial acquisition-renovation construction. Our construction loans are geographically disbursed throughout the state of Washington with two commitments for properties in Idaho and one commitment for a property in Oregon. We manage our construction lending by utilizing a licensed third-party vendor to assist us in monitoring our construction projects. Internal staff monitor certain projects, which enhances fee income related to these loans.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company originated 548.3 million of loans, of which 122.8 million, or 22.4 , were originated in the Olympic Peninsula region; 356.7 million, or 65.1 , in the Puget Sound region; 46.4 million, or 8.5 , in other areas in Washington; and 22.2 million, or 4.1 , in other states. The Company also purchased loans totaling 96.1 million with the largest concentration of personal property located in California.

Our allowance for loan losses increased 1.0 million, or 6.6 , during the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of loan growth. Asset quality has remained stable year over year despite the uncertain economic conditions as the Federal Reserve Board has attempted to curb inflation by increasing the Federal Funds Rate. Management continues to closely monitor these and other economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.05 at December 31, 2022 and 1.11 at December 31, 2021. We believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio. 
 
 Nonperforming loans increased 409,000, or 29.6 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 to 1.8 million. This increase was mainly the result of increases in nonperforming one- to four-family of 463,000 and auto and other consumer of 60,000, partially offset by a decrease in home equity loans of 88,000. Nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.12 at December 31, 2022, an increase from 0.10 at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2022, substantially all restructured loans were performing in accordance with their modified payment terms and returned to accrual status. Classified loans, consisting solely of substandard loans, increased by 4.3 million, or 34.3 , to 16.9 million at December 31, 2022, from 12.6 million at December 31, 2021. The change in classified loans was mainly the result of one 14.0 million commercial multifamily construction loan being downgraded during the fourth quarter due to additional liens being placed on the property, and was partially offset by commercial real estate loan upgrades and payoffs. The Bank continued to work with its borrowers to facilitate satisfactory repayment. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 80.4 million, or 63.8 , to 45.6 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 126.0 million at December 31, 2021, as excess cash was deployed into funding loans. 
 
 Total investment securities decreased 17.6 million, or 5.1 , to 326.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 344.2 million at December 31, 2021. The year-over-year decrease was the result of a decline in the market value of the portfolio, sales and normal amortization during the year, partially offset by purchases. During 2022, we purchased 78.7 million of availa ble-for-sale securities. We also took advantage of market opportunities to manage duration by selling 11.9 million of available-for-sale securities for a total gain of 118,000 during the same period. The decline in market value of 51.3 million relates mainly to changes in interest rates and market liquidity, not to changes in credit quality. The estimated average life of the total investment securities portfolio was 8.2 years, and the average repricing term was approximate ly 5.7 years as of December 31, 2022, based on the interest rate environment at that time. We anticipate the investment portfolio will continue to provide additional interest income and act as a source of liquidity. 
 
 Mortgage-backed securities represent the largest portion of our investment portfolio and totaled 169.0 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 29.0 million, or 20.7 from 140.0 million at December 31, 2021. Municipal bonds are the second largest segment, totaling 98.1 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 15.3 million, or 13.5 , from 113.4 million at December 31, 2021. Other investment securities, including U.S. and international government agencies and corporate debt securities, were 59.6 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 31.3 million, or 34.5 from 90.9 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the investment portfolio contained 50.8 of amortizing securities, compared to 49.8 at December 31, 2021. The projected average life of our securities may vary due to prepayment activity, which, particularly in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, is generally affected by changing interest rates. We continue to focus on growing our loan portfolio and improving our earning asset mix over the long term, as evidenced by net loan growth exceeding the rate of investments during the year. We may purchase investment securities as a source of additional interest income and in lieu of carrying higher cash balances at nominal interest rates. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Equity and partnership investments increased 10.7 million to 14.3 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.6 million at December 31, 2021, as we expanded partnership and equity relationships to include the three Meriwether Group investments and JAM FINTOP. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased 20.2 million to 42.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 22.2 million one year ago. The increase was mainly due to an increase in deferred tax assets of 11.2 million resulting from the fair market value decrease in the investment portfolio, an increase in other prepaid expenses of 3.9 million, which includes long-term sponsorship agreements with two local not-for-profit organizations, and a receivable for a bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") death benefit payment related to the passing of a former employee. In December 2022, Quin Ventures sold substantially all of its assets to Quil Ventures. As part of the sale transaction, the Company received a 5 ownership stake in Quil Ventures valued at 225,000 and recorded a 1.5 million commitment receivable. 
 
 Liabilities. Total liabilities increased 153.2 million, or 8.9 , to 1.88 billion at December 31, 2022, from 1.73 billion at December 31, 2021, mainly due to an increase in borrowings of 166.1 million, or 139.2 , to 285.4 million at December 31, 2022, from 119.3 million at December 31, 2021, used to fund loan growth. 
 
 Deposit account balances decreased 16.3 million, or 1.0 , to 1.56 billion at December 31, 2022 from 1.58 billion at December 31, 2021. Money market accounts decreased 124.8 million and transaction accounts decreased 32.3 million, while savings accounts increased 6.3 million. Certificates of deposit increased 134.4 million, or 54.4 , to 381.7 million at December 31, 2022. Included in certificates of deposit balances at year end were 133.9 million in brokered certificates of deposit. We believe the current rate environment has contributed to greater competition for deposits with higher rate products being offered to attract new funds. Additionally, the significant deposit balance increases in 2020 and 2021 from stimulus payments and PPP loans began to run off in 2022 as business and consumer post-pandemic spending increased, fueled in part by inflation. Our focus will continue to be on increasing core customer deposits, with an emphasis on small-to-medium sized business deposits, and maintaining a stable source of funding for our continued growth.

Equity . Total shareholders' equity decreased 29.4 million, or 15.4 , to 161.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 191.0 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease during the year resulted from a 40.8 million change in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the change in unrealized market value of available for sale securities, net of tax. Share repurchases of 5.9 million and 2.8 million in dividends paid in 2022 also contributed to the decrease in equity. These decreases were partially offset by net income of 15.7 million, an increase of 2.6 million related to share-based compensation plans and 1.9 million related to the issuance of common stock as consideration for the acquisition of 33 of The Meriwether Group, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 356,343 shares of common stock at an average cost of 15.26 per share, pursuant to the Company's 2020 stock repurchase plan. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 General. The Company generated a return on average assets of 0.79 , and a return on average equity of 9.09 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.87 and 8.19 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net income increased 227,000, or 1.5 , compared to 2021. An increase in net interest income was offset by a decrease in noninterest income and increase in noninterest expense. Noninterest income was down due to significant declines in gain on sale of loans and gains on partnership investments. Noninterest expense was higher due to increased compensation, advertising, data processing, and occupancy expenses. The increases in expense were primarily related to Quin and expansion of the Bank's staffing levels and locations. We earned 1.71 per common and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.63 per common and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in earnings per share was the result of an increase in net income combined with lower weighted-average common shares outstanding of 9,082,032 in 2022, compared to 9,133,953 shares for the same period in 2021. The decrease in average shares year-over-year is due to our share repurchase program and restricted stock award forfeitures offset by restricted stock award grants. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 11.6 million, or 19.8 , to 69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly as the result of additional interest income related to an increase in the average balances of loans receivable as well higher yields earned on both loans receivable and investment securities. 
 
 The average balance of loans receivable increased 208.9 million, at an average yield of 4.74 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to an average yield of 4.44 , for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.73 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 0.43 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The combination of increased loan receivable balances and higher rates resulted in a 28 basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.79 at December 31, 2022, from 3.51 at December 31, 2021, as loans repriced faster than deposit costs. 
 
 Net interest income increased 11.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 7.0 million was the result of an increase in volume and 4.6 million due to changes in yields. As noted above, loans receivable was the main contributor to the increase in net interest income with 9.3 million due to an increase in average volume and 4.3 million due higher rates. The increase to the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to increased average balances and higher rates paid on advances, certificates of deposit and money market accounts. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 16.7 million, or 26.2 , to 80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 63.7 million for the comparable period in 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased 13.6 million during the year, in part, as the Bank grew the loan portfolio through single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate lending as well as purchased auto and manufactured home loans. Loan yields also increased due to higher rates on new originations as well as the repricing of variable rate loans tied to the Prime Rate or other indices.

Interest income on investment securities increased 2.5 million to 10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income on investment securities was driven by an increase in the average yield during the year of 81 basis points due to the repricing of variable rate securities as slowing prepayment activity reduced the amount of premium amortization during the period.

Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 5.1 million, or 95.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, with increases in borrowing costs of 3.3 million and deposit costs of 1.8 million. Borrowing rates increased 12.4 , or 29 basis points, mainly due to higher rates paid on overnight and short-term borrowings, combined with an increase of 118.1 million in the average balance outstanding. Deposit costs increased due to higher rates paid and an increase of 73.9 million, or 6.4 , in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, as we utilized brokered certificates of deposits to offset the decline in customer balances. The average cost of all interest-bearing deposit products increased 13 basis points to 0.42 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.29 for the year ended December 31, 2021. While the average balances of all deposit categories increased year-over-year, growth in lower costing transaction, savings and money market accounts outpaced higher costing certificates of deposit accounts.

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. The higher provision is reflective of loan growth and an increase in net charge-offs. Credit quality metrics improved slightly resulting in a lower allowance to total gross loans compared to the prior year.

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 34.0 to 10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Decreases compared to the prior year were primarily due to lower gain on sale of mortgage loans, lower gains on investment security sales, a 1.1 million decrease to the change in market value of our limited partnership fintech investments included in "other income" and a decline in the value of the loan servicing rights asset. These decreases were partially offset by additional service fee income and the BOLI death benefit payment.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased to 62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase reflects higher data processing and occupancy expenses associated with expanding our footprint with additional branch locations as well as higher professional fees, including legal and technology consulting fees. 
 
 Additional Quin expenses resulted in significant increases to advertising, compensation, depreciation and data processing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022, totaling approximately 3.5 million. The full amount of Quin Ventures activity is reported in noninterest income and noninterest expense under the controlling interest method of accounting. The proportional noncontrolling interest amount is later subtracted from net income. This resulted in a noncontrolling interest net loss of 2.1 million being added back to net income for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, future additional expenses related to Quin are expected to be immaterial.

Provision for Income Tax. The provision for income tax for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 2.9 million compared to 3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting differences in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate decreased over prior periods as a result of the permanent tax exclusion of BOLI noninterest income, including the BOLI death benefit.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following tables present the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The presentation distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk 
 
 Risk Management Overview. Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee reports key risk indicators to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. The most prominent risk exposures management monitors are strategic, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, compliance, reputational, cybersecurity, and legal risk. We utilize the services of outside firms to assist us in our asset and liability management and our analysis of market risk.

Table of Contents 

Interest Rate Risk Management. We manage the interest rate sensitivity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts may reprice more quickly in response to changes in market interest rates because of their shorter maturities. Certain adjustable-rate investment securities, home equity lines of credit, and commercial real estate loans that are tied to the prime rate, the twelve-month constant maturity treasury, the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("TSOFR") will also reprice higher when market interest rates increase. Increases in interest rates should beneficially affect our earnings when variable or adjustable interest-earning assets reprice at higher interest rates faster than it takes for deposit and borrowing costs to reprice higher. Decreases in interest rates may adversely affect earnings as variable and adjustable assets will reprice lower which will reduce interest income. Given the current low cost of funding there is little ability to reduce funding costs to offset the decrease in interest income. Additionally, lower rates may result in increased prepayments and refinancing associated with loans and investment securities, particularly consumer and one- to four-family residential loans and MBS securities with no prepayment restrictions, which are then reinvested into lower yielding assets, further reducing interest income. 
 
 We currently do not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis. Management uses an interest rate sensitivity analysis to review our level of interest rate risk. This analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in the present value of our cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The present value of equity is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. This analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 400 basis point increase or a 100 to 300 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any future steps that management might take to counter the impact of that interest rate movement. The following table presents the change in the present value of First Fed s equity at December 31, 2022, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on management's assumptions.

Assumptions made by management relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates, and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may take longer to adjust to changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets have features, such as rate caps or floors, which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. 
 
 Liquidity Management 
 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of investment security principal and interest payments, deposit inflows, brokered deposits, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are usually predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments on loans and investment securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition, which can cause those sources of funds to fluctuate. 
 
 Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies. 
 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents followed by available for sale securities. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled 45.6 million, and securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional potential sources of liquidity, had a market value of 326.6 million. We have pledged loan collateral to support borrowings from the FHLB of 234.0 million. We have also pledged collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure discount window advances; the Company has performed periodic borrowing tests, however, no funds were borrowed as of December 31, 2022 . First Northwest has a 20.0 million borrowing arrangement with NexBank which is secured by First Northwest's personal property assets (with certain exclusions), including all the outstanding shares of First Fed, cash, loans receivable, and limited partnership investments. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 25,000 in loan commitments outstanding and an additional 226.6 million in undisbursed loans, including undisbursed construction commitments, and standby letters of credit. 
 
 Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022 totaled 262.2 million, or 68.7 of certificates of deposit. The large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers' hesitancy to invest their funds for longer periods in this changing rate environment. Management believes that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will be renewed or rolled into new certificates of deposit given the current rate environment. If these maturing deposits are not renewed or rolled into other deposit products, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, which may include borrowings and brokered deposits. We also can attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered, including the offering of promotional rates on certificates of deposit to encourage the renewal or rollover of maturing certificates of deposit and mitigate the risk of loss of these deposits to our competitors. Depending on market conditions, we may also be required to pay higher rates on borrowings or brokered deposits than we currently pay on standard certificates of deposit or promotional rate offerings. We believe that business developed by our sales teams, including our commercial relationship managers, branch managers and members of our branch network, and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities, will afford us enough long-term liquidity. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
 
 First Fed has a diversified deposit base with approximately 62 of deposit account balances held by consumers, 29 held by business and public fund depositors, and 9 in brokered deposits. The average deposit account balance, excluding brokered and public fund accounts, was 29,000 at December 31, 2022. We estimate that 20-25 of our retail customer deposit balances are over the 250,000 FDIC insurance limit, representing less than 5 of depositors. Management believes that maintaining a diversified deposit base is an important factor in managing liquidity.

Table of Contents 

The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and relies on dividends from its subsidiary, First Fed, and cash received from the issuance of subordinated debt for liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. At December 31, 2022, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 1.0 million. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
 
 In the normal course of operations, First Fed engages in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Capital Resources 
 
 First Northwest Bancorp is a financial holding company (a type of bank holding company) subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, First Fed, is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. Capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. 
 
 First Fed is subject to meeting minimum capital adequacy requirements for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and tier 1 capital ("leverage"). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
 
 First Fed is subject to capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. See Item 1, "Business-How We Are Regulated," and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed s regulatory capital requirements.

Table of Contents 

In order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions, First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed must maintain CET1 capital at an amount greater than the required minimum levels plus a capital conservation buffer. This new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in starting in January 2016 until fully implemented in the amount of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets in January 2019. As of December 31, 2022, the conservation buffer was 2.5 . 
 
 Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy for First Fed is to maintain its "well-capitalized" status in accordance with regulatory standards. At December 31, 2022, the Bank and consolidated Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was considered "well capitalized" under FDIC regulatory capital guidelines.

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
 First Northwest Bancorp and Subsidiary 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Northwest Bancorp and Subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the (consolidated) financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the (consolidated) financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the (consolidated) financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated allowance for loan losses balance was 16 million at December 31, 2022. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to provide for estimated inherent losses based upon the Company's analysis of the known and inherent risk factors underlying the loan portfolio. These factors include, among others, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and determination of the discounted cash flows or determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans. 
 
 We identified management's estimation of qualitative factor adjustments, which are a component of the allowance for loan losses calculation, as a critical audit matter. Qualitative factor adjustments are added to the historical loss rates and applied to the loan balances with similar risk characteristics to calculate the allowance for loan losses. The qualitative factor adjustments are comprised of subjective risk factor adjustments used to quantify an estimate of losses that are not captured in the historical loss rates and are based on management's evaluation of available internal and external data and involves significant management judgment. In turn, auditing management's judgments regarding the determination of the qualitative factor adjustments applied to the allowance for loan losses involved a high degree of subjectivity. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Obtained management's analysis and supporting documentation related to the qualitative factor adjustments and tested whether the qualitative factor adjustments used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses were supported by the analysis provided by management, as well as tested source data used in management's analysis. 
 Performed an independent sensitivity analysis to evaluate the reasonableness of the qualitative factor adjustments used by management to account for inherent losses that are not captured in the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss rates alone. 
 Tested the qualitative factor adjustments were applied appropriately in the allowance for loan losses calculation.

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of common stock at an offering price of per share for gross proceeds of million. An additional shares of Company common stock and in cash were contributed to the First Federal Community Foundation ("Foundation"), a charitable foundation that was established in connection with the Conversion, resulting in the issuance of a total of shares. The Company received million in net proceeds from the stock offering of which million were contributed to the Bank upon Conversion. 
 
 At the time of Conversion, the Bank established a liquidation account in an amount equal to its total net worth, approximately million, as of June 30, 2014, the latest statement of financial condition appearing in First Northwest's prospectus. The liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of eligible depositors who continue to maintain their accounts at the Bank after the Conversion. The liquidation account is reduced annually to the extent that eligible depositors have reduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible holder s interest in the liquidation account. In the event of a complete liquidation, each eligible depositor will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account in an amount proportionate to the current adjusted qualifying balances for accounts then held. The liquidation account balance is not available for payment of dividends, and the Bank may not pay dividends if those dividends would reduce equity capital below the required liquidation account amount. 
 
 Pursuant to the Conversion, the Bank s Board of Directors adopted an ESOP which purchased in the open market of the common stock originally issued for a total of shares. As of December 15, 2015, shares, or of the total, had been purchased. As of December 31, 2022 , First Northwest had allocated shares from the total shares purchased to participants. 
 
 In April 2021, First Northwest entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement") with the Bank, Peace of Mind, Inc. ("POM"), and Quin Ventures, Inc. ("Quin" or "Quin Ventures"). First Northwest extended million to Quin Ventures under a capital financing agreement and related promissory note and issued shares of the Company's common stock to POM with a value of . Quin Ventures sold substantially all of its assets in December 2022 to Quil Ventures, Inc., at which time POM returned the shares previously issued and the joint venture agreement was terminated. As part of the sale transaction, the Company received a ownership stake in Quil Ventures valued at and recorded a million commitment receivable. First Northwest continues to maintain a controlling interest in Quin Ventures. 
 On October 31, 2021, the Bank converted from a State Savings Bank Charter to a State Commercial Bank Charter and was simultaneously renamed First Fed Bank from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles. 
 
 On August 5, 2022, First Northwest's election to be treated as a financial holding company became effective, allowing the Company to engage in non-banking activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. 
 
 First Northwest, the Bank, and Quin Ventures are collectively referred to as the "Company." 
 
 First Northwest's business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investments in First Fed and Quin Ventures. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. 
 
 The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution providing commercial and consumer banking services to individuals and businesses primarily in Western Washington State with offices in Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap, King, and Whatcom counties. These services include deposit and lending transactions that are supplemented with borrowing and investing activities. 

trading securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . Investment securities are categorized as held-to-maturity when First Fed has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. First Fed had held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . Securities that are held-to-maturity are stated at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income. Investment securities categorized as available for sale are generally held for investment purposes (to maturity), although unanticipated future events may result in the sale of some securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized holding gain or loss reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains or losses are determined using the amortized cost basis of securities sold using the specific identification method and are included in earnings. Dividend and interest income on investments are recognized when earned. Premiums and discounts on securities without call features are recognized in interest income using the level yield method over the period to maturity. Premiums on securities with call features are amortized to the earliest call date. The Company reviews investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. For debt securities, the Company considers whether management intends to sell a security or if it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity. For debt securities, if management intends to sell the security or it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized as OTTI and charged against earnings. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the security, but management does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected. Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI. The remaining impairment related to all other factors, i.e., the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value, is recognized as a charge to OCI. Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within OCI. If there is an indication of additional credit losses, the security is re-evaluated according to the procedures described above. 

million and million, respectively. First Fed was in compliance with the FHLB minimum investment requirement at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . First Fed may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the amount First Fed is required to hold. Stock redemptions are granted at the discretion of the FHLB. Management evaluates FHLB stock for impairment based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as 1 the significance of any decline in net assets of the FHLB compared with the capital stock amount for the FHLB and the length of time this situation has persisted, 2 commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB, 3 the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, the customer base of the FHLB, and 4 the liquidity position of the FHLB. Based on its evaluation, First Fed did not recognize an OTTI loss on its FHLB stock at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . 

Each loan segment and class inherently contains differing credit risk profiles depending on the unique aspects of that segment or class of loans. For example, borrowers tend to consider their primary residence and access to transportation for employment-related purposes as basic requirements; accordingly, many consumers prioritize making payments on real estate first -mortgage loans and vehicle loans. Conversely, second -mortgage real estate loans or unsecured loans may not be supported by sufficient collateral; thus, in the event of financial hardship, borrowers may tend to place less importance on maintaining these loans as current and the Bank may not have adequate collateral to provide a secondary source of repayment in the event of default. Notwithstanding the various risk profiles unique to each class of loan, management believes that the credit risk for all loans is similarly dependent on essentially the same factors, including the financial strength of the borrower, the cash flow available to service maturing debt obligations, the condition and value of underlying collateral, the financial strength of any guarantors, and other factors. Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that First Fed will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement. The carrying value of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate or, for collateral dependent loans, at fair value of the collateral, less selling costs. If the measurement of each impaired loan s value is less than the recorded investment in the loan, First Fed recognizes this impairment and adjusts the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the allowance for loan losses. This can be accomplished by charging off the impaired portion of the loan or establishing a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan losses. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For those loans placed on non-accrual status due to payment delinquency, return to accrual status will generally not occur until the borrower demonstrates repayment ability over a period of not less than six months. 

The ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond First Fed s control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review First Fed s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require First Fed to recognize additional provisions for loan losses based on their judgment using information available to them at the time of their examination. Allowances for losses on specific problem loans are charged to income when it is determined that the value of these loans and properties, in the judgment of management, is impaired. First Fed accounts for impaired loans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310 - 10 - 35, Receivables Overall Subsequent Measurement . A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that First Fed will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured by using discounted cash flows, except when it is determined that the sole source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral. In such cases, impairment is measured at current fair value generally based on a current appraisal of the collateral, reduced by estimated selling costs. When the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including collected interest that has been applied to principal, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premiums or discounts), loan impairment is recognized by establishing or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses. Uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the principal balance. The impairment amount for small balance homogeneous loans is calculated using the adjusted historical loss rate for the class and risk category related to each loan, unless the loan is subject to a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). A TDR is a loan for which First Fed, for reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that First Fed would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to the borrower s financial difficulty include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity; an interest rate below market; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or extension, deferral, renewal, or rewrite of the original loan terms. The restructured loans may be classified "special mention" or "substandard" depending on the severity of the modification. Loans that were paid current at the time of modification may be upgraded in their classification after a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. Loans that are past due at the time of modification are classified "substandard" and placed on nonaccrual status. TDR loans may be upgraded in their classification and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is a reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. First Fed allows reclassification of a troubled debt restructuring back into the general loan pool (as a non-troubled debt restructuring) if the borrower is able to refinance the loan at then-current market rates and meet all of the underwriting criteria of First Fed required of other borrowers. The refinance must be based on the borrower s ability to repay the debt and no special concessions of rate and/or term are granted to the borrower. In March 2020, the Company announced loan modification programs to support and provide relief for its borrowers during the novel coronavirus of 2019 ("COVID- 19" pandemic. The Company followed the loan modification criteria within the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 ("CARES Act"), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and interagency guidance from the federal banking agencies when determining if a borrower's modification was subject to a TDR classification. Modifications not meeting the criteria under the CARES Act or interagency guidance to be excluded from TDR classification were evaluated under the existing TDR framework. Loans subject to forbearance under the COVID- 19 loan modification program were not reported as past due or placed on non-accrual status during the forbearance time period, and interest income continued to be recognized over the contractual life of the loans. 

Sold loan servicing income represents fees earned for servicing loans. Fees for servicing sold loans are generally based upon a percentage of the principal balance of the loans serviced, as well as related ancillary income such as late charges. Servicing income is recognized as earned unless collection is doubtful. The caption in the consolidated statement of income "Sold loan servicing fees" includes sold loan servicing income and changes in fair value for the year ending December 31, 2022. For years prior to 2022, it includes sold loan servicing income, amortization of loan servicing rights, the effects of sold loan servicing run-off, and impairment, if applicable.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 - 13, Financial Instruments - Credit Loss , with subsequent amendments issued in ASU 2018 - 19, ASU 2019 - 04 and ASU 2019 - 05. This ASU updates the guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets. The new requirements, known as the current expected credit loss model (CECL) will require entities to adopt an impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. ASU No. 2016 - 13 is now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, the Company will change processes and procedures to calculate the allowance for loan losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. In addition, the current accounting policy and procedures for other-than-temporary impairment on investment securities available for sale will be replaced with an allowance approach. Additional updates were issued in ASU No. 2019 - 04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 825 ), Financial Instruments . This ASU clarifies and improves guidance related to the previously issued standards on credit losses, hedging and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The amendments provide entities with various measurement alternatives and policy elections related to accounting for credit losses and accrued interest receivable balances. Entities are also able to elect a practical expedient to separately disclose the total amount of accrued interest included in the amortized cost basis as a single balance to meet certain disclosure requirements. The amendments clarify that the estimated allowance for credit losses should include all expected recoveries of financial assets and trade receivables that were previously written off and expected to be written off. The amendments also allow entities to use projections of future interest rate environments when using a discounted cash flow method to measure expected credit losses on variable-rate financial instruments. In addition, new updates were issued through ASU No. 2019 - 05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326 ): Targeted Transition Relief . This amendment allows entities to elect the fair value option on certain financial instruments. On adoption, an entity is allowed to irrevocably elect the fair value option on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This alternative is available for all instruments in the scope of Subtopic 326 - 20 except for existing held-to-maturity debt securities. If an entity elects the fair value option, the difference between the instrument s fair value and carrying amount is recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company evaluated the provisions of ASU No. 2016 - 13, ASU No. 2019 - 04 and ASU No. 2019 - 05, to determine the potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. We estimate the implementation of these ASUs will increase the combined balances for the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitment liability - with a related decrease to equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company's internal project management team reviewed models, worked with our third -party vendor, and implemented changes to processes and procedures to ensure the Company was fully compliant with the amendments at the adoption date. Early adoption was permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2023. 
 Other ASUs not yet adopted In March 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020 - 04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . ASU 2020 - 04 provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. On December 31, 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022 - 06 which deferred the sunset date for Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. The Company is implementing a transition plan to identify and modify its loans and other financial instruments that are either directly or indirectly influenced by LIBOR. The Company continues to evaluate ASU No. 2020 - 04 and its impact on the Company s transition away from LIBOR for its loan and other financial instruments, with no material expected impact on the Company's financial statements. In March 2022, FASB issued ASU No. 2022 - 01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815 ): Fair Value Hedging Portfolio Layer Method. This update will allow non-prepayable financial assets to be included in a closed portfolio hedge using the portfolio method, rather than only prepayable assets. It also allows entities to hedge multiple layers rather than just a single layer of closed portfolio of financial assets or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of financial instruments. This ASU, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

The Company may hold certain investment securities in an unrealized loss position that are not considered OTTI. At December 31, 2022 , there were investment securities with million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately million. At December 31, 2021 , there were investment securities with million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately million. 

Management believes that the unrealized losses on investment securities relate principally to the general change in interest rates and poor market liquidity, and not to changes in credit quality, that has occurred since the initial purchase. These unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate level fluctuations in the future. Certain investments in a loss position are guaranteed by government entities or government sponsored entities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and believes it is not likely it will be required to sell these investments prior to a market price recovery or maturity. 
 
 There were OTTI losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 .

Credit quality indicator - Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful, or loss; risk ratings 6, 7, and 8 in our 8 -point risk rating system, respectively. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and pay capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that First Fed will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
 
 When First Fed classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish a specific allowance to address the risk specifically or First Fed may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities but that, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Assets that do not currently expose First Fed to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are designated as either watch or special mention assets; risk ratings 4 and 5 in our risk rating system, respectively. Loans not otherwise classified are considered pass graded loans and are rated 1 - 3 in our risk rating system. 
 
 Additionally, First Fed categorizes loans as performing or nonperforming based on payment activity. Loans that are more than 90 days past due and nonaccrual loans are considered nonperforming.

As a result of the bad debt deductions taken in years prior to 1988, retained earnings include accumulated earnings of approximately million, on which federal income taxes have not been provided. If, in the future, this portion of retained earnings is used for any purpose other than to absorb losses on loans or on property acquired through foreclosure, federal income taxes may be imposed at the then-prevailing corporate tax rates. The Company does not contemplate that such amounts will be used for any purpose that would create a federal income tax liability; therefore, no provision has been made. 
 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , the Company, through its investment in Quin Ventures, has a net operating loss carryforward of million that originated post December 31, 2017, that is not subject to expiration and is able to offset 80 of future taxable income. There were no federal tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 2021 . 
 
 The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC 740 that require the application of a more-likely-than- not recognition criterion for the reporting of uncertain tax positions on its financial statements. The Company had unrecognized tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . Interest and penalties are recognized in income tax expense. The Company recognized a small amount of interest and penalties during the year ended December 31, 2022 , and no interest or penalties during the year ended December 31, 2021 . The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ending before December 31, 2019 .

, a Tier 1 capital ratio of , a total capital ratio of , and a leverage ratio of . In addition to the minimum regulatory capital ratios, First Northwest Bancorp and First Fed must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than of risk-weighted assets in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of retained income that could be utilized for such actions. At December 31, 2022 , the Bank's CETI capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer. 
 
 At periodic intervals, banking regulators routinely examine First Northwest and First Fed as part of their legally prescribed oversight of the banking industry. A future examination could include a review of certain transactions or other amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on these examinations, the regulators can direct that the Company's consolidated financial statements be adjusted in accordance with their findings. In view of the uncertain regulatory environment in which First Northwest and First Fed operate, the extent, if any, to which a forthcoming regulatory examination may ultimately result in adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements cannot presently be determined. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , First Fed exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022 , the most recent regulatory notifications categorized First Fed as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

 Legal contingencies - Various legal claims may arise from time to time in the normal course of business, which, in the opinion of management, have no current material effect on First Fed s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Significant group concentrations of credit risk - Concentration of credit risk is the risk associated with a lack of diversification, such as having substantial loan concentrations in a specific type of loan within First Fed s loan portfolio, thereby exposing First Fed to greater risks resulting from adverse economic, political, regulatory, geographic, industrial, or credit developments. Loans to one borrower are subject to the state banking regulations general limitation of 20 percent of First Fed s equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income.

These loans totaled approximately billion and billion, or and , of First Fed s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Real estate construction, including land acquisition and land development, commercial real estate, multi-family, home equity, and one - to four -family residential loans, are included in the total loans secured by real estate for purposes of this calculation.

million in cash. There were no transfers of common stock or other equity instruments in connection with the transaction, and the Bank did not obtain any equity interests in Sterling. 
 
 The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value as of the July 23, 2021, transaction date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill arising from the transaction consists largely of a premium paid for the deposit accounts. 
 
 In most instances, determining the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities required the Bank to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at the appropriate rate of interest. Differences may arise between contractually required payments and the expected cash flows at the acquisition date due to items such as prepayments or early withdrawals, and other factors. Goodwill is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes as, under the terms of the transaction, the Bank purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Sterling but did not acquire any equity or other ownership interests. 
 
 The following table summarizes the fair value of consideration transferred, the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and the resulting goodwill relating to the transaction (in thousands):

 CDI represents the value assigned to demand, interest checking, money market and savings accounts acquired as part of an acquisition. CDI represents the future economic benefit of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost of alternative funding sources. CDI is amortized to non-interest expense using an accelerated method based on an estimated runoff of related deposits over a period of ten years. CDI is evaluated for impairment and recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any changes in estimated useful life accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining life.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act") was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company s senior management as of the end of the period covered by this report. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of December 31, 2022 were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act was (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. First Northwest Bancorp's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act. The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 This process includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As a result of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) . Based on that assessment, the Company's management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, First Northwest Bancorp's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
