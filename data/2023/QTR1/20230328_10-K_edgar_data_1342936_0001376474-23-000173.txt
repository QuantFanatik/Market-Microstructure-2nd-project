PART I 
 Item 1. Business. 
 
 General Overview. 
 
 Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (the Company , we or us ), is a software development company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. We specialize in creating interface and application solutions for speech recognition technologies. Our speech recognition software and related firmware was first introduced in 1994 at an industry trade show. We currently have limited capital resources. We are not currently engaged in marketing any products. We are currently engaged in discussions with a certain firm dedicated to assisting in the commercialization of intellectual assets. 
 
 Our principal assets are our patents. We currently hold six issued patents. U.S. Patent #7,558,730 the 730 entitled Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols discloses a system for facilitating speech recognition and transcription among users employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging speech. U.S. Patent #7,949,534, the 534 entitled Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols, is an expansion of the coverage of the 730 patent and incorporates speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible protocols. U.S. Patent #8,131,557, the 557 entitled Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols, is an expansion of the coverage of AVRS s 730 and the 534 patents and incorporates speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing, and exchanging speech among users employing incompatible protocols utilizing peer-to-peer networks, node-to-node networks, and the cloud. U.S. Patent #8,498,871, the 871 entitled Dynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols, is a system for facilitating free form dictation, including directed dictation and constrained recognition and /or structured transcription among users having heterogeneous protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging recognized and transcribed speech. U.S. Patent #9,142,217, the 217 entitled Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols, is an expansion of the coverage of the 871. U.S. Patent #9,934,786 the 786 was issued April 3, 2018 and is an extension of the coverage in the 871 patent. Our business strategy is to attempt to interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to enforce and defend our patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as appropriate. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 
 We believe that speech recognition technology has a multitude of potential applications including but not limited to dictation and transcription, mobile messaging (voice to texting), server-based web search, customer relations and translation. 
 
 Speech recognition technology, which provides for the conversion of speech into written text, is the threshold feature of our solutions. Our technology focuses on improving speech recognition technology by increasing speech conversion precision, with the goal of achieving near 100 accuracy and allowing the user to speak naturally. We also focus on improving user productivity and profitability by enabling the user to effectively utilize the written text produced by speech recognition technology (the End-Text) in multiple applications specific to the user s business purposes and goals. 
 
 Principal Proposed Products or Services 
 
 We have not achieved any revenues from product sales. In addition, we will need substantial additional capital to achieve our marketing 
 1 
 
 objectives as described below. 
 
 Speech Recognition Software and Related Firmware 
 
 Our principal proposed product is speech recognition software and related firmware which allows for dictation into a broad range of applications, including DOS applications running in Windows, UNIX and mainframe applications accessed through terminal emulation programs, various custom applications, and all Windows 3.x, 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 10 programs. Through this product, we seek to provide full functionality including audio proofreading, deferred and delegated correction and additional capabilities that we believe are not available with other products. This product is designed to allow for deferred dictation, where the text is saved with the associated audio, and the users can resume when stopped and can play back dictated content. Similarly, the recognized text and associated audio can be saved to be used when text is corrected. 
 
 AVRS Enterprise Solutions 
 
 AVRS patented technology is applicable to many main stream speech enabled applications ranging from traditional desktop applications to mobile, web-based and cloud solutions. The technology reaches beyond simple speech recognition and transcription into many other applications thus enabling the exchange of spoken text transcription amongst numerous users on diverse system platforms, as well as enabling the transcribed text to be utilized by many interface applications. The key is the recognition of, and in many cases the transcription of, spoken text in a myriad of applications to allow a seamless interface among users and /or systems having disparate protocols. Recognition of dictated speech including spoken text and commands, over many platforms provides operations of systems having diverse requirements and capabilities. 
 
 AVRS patents cover both a method of implementation and a system whereby speech recognition and transcription can be operated upon and exchanged amongst users employing disparate legacy protocols through one or more transaction managers having a systems protocol. An underlying key factor in all AVRS patented technology lies in its enabling capability whereby any legacy application protocol can be made compatible with speech recognition and transcription engines with or without modification of the application or the protocol upon which the initiating or the receiving application relies. 
 
 Market 
 
 We believe that our patented technology has applications in vertical markets that require individuals and organizations to create reports, letters, e-mail, data entry, manuals, books, and virtually any other document or end product involving written data. These organizations include corporations, hospitals, medical product and service providers, governmental entities, legal professionals, sales and service organizations law enforcement agencies and mobile search and voicemail to text. 
 
 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) 
 
 We believe that our patented technology has applications in OEM markets, targeting both software developers and hardware manufacturers. When we have sufficient available resources, we may approach the larger OEM companies with a joint marketing approach strategy while using a direct sale basis to approach small and medium-sized OEMs. 

Hardware Manufacturers 
 
 We believe that our patented technology has applications in hardware manufacturing, and to that end, when we have sufficient available resources, we may approach hardware manufacturers both on a direct basis and through joint sales and marketing programs. We anticipate that we will offer technology and patent licenses to manufacturers of medical devices, digital dictation systems, recorders, workstation PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, WAPs and intelligent electronics. Alternatively, we may offer these manufacturers limited versions of our speech recognition software and related firmware product line for embedding into hardware. When we have sufficient available resources, we expect to develop joint sales and marketing programs for mainframe, thin-client, telephony and other large hardware processing systems.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This document contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. When used in this document, the words expects , anticipates , intends and plans and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements made in this document should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this document.

 Results of Operation 
 
 We completed a stock exchange on May 19, 2008 and changed our business model. We have not generated any revenue since inception and do not have any cash generating product or licensing sales. We have incurred losses since Inception (March 15, 1994). 
 
 We had a net loss of 48,589 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net loss of 83,381 in 2021. Professional fees were 32,288 in 2022, as compared to 52,765 in 2021, a decrease of 20,477. A decrease in auditing fees is responsible for the decrease in professional fees. Office was 8,687 in 2022 as compared to 23,288 in 2021, a decrease of 14,601 which decreased our net loss. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used 46,499 of cash in operating activities and 0 cash in investing activities. We received 5,000 of 
 5 
 
 cash for the sale of our common stock. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a 12,010 net decrease in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we used 44,367 of cash in operating activities and 0 cash in investing activities. We received 46,000 of cash from the sale of shares of our common stock. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an 11,800 net increase in cash on hand. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had current assets of 138 and current liabilities of 343,731 as compared to current assets of 12,148 and current liabilities of 312,152 at December 31, 2021. Our decrease in current assets resulted from an decreased amount of financing activities in 2022 as compared to 2021. 
 
 Because of our history of losses, net capital deficit and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit report on our financial statements contains a going concern opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 In an attempt to address our financing needs, we have made sales of our common stock in private transactions. 
 
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we entered into one Stock Purchase Agreement for the private sale to one person or entities of an aggregate of 333,334 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of 5,000. Proceeds of 5,000 from were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. On December 29, 2022, we have issued 262,579,731 shares of AVRS Common Stock into Escrow. 
 
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale to five persons or entities of an aggregate of 4,200,000 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of 46,000. All of the proceeds were paid during the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 On March 16, 2015 we entered into a letter agreement with Adapt IP Ventures, LLC (Adapt IP) confirming the retention of Adapt IP to assist us in identifying companies that might be interested in acquiring and / or licensing our patents, to attempt to negotiate financial terms and conditions for acquisition and / or licensing and to assist with collection of compensation from such entities. Adapt IP will receive a success fee of 15 of net compensation received from such entities based upon Adapt IP s efforts. We or Adapt IP may terminate the agreement upon 30 days notice to the other party. 
 
 On April 20, 2015 we made a Promissory Note to Adapt IP for 20,000, and Adapt IP agreed to pay to our patent counsel up to 20,000 for patent work on our behalf. The Note matures one year from the date of the Note. We are obligated to repay the funds advanced by Adapt IP plus a premium of 10 of the principal amount and a percentage of proceeds received by us from any monetization event involving the patents. If we repay the Note within the six months of the date of the Note, the percentage will be 1 , and it will be 2 after six months. As of December 31, 2022 15,450 interest has accrued. 
 
 On August 20, 2015, AVRS entered into a letter agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC pursuant to which Dominion will provide strategic advisory services to AVRS to support the common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with respect to AVRS s intellectual property, including patents held by AVRS. On June 28, 2017 AVRS and Dominion agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015 Letter Agreement. AVRS did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection of the early termination of the agreement. 
 
 On November 1, 2016, AVRS entered into a Contingent Fee Agreement with Buether Joe and Carpenter, LLC to represent AVRS in connection with investigating and asserting claims including negotiating license agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits against any potential infringers of the Patent rights. On June 6, 2017 AVRS and BJC revised the Contingent Fee Agreement as it related to the termination of the August 20, 2017 Dominion Harbor Letter Agreement. 
 
 Historically, our President has loaned or advanced to us funds for working capital on an as needed basis. There is no assurance that these loans or advances will continue in the future. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we owed our officers an aggregate of 162,380 for accrued payroll. As of December 31, 2022, Walter Geldenhuys, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and who serves as a member of our Board of Directors advanced the Company 6,000. Our Secretary / Treasurer advanced the Company a total of 38,188 at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Because of our history of losses, and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit reports on our financial statements at December 31, 2022 and 2021 contained a going concern opinion regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We will require additional debt or equity financing or a combination of both in order to carry out our business plan. We plan to raise additional funds through future sales of our securities, until such time as our revenues are sufficient to meet our cost structure, and ultimately achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance we will be successful in raising additional capital or achieving profitable operations. Our board of directors may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that may consist of restricted shares of our common stock. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute our common stock book value. 
 
 To obtain sufficient funds to meet our future needs for capital, we will from time to time, evaluate opportunities to raise financing through some combination of the private sale of equity, or issuance of convertible debt securities. However, future equity or debt financing may not be available 
 6 
 
 to us at all, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. We do not intend to pay dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future.

 In order for our operations to continue, we will need to generate revenues from our intended operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cost structure. We may encounter difficulties in establishing these operations due to our inability to successfully prosecute any patent enforcement actions or our inability to effectively execute our business plan.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the shareholders and the board of directors of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, who also is our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2022 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on our review and evaluation, our chief executive officer, who also is our chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective, including consideration of the matters identified below to ensure that material information relating to us would be made known to them by others within the Company in a timely manner, particularly during the period in which this annual report on Form 10-K was being prepared, and that no changes are required at this time. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusion as to their adequacy and effectiveness, included consideration of the deficiency noted below and the fact that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is extensively involved in day-to-day transactional activities combined with the fact that the volume of transactions and activities of the Company are limited. 
 
 We have identified, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we do not believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer work closely and review all day-to-day transactional activities with the secretary Treasurer. The volume of the transactions of the Company is limited. 
 
 Management believes this lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this weakness. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and 
 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. We have identified, as of December 31, 2020, a lack of segregation of duties in accounting and financial reporting activities, which we believe is a material weakness. The size of our business necessarily imposes practical limitations on the effectiveness of those internal control practices and procedures that rely on the segregation of duties. 
 
 Management believes this deficiency in internal control did not result in material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 fairly present in all material respects the financial 
 19 
 
 condition and results of operations for the Company in conformity with GAAP. There is, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected as a result of this weakness. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 3 Due to reduced sales of shares in private offerings of common stock in 2013, 162,380 of officer compensation was accrued as payroll payable. Total Officer Compensation paid in 2022 was 3,650 and 2,650 in 2021. The Company continued to experience a reduction in income. The officers agreed that no payroll would accrue. 
 
 Salary (Column C) 
 
 The amounts reported in column C represent base salaries paid to each of the Named Executive Officers for the relevant fiscal year. 
 
 Bonus (Column D) 
 
 The amounts reported in column D represent the cash bonuses paid each of the Named Executive Officers for the relevant fiscal year. 
 
 Option Awards (Column F) 
 
 The amounts reported in column F represent the dollar amount of stock option awards recognized for each of the Named Executive Officers as compensation costs for financial reporting purposes (excluding forfeiture assumptions) in accordance with FAS 123(R) for the relevant fiscal years. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards (including stock options) made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value. We previously accounted for the stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure now known as ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. 
 
 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from similar companies that operate within the same industry sector index. We calculated the historical volatility for each comparable company to come up with an expected average volatility 
 22 
 
 and then adjusted the expected volatility based on factors such as historical stock transactions, major business transactions, and industry trends. The expected terms of the options are estimated based on factors such as vesting periods, contractual expiration dates and historical exercise behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
 
 Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change-In-Control Arrangements 
 
 We do not have written employment agreements or other employment arrangements with any of our executive officers. Our Board of Directors periodically evaluates the appropriate terms and conditions for the employment of our executive officers. 
 
 Outstanding Equity Awards At Fiscal Year End 
 
 We do not have any unexercised stock options outstanding for any of our named executive officers. 
 
 Director Compensation 
 
 We have made no arrangements for the remuneration of our directors, except that they will be entitled to receive reimbursement for actual, demonstrable out of pocket expenses, including travel expenses, if any, made on our behalf. No remuneration has been paid to our directors for services to date. 
 
 The following table sets forth all compensation paid to our directors for the last completed fiscal year.
