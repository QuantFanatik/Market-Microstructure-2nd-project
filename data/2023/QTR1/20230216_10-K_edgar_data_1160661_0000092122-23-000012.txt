 The Southern Company System 
 Traditional Electric Operating Companies 
 The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein. 
 Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance 
 I-1 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. On November 9, 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) began service. SEEM, whose members include the traditional electric operating companies and many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast, is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. The FERC's orders related to SEEM have been appealed. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties. 
 Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations. 
 Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information. 
 
 Southern Power 
 Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OVERVIEW "Business Activities" in Item 7 herein. 
 Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue power generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,501 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,121 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See "Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power pool. 
 A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling partner and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity 
 I-2 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51 to 66 . 
 See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects. 
 Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2022 was 96 through 2027 and 90 through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 44 of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 43 were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 11 were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. 
 Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment. 
 Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits. 
 Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings. 
 
 Southern Company Gas 
 Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an "all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' other businesses also included wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions, including the sale of Sequent and the sale and pending sale of the remaining facilities within the storage operations business. 
 Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains 77,591 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states. 
 Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50 interest in SNG and a 50 joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20 ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021. For additional 
 I-3 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 information on Southern Company Gas's pipeline investments, see Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein. 
 Gas marketing services is comprised of SouthStar, which serves approximately 622,000 natural gas commodity customers, markets gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and offers energy-related products that provide natural gas price stability and utility bill management in competitive markets or markets that provide for customer choice.

 Fuel Supply 
 Electric 
 The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear for Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATION "Southern Company Electricity Business Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATION under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2021 and 2022. 
 SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2023, SCS has contracted for 659 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 11 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units. 
 The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2023 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Environmental Accounting Order," "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans," and "Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information, including the Southern Company system's electric generating mix and plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity. 
 Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 12 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel. 
 
 Natural Gas 
 Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas. Demand increases beginning in 2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility, which has been exacerbated by pipeline constraints and increased exports. The Henry Hub price averaged 6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current forecasts for 2023 are approximately 3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond indicate expectations, absent unforeseen developments, that prices will modestly increase. The potential for price increases, similar to those in 2022, and high volatility remains. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas 
 I-5 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the sale of Sequent.

Details of the natural gas distribution utilities at December 31, 2022 are as follows: 
 Utility State Number of customers Approximate miles of pipe (in thousands) Nicor Gas Illinois 2,268 34.7 Atlanta Gas Light Georgia 1,707 35.3 Virginia Natural Gas Virginia 312 5.9 Chattanooga Gas Tennessee 71 1.7 Total 4,358 77.6 
 For information relating to the sources of revenue for Southern Company Gas, see Item 7 herein and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenues Southern Company Gas" and Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein. 
 
 Competition 
 Electric 
 The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply. 
 The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice. 
 Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC. 
 Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors. Further technological advancements or the implementation of policies in support of alternative energy sources may result in further competition. 
 Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2022, Alabama Power purchased approximately 68 million KWHs from such companies. The related costs were immaterial.

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 39 small IPPs. During 2022, Georgia Power purchased 6.1 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of 298 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2022, Georgia Power purchased 399 million KWHs at a cost of 37 million from these facilities. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2022, Mississippi Power did not make any such purchases. 
 
 Natural Gas 
 Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance. 
 Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. 
 Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including: 
 changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy; 
 general economic conditions; 
 energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs; 
 legislation and regulations, including certain bans on the use of natural gas in new or existing construction and electrification initiatives; 
 the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and 
 technological or regulatory changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances. 
 Southern Company Gas has natural gas-related programs that generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances. 
 
 Seasonality and Demand 
 The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions, the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the Registrants in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder. 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "General" and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS "Southern Company Gas Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively. 
 
 Regulation 
 States 
 The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information. 
 Federal Power Act 
 The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The 
 I-9 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices. 
 Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2022, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs. 
 In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC. 
 In November 2021, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa River. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023. 
 In 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro fleet capacity. 
 In December 2021, Georgia Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River. The current Lloyd Shoals project license will expire on December 31, 2023. 
 Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of 903,000 KW installed capacity. In December 2021, OPC, as an agent for co-licensees of the project, filed a notice of intent with the FERC to relicense the project. An application to relicense the project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2024. See PROPERTIES "Electric Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information. 
 Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 for Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2034-2060 for Georgia Power's projects. 
 Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
 Nuclear Regulation 
 Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws. 
 The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. On August 31, 2022, Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its intent in 2025 to seek to renew the plant's licenses for an additional 20 years (through 2054 and 2058 for Units 1 and 2, respectively). The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively. 
 In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the COL for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the Registrants. 
 
 Rate Matters 
 Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans 
 Electric 
 The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are also of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers, subject to final state PSC approval. 
 The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also see "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for additional information. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. 
 Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4 of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. 
 
 Natural Gas 
 Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. 
 With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC. 
 In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. 
 I-11

 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. 
 
 Integrated Resource Planning 
 Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet transition. 
 Alabama Power 
 Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business. Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022. During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 
 Georgia Power 
 Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" and " Rate Plans" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 
 Mississippi Power 
 Triennially, Mississippi Power must file an IRP with the Mississippi PSC, as well as an update at approximately the mid-point of the three-year cycle. The IRP must include long-term plans to best meet the needs of electric utility customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering transmission needs. The IRP filing is not intended to supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new generating resources. Mississippi Power's most recent IRP was filed in 2021 and the next IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2024. Mississippi Power must also file an annual report on energy delivery improvements, the latest of which was filed on December 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

 ) Numbers are rounded to 100s. 
 All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1 of total employees. 
 Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries have policies, programs, and processes to help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that diversity is important to provide different perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally through its Compensation and Talent Development Committee, oversees these efforts. Southern Company system management utilizes its "Moving to Equity" initiative that focuses on five key areas: talent, work environment, supplier inclusion, civic engagement, and community investment and social justice. This initiative demonstrates the Southern Company system's commitments, highlights key results, and tracks progress on long-term goals. 
 Southern Company system management supports employee resource groups, diversity councils, mentoring programs, and inclusion teams to provide formal networks of colleagues that can help promote belonging, improve employee retention, and support development. At December 31, 2022, people of color and women represented 30 and 26 , respectively, of the Southern Company system's workforce. 
 Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce. Southern Company system management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools, technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The addition of external hires augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the Southern Company system's talent pipeline. 
 The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a comprehensive total rewards strategy with three measurable categories: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries, annual incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare, and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2022, the average age of the Southern Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company system was 15 years.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. The risk factors discussed below could adversely affect a Registrant's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, as well as cause reputational damage. 
 UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS 
 Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal, state, and local governmental regulation, including with respect to rates. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries. 
 Laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Southern Company system offers, protection of critical electric infrastructure assets, transmission planning, reliability, pipeline safety, interaction with wholesale markets, and relationships with affiliates, among other matters. The Registrants' businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if a Registrant is found to be noncompliant. 
 The profitability of the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' businesses is largely dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover their costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their costs, including a reasonable return on invested capital, through their retail rates, which must be approved by the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Such regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required. Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline investments must be approved by the FERC. Changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies' ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority could affect wholesale rates. Also, while a small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through wholesale electric tariffs, the majority are collected through retail rates. Transmission planning could be impacted by FERC policy changes. 
 The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation, the imposition of additional regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for noncompliance with existing laws or regulations could influence the operating environment of the Southern Company system and may result in substantial costs. 
 The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROs are significant. 
 The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, GHGs, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. Compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. The Registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant. 
 The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act and water quality under the Clean Water Act. The EPA and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the disposal and management of CCR at power plant sites. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential compliance methods. The traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically update their ARO cost estimates. 
 Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances could require the Southern Company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and former operating sites, and locations subject to contractual obligations. 
 Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the United States. This litigation has included, but is not 
 I-15 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 limited to, claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO 2 and other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, alleged exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
 Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas. 
 The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals. 
 Concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable assets could further increase. Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant. 
 The Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2022, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO 2 prices starting between 0 and 50 per metric ton of CO 2 emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon. 
 Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. 
 Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions, designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas. 
 Southern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50 reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.

 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions. 
 The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, inability to maintain reliability consistent with customer expectations as the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power transition their generating fleets in support of the Southern Company system's net zero goal, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences. 
 Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage. 
 Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 22 and 27 of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities. 
 Damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance. 
 The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the United States, including facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments. 
 In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs. 
 Transporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. 
 Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties.

 Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate. 
 The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all. These risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system. 
 Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. 
 An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate. 
 The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure. Various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Additionally, these risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. 
 The Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future. 
 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the Registrants. The Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems. 
 Internal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy delivery service failures, compromise sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks. 
 The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern Company Gas' natural gas customers. 
 SCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers. 
 I-18 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 The Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which has the potential to impact, among other things, the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation. The robust growth in supply allowed natural gas prices to moderate and remain below 3 per mmBtu in recent years; however, demand increases beginning in 2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility. The Henry Hub price averaged 6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current forecasts for 2023 are approximately 3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond indicate expectations, absent unforeseen developments, that prices will modestly increase. With the majority of natural gas production being from shale gas formations, any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have a material impact on the supply availability as well as the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to Mexico and those from LNG facilities, has grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's natural gas markets. 
 The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their electric generating capacity. The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers and/or railroads may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase additional coal at higher prices or limit coal generation, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates if deemed to be imprudently incurred. The railroad industry has been experiencing labor shortages, which has led to delays in coal deliveries. As coal-fired generating facilities are retired, the demand for coal is expected to continue to decline. As a result, railroads may commit fewer resources to coal transportation, which could increase these risks. 
 Whereas fuel oil directly provides only a small portion of the Southern Company system's annual generation, its importance to the reliability of the Southern Company system's generation portfolio continues to grow. Over the last few years, related cost increases and supply chain challenges have become more common and may increase the risk of reliability challenges. 
 In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water, which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs. 
 The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related generating capacity. 
 Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs with Southern Power's top three customers comprising approximately 22 of Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The traditional electric operating companies have entered into PPAs with non-affiliated parties for the sale of generating capacity. 
 The revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract. 
 Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If one of these Registrants is unable to replace expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. The failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs. 
 Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries. 
 The traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost. 
 Customers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs. 
 I-19 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 New technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology, which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation. 
 It is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power. 
 Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. 
 If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution facilities could be reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets. 
 The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations. 
 The Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years and challenges competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully-remote work options. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses. 
 Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact operations. 
 The Southern Company system's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment, materials, and other resources. The delivery of components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern Company system's operations has been impacted by ongoing domestic and global supply chain disruptions. International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate global supply chain disruptions. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction, maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments. 
 Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment, and other needed commodities, and these inflationary increases may continue. While inflation in the United States had been relatively low in recent years, its impact became more significant during 2021 and continued in 2022. Uncertainty around inflationary impacts continues to increase in the near-term outlook for economic activity. Rapid inflation or other economic factors may negatively affect the timely recovery of costs. 
 The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue. 
 The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or extended disruptions to capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged reductions in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, new or prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment, and further challenges to the development, construction, and/or operation of the Subsidiary Registrants' facilities, including electric 
 I-20 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 generation, transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and access to funds from financial institutions and capital markets. 
 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein. 
 CONSTRUCTION RISKS 
 The Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals. 
 The businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements, including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for Southern Company Gas. These expenditures also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to certain existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system. The traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing ash ponds to comply with the CCR Rule and, where applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long-term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed. 
 Completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters including, for Plant Vogtle Unit 4, inspections and the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related investigations, reviews, and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational performance; continued challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a result of project delays. 
 If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel construction of a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or abandonment of the construction project. 
 In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority in connection with projects under construction, including rights to change ownership allocations and/or cause the cancellation of a construction project under certain circumstances. Any failure by a partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction. Southern Power participates in partnership agreements with respect to a majority of its renewable energy projects and Georgia Power jointly owns Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with other co-owners. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding other jointly-owned facilities. 
 If construction projects are not completed according to specification, a Registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income. Furthermore, construction delays associated with renewable projects could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives. 
 Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and may not be recoverable through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Southern Company and Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of 3.3 billion 2.4 billion after tax) through December 31, 2022 to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete 
 I-21 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. 
 Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional electric operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related retirement obligations. 
 FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS 
 The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the natural gas operations of Southern Company Gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs. 
 The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy, and/or make electric generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems less competitive. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred. 
 The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants. 
 The consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants. 
 Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction. 
 Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency. 
 Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts. 
 In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects. 
 The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant. 
 Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder. 
 Volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern 
 I-22 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 Power, and the natural gas distribution and underground storage facilities of Southern Company Gas, which is likely to negatively impact revenue. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states that could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities. These volatile weather events may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring procurement of additional power at wholesale prices, or create other grid reliability issues. 
 In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The traditional electric operating companies from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. Additionally, the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs. 
 In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a Subsidiary Registrant's service territory or otherwise affecting its customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs. 
 Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks, including risks not originally contemplated. 
 Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions, dispositions, and investments in the past and may continue to do so. Such actions cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in existing pipelines, most of which are operated by third parties. If one of these agents fails to perform in a proper manner, the value of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of its investment. In addition, Southern Company Gas is required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures. 
 Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk. 
 These transactions also involve risks, including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected funds or return on capital or other anticipated benefits; they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business or operational risks; they may not be successfully integrated into the acquiring company's operations, internal control processes, and/or accounting systems; the due diligence conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks; they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash flow; they may involve retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions that subject Southern Company or its subsidiaries to additional risk; Southern Company or the applicable subsidiary may not be able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions; expected benefits of a transaction may be dependent on the cooperation, performance, or credit risk of a counterparty; minority investments in growth companies may not result in a positive return on investment; or, for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be recoverable. 
 Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to meet their ongoing and future financial obligations. 
 Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own. Substantially all of Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and, for Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service. In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital

 contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock. 
 A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness. 
 There are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company. 
 Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended. 
 The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.

 The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital markets and financial institutions. 
 The Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity for access to low cost money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, continued increases in interest rates, bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility companies, future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Furthermore, some financial institutions may be limited in their ability to provide capital to the Registrants as a result of such financial institution's investment criteria, including criteria related to GHG. 
 Additionally, since a portion of the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's indebtedness bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR, uncertainty related to its announced phase out and alternative reference rates may adversely affect financing costs. Any replacement benchmark rates may be relatively new, fundamentally different from LIBOR, and/or more volatile than other benchmark or market rates. SOFR has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United States, although the SOFR market is not yet fully developed. 
 If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. 
 Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings. 
 The debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. 
 Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning. 
 The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 Shareholder activism could cause Southern Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of Southern Company's business strategy, and impact Southern Company's stock price. 
 Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management's and Southern Company's board's attention and resources. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to Southern Company's future, adversely affect the Southern Company system's relationships with its employees, customers, regulators, or service providers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, Southern Company may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, 
 I-25

 including for third-party advisors. Southern Company's stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks, and uncertainties of any shareholder activism. 
 The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. 
 The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. 
 The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility. 
 Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. 
 See Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of operations. 
 Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount and long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2022, goodwill was 5.2 billion and 5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively. 
 In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the affected Registrant may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. See Notes 1, 7, 9, and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.

 (j) Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50 of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO, an operating public utility company. Alabama Power and Georgia Power are each entitled to one-half of SEGCO's capacity and energy. Alabama Power acts as SEGCO's agent in the operation of SEGCO's units and furnishes fuel to SEGCO for its units. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "SEGCO" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Environmental Accounting Order," "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans," and "Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity included in the table above. 
 Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants and other important units of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. 
 Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC. The line extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC is paying a use fee through 2024 covering all expenses and the amortization of the original cost. At December 31, 2022, the unamortized portion was approximately 1 million. 
 Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine that was intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the operator of the mine, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters Mississippi Power Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 In conjunction with Southern Company's 2019 sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and NextEra Energy agreed to negotiate a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. On July 12, 2022, the co-owners executed a revised operating agreement. The dispatch procedures in the revised operating agreement for the two jointly-owned coal units at Plant Daniel resulted in Mississippi Power designating one of the two units as primary and the other as secondary in lieu of each company separately owning 100 of a single generating unit. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase its co-owner's ownership interest for 1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. See Notes 2 and 3 under "Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plan" and "Other Matters Mississippi Power Plant Daniel," respectively, in Item 8 herein for additional information on Plant Daniel. 
 In 2022, the maximum demand on the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO was 37,035,000 KWs and occurred on June 15, 2022, which was also the maximum all-time demand. This amount excludes demand served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The reserve margin for the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO in 2022 was 20 .

The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 Distribution and Transmission Mains 
 Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 77,591 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use. 
 Storage Assets 
 Gas Distribution Operations 
 Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50 of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40 of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements. 
 Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.

 On September 7, 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas. The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022 and completion of the sale of the California facility is expected later in 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 
 Jointly-Owned Properties 
 Southern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments segment has a 50 undivided ownership interest in a 115-mile pipeline facility in northwest Georgia that was placed in service in 2017. Southern Company Gas also has an agreement to lease its 50 undivided ownership in the pipeline facility.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 OVERVIEW 
 Business Activities 
 Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 The traditional electric operating companies Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast. 
 Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities. 
 Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and one non-reportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly. 
 See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Alabama Power 
 On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved the following items: 
 Alabama Power's petition for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and the related costs are being recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, which reflected an increase in annual revenues of 34 million, or 0.6 , effective with November 2022 billings. 
 An increase to Rate ECR effective with August 2022 billings, which resulted in an increase of approximately 310 million annually. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact the related operating cash flows. 
 Modifications to Rate NDR. 
 An accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds 35 million. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued 166 million to the reserve.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 On September 23, 2022, the FERC authorized Alabama Power to use updated depreciation rates from its 2021 depreciation study effective January 2023. The updated depreciation rates are expected to result in an approximately 500 million increase in annual depreciation expense. 
 On November 1, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR of approximately 500 million annually effective with December 2022 billings. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery. 
 On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations for Rate CNP Compliance for 2023 which resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately 255 million, or 3.7 , effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates. 
 On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase of approximately 318 million, or 4.6 , effective with January 2023 billings. In addition, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately 318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the Rate CNP Depreciation increase. The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in service in November 2023. At December 31, 2022, associated project expenditures totaled approximately 518 million. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15 , resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of 62 million. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information. 
 
 Georgia Power 
 Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status 
 Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power currently holds a 45.7 ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024, respectively, is 10.6 billion. 
 On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023, during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain equipment and component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now projected to be placed in service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases. 
 During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling 307 million were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost forecast by 125 million to replenish construction contingency and 9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of 36 million 27 million after tax), 32 million 24 million after tax), and 148 million 110 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Regulatory Matters." 
 Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Joint Owner Contracts"). The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. 
 On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is 17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. On July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is 18.38 billion and that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits. 
 On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately 92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20 of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. On October 4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of settlement and voluntary dismissal of the pending litigation described above, including Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022, Dalton dismissed its related complaint. Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of approximately 440 million 328 million after tax), 16 million 12 million after tax), (102) million (76) million after tax), and 53 million 40 million after tax), respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of 407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately 345 million associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast. 
 Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7 . Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100 of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service. 
 The ultimate impact of these matters on the construction schedule and project capital cost forecast and related cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. 
 2022 ARP 
 On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, including estimated net rate increases totaling 216 million, 377 million, and 403 million effective January 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, respectively. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Rate Plans 2022 ARP" for additional information. 
 Integrated Resource Plans 
 On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the 2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved several requests, including the following: 
 Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5 ownership), which occurred on August 31, 2022, and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75 ownership) by December 31, 2028, as well as the

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 reclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values of these units and any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventories upon retirement. 
 Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50 ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "SEGCO" for additional information. 
 Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its ash ponds and landfills. 
 The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to the 2025 IRP. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information. 
 
 Mississippi Power 
 On June 7, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2022, resulting in an annual increase in revenues of approximately 18 million, or 1.9 , effective with the first billing cycle of April 2022. 
 On August 26, 2022, the FERC accepted an amended shared service agreement (SSA) between Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5 annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving approximately 400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide 100 of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA. Mississippi Power expects to remarket this capacity, including the potential development of future arrangements with Cooperative Energy. 
 On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a 23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff . Cooperative Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 On November 15, 2022 , Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by 25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional 25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel recovery balance. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability reserve for the purpose of deferring generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future year, under certain conditions. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued 25 million to the reliability reserve. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information. 
 
 Southern Power 
 During 2022, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the remaining 40 MWs of the Tranquillity battery energy storage facility (72 MWs total) and the remaining 15 MWs of the Garland battery energy storage facility (88 MWs total). 
 Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2022 was 96 through 2027 and 90 through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years.

 Key Performance Indicators 
 In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.8 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS "Southern Company Gas Operating Metrics" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. 
 The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Rate RSE" and "Mississippi Power Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return. 
 Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Southern Company 
 
 Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was 3.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 1.1 billion, or 47.3 , from 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter 2022, and sales growth, and increases in natural gas revenues from base rate increases and continued infrastructure replacement, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and higher interest expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. 
 Basic EPS was 3.28 in 2022 and 2.26 in 2021. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was 3.26 in 2022 and 2.24 in 2021. EPS for 2022 and 2021 was negatively impacted by 0.04 and 0.01 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock Southern Company" for additional information. 
 
 Dividends paid per share of common stock were 2.70 in 2022 and 2.62 in 2021. In January 2023, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 68 cents per share. For 2022, the dividend payout ratio was 82 compared to 116 for 2021.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Electric Operating Revenues 
 Electric operating revenues for 2022 were 22.9 billion, reflecting a 4.6 billion, or 25.0 , increase from 2021. Details of electric operating revenues were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Retail electric prior year 14,852 Estimated change resulting from Rates and pricing 451 Sales growth 165 Weather 244 Fuel and other cost recovery 2,485 Retail electric current year 18,197 14,852 Wholesale electric revenues 3,641 2,455 Other electric revenues 747 718 Other revenues 288 275 Electric operating revenues 22,873 18,300 
 Retail electric revenues increased 3.3 billion, or 22.5 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2022 was primarily due to increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage. In addition, Alabama Power made a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021. These increases were partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022. 
 Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" for additional information. Also see "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather. 
 Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Capacity and other 625 550 Energy 3,016 1,905 Total 3,641 2,455 
 In 2022, wholesale electric revenues increased 1.2 billion, or 48.3 , as compared to 2021 due to increases of 1.1 billion in energy revenues and 75 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues increased 744 million at Southern Power primarily due to fuel and purchased power increases compared to 2021 and an increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily associated with natural gas PPAs. Energy revenues increased 367 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in natural gas PPAs at Southern Power and increased opportunity sales at Alabama Power due to warmer weather. 
 Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are 
 II-9

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy. 
 Other Electric Revenues 
 Other electric revenues increased 29 million, or 4.0 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 54 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, 18 million in outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, 13 million in cogeneration steam revenues associated with higher natural gas prices at Alabama Power, and 11 million in rent revenues at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a decrease of 32 million resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of 18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and a decrease of 17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers, all at Georgia Power. 
 Energy Sales 
 Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows: 
 2022 Total KWHs Total KWH Percent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change ) 
 (in billions) Residential 49.6 4.8 0.2 Commercial 48.3 3.5 2.0 Industrial 49.5 1.5 1.5 Other 0.6 (4.8) (4.8) Total retail 148.0 3.2 1.2 Wholesale 56.3 12.6 Total energy sales 204.3 5.6 
 ) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans. 
 Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales increased 1.8 billion KWHs in 2022 as compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.2 and 2.0 , respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 largely due to customer growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.5 in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in the pipeline and paper sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the chemicals sector. 
 See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues increased 13 million, or 4.7 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 10 million in unregulated lighting sales at Alabama Power and 7 million associated with energy conservation projects at Georgia Power.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market. 
 Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows: 
 2022 2021 Total generation (in billions of KWHs) (a) 
 186 179 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs) 
 25 18 Sources of generation (percent) 
 Gas 51 48 Coal 22 22 Nuclear 16 18 Hydro 3 4 Wind, Solar, and Other 8 8 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 
 Gas (a) 
 5.29 3.07 Coal 3.67 2.85 Nuclear 0.72 0.75 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) (a) 
 4.05 2.55 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) (b) 
 7.66 5.85 
 (a) Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information. 
 (b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
 In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses were 8.4 billion, an increase of 3.4 billion, or 69.0 , as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a 2.8 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a 653 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income. 
 Fuel 
 In 2022, fuel expense was 6.8 billion, an increase of 2.8 billion, or 70.4 , as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 72.3 increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 28.8 increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, an 11.1 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, and a 9.0 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. 
 Purchased Power 
 In 2022, purchased power expense was 1.6 billion, an increase of 615 million, or 62.9 , as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 38.2 increase in the volume of KWHs purchased and a 30.9 increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices. 
 Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased 459 million, or 9.5 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with increases of 247 million in transmission and distribution expenses, 95 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled outage and maintenance costs, 25 million for a reliability reserve accrual in 2022 at Mississippi 
 II-11 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Power, and 22 million in amortization of cloud software. The transmission and distribution increase was primarily due to increased line maintenance, as well as the net impact of Alabama Power accruals of 166 million to the reliability reserve in 2022 and an incremental 65 million to the NDR in 2021. See Note 1 to the financial statements under " Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves" for additional information. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 76 million, or 2.6 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional plant in service. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 63 million, or 5.9 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in municipal franchise fees associated with higher retail revenues at Georgia Power. 
 Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 
 Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling 183 million and 1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. 
 Gain on Dispositions, Net 
 Gain on dispositions, net decreased 20 million, or 33.9 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a net decrease of 39 million in gains at Southern Power related to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, partially offset by 17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets at Georgia Power in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information. 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 31 million, or 17.3 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction at Alabama Power and an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 99 million, or 10.2 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately 54 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and 43 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased 89 million, or 20.8 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a 68 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and a 23 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a 33 million increase in charitable donations at the traditional electric operating companies. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes increased 629 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Substantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 8 million, or 8.1 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to 28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by 23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.

 Gas Business 
 Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and gas marketing services. 
 A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: 
 2022 Increase (Decrease) from 2021 (in millions) Operating revenues 5,962 1,582 Cost of natural gas 3,004 1,385 Other operations and maintenance 1,176 104 Depreciation and amortization 559 23 Taxes other than income taxes 282 57 Impairment charges 131 131 Gain on dispositions, net (4) 123 Total operating expenses 5,148 1,823 Operating income 814 (241) Earnings from equity method investments 148 98 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 263 25 Other income (expense), net 53 106 Income taxes 180 (95) Net income 572 33 
 Seasonality of Results 
 During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services' operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2022, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 67 and 66 , respectively. For 2021, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 70 and 102 , respectively.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues in 2022 were 6.0 billion, reflecting a 1.6 billion, or 36.1 , increase compared to 2021. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 
 2022 (in millions) Operating revenues prior year 4,380 Estimated change resulting from Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 252 Gas costs and other cost recovery 1,468 Gas marketing services 15 Wholesale gas services (187) Other 34 Operating revenues current year 5,962 
 Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and Chattanooga Gas and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information. 
 The change in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services was due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial. 
 Cost of Natural Gas 
 Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Natural Gas Cost Recovery " for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 87.5 of the total cost of natural gas for 2022. 
 Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives. 
 Cost of natural gas was 3.0 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion, or 85.5 , in 2022 compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0 increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021. 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased 104 million, or 9.7 , in 2022 compared to 2021. Excluding 66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately 174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of 64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, 43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at the natural gas distribution utilities, 31 million primarily related to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and 18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 23 million, or 4.3 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxe s increased 57 million, or 25.3 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 39 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an 11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income. 
 Impairment Charges 
 In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately 131 million 99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Gain on Dispositions, Net 
 In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a 121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Earnings from Equity Method Investments 
 Earnings from equity method investments increased 98 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling 84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 25 million, or 10.5 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately 16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and 8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased 106 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling 101 million in 2021 and an increase of 10 million primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes decreased 95 million, or 34.5 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of 110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and 32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by 17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Business Activities 
 Southern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.

 Alabama Power 
 Alabama Power's 2022 net income after dividends on preferred stock was 1.34 billion, representing a 102 million, or 8.2 , increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in Alabama Power's service territory in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth. Also contributing to the increase in net income were increases in other operating revenues associated with transmission revenues and unregulated lighting sales, as well as an increase in AFUDC, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs associated with a reliability reserve accrual and higher interest expense. 
 A condensed income statement for Alabama Power follows:

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Retail revenues increased 971 million, or 17.7 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fuel and other cost recovery, as well as an increase in revenue driven by a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth in all major retail classes. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Rate ECR," " Rate RSE," and " Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information. See "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and weather. 
 Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Capacity and other 213 173 Energy 513 204 Total non-affiliated 726 377 
 In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased 349 million, or 92.6 , as compared to 2021 due to a 309 million increase in energy revenues primarily related to higher natural gas prices and a 40 million increase in capacity revenues primarily related to increased opportunity sales due to warmer weather in 2022 as compared to 2021. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy. 
 In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased 31 million, or 18.1 , as compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflects a 64.7 increase in the price of energy due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 28.1 decrease in KWH sales due to the availability of lower cost Southern Company system resources compared to Alabama Power's generation. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. 
 In 2022, other operating revenues increased 53 million, or 14.5 , as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of 19 million in transmission revenues primarily due to open access transmission tariff sales, 13 million in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices, 10 million in unregulated lighting sales, and 9 million in rent revenues.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Energy Sales 
 Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows: 
 2022 Total KWHs Total KWH Percent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change( (in billions) Residential 18.4 5.4 0.1 Commercial 13.1 2.6 0.1 Industrial 20.9 0.5 0.5 Other 0.1 (10.1) (10.1) Total retail 52.5 2.7 0.2 Wholesale Non-affiliates 12.7 29.1 Affiliates 3.7 (28.1) Total wholesale 16.4 9.3 Total energy sales 68.9 4.2 
 ) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans. 
 Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. In 2022, weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales were flat compared to 2021. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.5 as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the forest product and pipeline sectors. 
 See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales. 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

 (a) Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information. 
 (b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
 Fuel and purchased power expenses were 2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 1.0 billion, or 64.8 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 648 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a 390 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Rate ECR" for additional information. 
 Fuel 
 Fuel expense was 1.8 billion in 2022, an increase of 605 million, or 49.0 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 77.2 increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 22.4 increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, a 24.1 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and a 9.7 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 13.3 decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear as a result of the extension of a planned outage. 
 Purchased Power Non-Affiliates 
 Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was 441 million in 2022, an increase of 220 million, or 99.5 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 90.8 increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 10.3 increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices. 
 Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
 Purchased Power Affiliates 
 Purchased power expense from affiliates was 360 million in 2022, an increase of 213 million, or 144.9 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 58.3 increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 54.4 increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices. 
 II-20 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased 200 million, or 11.5 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 147 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily associated with a 166 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022, partially offset by an incremental 65 million NDR accrual in 2021, as well as other line maintenance, 33 million in generation expenses primarily associated with maintenance and Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, and 17 million in customer accounts, customer service, and sales expenses primarily associated with labor and bad debt expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and " Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 16 million, or 1.9 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of 28 million in depreciation related to an increase in additional plant in service, largely offset by a decrease of 16 million in amortization of regulatory assets associated with the retirement of certain generating plants. 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 18 million, or 34.6 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction, as well as an increase in capital expenditures related to hydro production. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 42 million, or 12.4 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately 36 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and 12 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased 37 million, or 34.6 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in interest income and non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes increased 51 million, or 13.7 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease in state tax credits. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Georgia Power 
 
 Georgia Power's 2022 net income was 1.8 billion, representing a 1.2 billion, or 210.4 , increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a 1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as well as an increase in retail revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather in Georgia Power's service territory compared to 2021, and sales growth. These increases were partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues for 2022 were 11.6 billion, reflecting a 2.3 billion, or 25.1 , increase from 2021. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Retail prior year 8,478 Estimated change resulting from Rates and pricing 288 Sales growth 109 Weather 130 Fuel cost recovery 1,787 Retail current year 10,792 8,478 Wholesale revenues 235 197 Other operating revenues 557 585 Total operating revenues 11,584 9,260 
 Retail revenues increased 2.3 billion, or 27.3 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage, partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Rate Plans 2019 ARP" for additional information. 
 See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in 2022. 
 Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.

 Wholesale revenues from power sales were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Capacity and other 48 63 Energy 187 134 Total 235 197 
 In 2022, wholesale revenues increased 38 million, or 19.3 , as compared to 2021 largely due to an increase of 78 million related to the average cost of fuel primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices, partially offset by a 27 million decrease in KWH sales associated with lower market demand and a 10 million decrease in capacity revenues due to the expiration of a non-affiliate PPA in 2021. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. 
 In 2022, other operating revenues decreased 28 million, or 4.8 , as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of 32 million resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of 18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and decreases of 17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers and 16 million from power delivery construction and maintenance contracts. These reductions were largely offset by increases of 27 million associated with unregulated outdoor lighting sales and energy conservation projects, 20 million in open access transmission tariff sales, and 4 million from maintenance services provided to integrated transmission system owners. 
 Energy Sales 
 Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows: 
 2022 Total KWHs Total KWH Percent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change )

 ) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans. 
 Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales increased 0.4 and 2.9 , respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to customer

 growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 2.4 primarily due to increases in the pipeline, lumber, paper, and electronic sectors, partially offset by decreases in the textiles and chemicals sectors. 
 See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market. 
 Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 
 2022 2021 Total generation (in billions of KWHs)

 7.88 5.07 
 ) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
 Fuel and purchase d power expenses were 4.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 1.8 billion, or 61.3 , compared to 2021. The increase was due to an increase of 1.7 billion related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of 148 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information. 
 Fuel 
 Fuel expense was 2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 1.0 billion, or 71.6 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 65.9 and 37.8 in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas and coal, respectively, and a 10.8 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal. 
 Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates 
 Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was 856 million in 2022, an increase of 224 million, or 35.4 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 26.5 in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices and an increase of 25.4 in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to higher demand. 
 Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Purchased Power - Affiliates 
 Purchased power expense from affiliates was 1.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 542 million, or 63.1 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 75.3 in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices. 
 Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased 136 million, or 6.1 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 96 million in distribution expenses primarily associated with line maintenance, 45 million in certain compensation and benefit expenses, 11 million in amortization of cloud software, and 9 million in maintenance costs at corporate and field support facilities, partially offset by 17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets, a decrease of 15 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled generation outages partially offset by environmental projects, and a 12 million reduction in billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners largely resulting from a terminated transmission service agreement. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 59 million, or 4.3 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of 46 million associated with additional plant in service and 12 million associated with amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" and " Rate Plans 2019 ARP" for additional information. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 51 million, or 10.7 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in municipal franchise fees resulting from higher retail revenues. 
 Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 
 Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling 183 million and 1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect revisions to the total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 13 million, or 10.2 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 64 million, or 15.2 , in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects approximately 39 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and 24 million related to higher interest rates. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased 34 million, or 23.9 , in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. 
 Income Taxes (Benefit) 
 In 2022, income tax expense was 370 million compared to income tax benefit of 168 million for 2021, a change of 538 million. The change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

 Mississippi Power 
 Mississippi Power's net income was 164 million in 2022 compared to 159 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues, largely offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance costs. 
 A condensed income statement for Mississippi Power follows: 
 2022 Increase 
 (Decrease) 
 from 2021 
 (in millions) Operating revenues 1,694 372 Fuel and purchased power 789 293 Other operations and maintenance 376 63 Depreciation and amortization 181 1 Taxes other than income taxes 124 (4) Total operating expenses 1,470 353 Operating income 224 19 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 56 (4) Other income (expense), net 33 (2) Income taxes 37 16 Net income 164 5 
 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues for 2022 were 1.7 billion, reflecting a 372 million, or 28.1 , increase f rom 2021. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Retail prior year 875 Estimated change resulting from Rates and pricing 24 Sales growth 4 Weather 13 Fuel and other cost recovery 19 Retail current year 935 875 Wholesale revenues Non-affiliates 252 230 Affiliates 460 188 Total wholesale revenues 712 418 Other operating revenues 47 29 Total operating revenues 1,694 1,322 
 Total retail revenues for 2022 increased 60 million, or 6.9 , compared to 2021 primarily due t o an increase in revenues in accordance with new PEP rates that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2022, an increase in fuel and other cost recovery revenues primarily as a result of higher recoverable fuel costs, and an increase in customer usage. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information. 
 See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather. 
 Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power

 expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information. 
 Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows: 
 2022 2021 (in millions) Capacity and other 3 3 Energy 249 227 Total non-affiliated 252 230 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased 22 million, or 9.6 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs and an increase in base revenue from MRA customers primarily due to increased demand as a result of weather impacts in 2022. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4 of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022 . Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff" for additional information. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased 272 million, or 144.7 , i n 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 243 million associated with higher fuel costs, primarily for natural gas, and 29 million associated with higher KWH sales due to lower cost available Mississippi Power resources as compared to the available affiliate company generation. 
 Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. 
 In 2022, other operating revenues increased 18 million, or 62.1 , as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of 13 million in unregulated sales associated with power delivery construction and maintenance projects and 4 million in open access transmission tariff revenues. 
 II-27

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Energy Sales 
 Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows: 
 2022 Total KWHs Total KWH Percent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change ) 
 (in millions) Residential 2,134 4.2 (1.8) Commercial 2,632 2.9 1.4 Industrial 4,686 1.6 1.6 Other 31 (8.8) (8.8) Total retail 9,483 2.5 0.7 Wholesale Non-affiliated 3,465 (4.0) Affiliated 5,489 15.8 Total wholesale 8,954 7.2 Total energy sales 18,437 4.7 
 ) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Mississippi Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans. 
 Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.8 compared to 2021 due to a decrease in customer usage resulting from increased activity outside the home as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 1.4 primarily due to customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.6 primarily due to increases in the petroleum, pipeline, and transportation sectors. 
 See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies. 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market. 
 Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 
 2022 2021 Total generation (in millions of KWHs) 
 18,303 17,377 Total purchased power (in millions of KWHs) 
 617 675 Sources of generation (percent) 
 Gas 90 92 Coal 10 8 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 
 Gas 4.34 2.85 Coal 4.13 3.24 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 
 4.31 2.88 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 
 6.91 3.90 
 Fuel and purchased power expenses were 789 million in 2022, an increase of 293 million, or 59.1 , as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 266 million increase related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a 27 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
 II-28 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Fuel Cost Recovery" and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information. 
 Fuel expense increased 276 million, or 58.8 , in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 52.3 increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 29.1 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 27.5 increase in the average cost of coal per KWHs generated, and a 3.9 increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. 
 Purchased power expense increased 16 million , or 62.0 , in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 77.2 increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, partially offset by an 8.6 decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased. 
 Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased 63 million, or 20.1 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase wa s primarily due to a 25 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022 and increases of 12 million related to unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects, 7 million associated with storm reserve accruals, 6 million in employee compensation and benefits, 4 million in transmission and distribution line maintenance, and 4 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility primarily related to sales and use taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power System Restoration Rider" and " Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters Mississippi Power" for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes increased 16 million, or 76.2 , in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of 11 million in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective in April 2022, as well as an increase of 5 million due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power Performance Evaluation Plan" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Southern Power 
 
 Net income attributable to Southern Power for 2022 was 354 million, an 88 million increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher market prices of energy and new natural gas PPAs and higher income associated with tax equity partnerships, partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses, gains from contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, and a tax benefit due to a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in 2021. 
 
 A condensed statement of income follows: 
 2022 Increase 
 (Decrease) 
 from 2021 
 (in millions) Operating revenues 3,369 1,153 Fuel 1,614 812 Purchased power 311 172 Other operations and maintenance 482 59 Depreciation and amortization 516 (1) Taxes other than income taxes 49 4 Loss on sales-type leases 1 (39) Gain on dispositions, net (2) 39 Total operating expenses 2,971 1,046 Operating income 398 107 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 138 (9) Other income (expense), net 7 (3) Income taxes (benefit) 20 33 Net income 247 80 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (107) (8) Net income attributable to Southern Power 354 88 
 Operating Revenues 
 Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool. 
 Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue 
 Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. 
 Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are generally accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. 
 Solar and Wind Energy Revenue 
 Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs. 
 Operating Revenues Details 
 Details of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows: 2022 2021 (in millions) PPA capacity revenues 451 408 PPA energy revenues 2,121 1,311 Total PPA revenues 2,572 1,719 Non-PPA revenues 761 467 Other revenues 36 30 Total operating revenues 3,369 2,216 
 Operating revenues for 2022 were 3.4 billion, a 1.2 billion, or 52.0 increase from 2021. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following: 
 PPA capacity revenues increased 43 million, or 10.5 , primarily due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs. 
 PPA energy revenues increased 810 million, or 61.8 , primarily due to a 656 million increase in sales under existing natural gas PPAs resulting from a 539 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a 117 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold. Also contributing to the increase was a 164 million increase in sales associated with new natural gas PPAs, net of contractual expirations. 
 Non-PPA revenues increased 294 million, or 63.0 , due to a 338 million increase in the market price of energy, partially offset by a 42 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
 Details of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 
 Total KWHs Total KWH Change Total KWHs 2022 2021 (in billions of KWHs) Generation 48 44 Purchased power 3 3 Total generation and purchased power 51 8.5 47 Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar, wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements) 
 31 10.7 28 
 Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power. 
 Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows: 2022 2021 (in millions) Fuel 1,614 802 Purchased power 311 139 Total fuel and purchased power expenses 1,925 941 
 In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased 984 million, or 104.6 , compared to 2021. Fuel expense increased 812 million, or 101.2 , primarily due to a 719 million increase associated with the average cost of fuel and a 93 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense increased 172 million, or 123.7 , largely due to a 168 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 In 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased 59 million, or 14.0 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 42 million related to generation maintenance and outage expenses and 10 million in transmission expenses to serve new natural gas PPAs, partially offset by 6 million related to the allocation in 2021 of uncollected settlements by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri. 
 Loss on Sales-Type Leases 
 In 2021, a 40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities' PPAs, 26 million of which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information. 
 Gain on Dispositions, Net 
 In 2022, gain on dispositions, net decreased 39 million, or 95.1 , compared to 2021 primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information. 
 Income Taxes (Benefit) 
 In 2022, income tax expense was 20 million compared to income tax benefit of 13 million for 2021, a change of 33 million. The change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2022 and a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in the first quarter 2021, partially offset by higher wind PTCs in 2022. See Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements under "Income Taxes" and "Effective Tax Rate," respectively, for additional information. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 In 2022, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 8 million, or 8.1 , compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to 28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by 23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information. 
 
 Southern Company Gas 
 Operating Metrics 
 Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. 
 Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. 
 The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. 
 II-32 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers. 
 Seasonality of Results 
 During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below. 
 Percent Generated During Heating Season Operating Revenues Net Income 2022 67 66 2021 70 102 
 Net Income 
 Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2022 was 572 million, an increase of 33 million, or 6.1 , compared to 2021. Net income increased 88 million at gas pipeline investments primarily as a result of a 2021 impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and 58 million at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement, largely offset by after-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling 99 million related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities. The 2021 results also included 107 million of net income from Sequent, including a 92 million after-tax gain and 85 million of additional tax expense resulting from its July 1, 2021 sale. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

 Operating Revenues 
 Operating rev enues in 2022 were 6.0 billion, reflecting a 1.6 billion, or 36.1 , increase compared to 2021. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 
 2022 (in millions) Operating revenues prior year 4,380 Estimated change resulting from Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 252 Gas costs and other cost recovery 1,468 Gas marketing services 15 Wholesale gas services (187) Other 34 Operating revenues current year 5,962 
 Revenues at the natural gas distributio n ut ilities increased in 2022 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and Chattanooga Gas and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost rec overy increased in 2022 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from cu stomer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered t hrough natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information. 
 The changes in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services were due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Heating Degree Days 
 Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather changes. Southern Company Gas also uses hedges for the majority of any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services; therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

 Customer Count 
 The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 2022 2021 (in thousands, except market share Gas distribution operations 4,358 4,337 Gas marketing services Energy customers ) 
 622 603 Market share of energy customers in Georgia 29.3 28.7 
 ) Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. 
 Southern Company Gas anticipates customer growth and uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 
 Cost of Natural Gas 
 Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Natural Gas Cost Recovery " for additional information. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations r epr esented 87.5 of the total cost of natural gas for 2022. 
 Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives. 
 I n 2022, cost of natur al gas was 3.0 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion, or 85.5 , compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0 increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021. 
 Volumes of Natural Gas Sold 
 The following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.

 Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 In 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased 104 million, or 9.7 , compared to 2021. Excluding 66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately 174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of 64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, 43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at gas distribution operations, 31 million primarily related to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and 18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Depreciation and Amortization 
 In 2022, depreciation and amortization increased 23 million, or 4.3 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 In 2022, taxes other than income taxe s increased 57 million, or 25.3 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 39 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an 11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income. 
 Impairment Charges 
 In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately 131 million 99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Gain on Dispositions, Net 
 In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a 121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. Se e Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Earnings from Equity Method Investments 
 In 2022, earnings from equity method investments increased 98 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling 84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 
 In 2022, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 25 million, or 10.5 , compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately 16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and 8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 In 2022, other income (expense), n et increased 106 million compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling 101 million in 2021 and an increase of 10 million at gas distribution operations primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 In 2022, income taxes decreased 95 million, or 34.5 , compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of 110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and 32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by 17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

 ) As a result of the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was no longer a reportable segment in 2022. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Gas Distribution Operations 
 Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. 
 With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 In 2022, net income increased 58 million, or 14.1 , compared to 2021. Operating revenues increased 1.6 billion primarily due to higher gas cost recovery, rate increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses increased 1.5 billion primarily due to a 1.2 billion increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices compared to 2021, a 52 million increase in compensation and benefit expenses, and a 34 million increase in depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service. The increase in operating expenses also includes increases of 83 million in costs passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt expenses and revenue taxes. Other income and expense increased 10 million primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased 22 million primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments. Income taxes increased 25 million primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Gas Pipeline Investments 
 Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, Dalton Pipeline, and PennEast Pipeline. In 2022, net income increased 88 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling 84 million 67 million after tax) related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 Gas Marketing Services 
 Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing

 services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk m anagement tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts. 
 In 2022, net income increased 6 million, or 6.8 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 163 million increase in operating revenues as a result of higher commodity prices, colder weather, and higher sales to commercial customers, partially offset by a 155 million increase in operating expenses primarily due to 149 million in higher cost of natural gas and an increase of 3 million in income taxes as a result of higher pre-tax earnings. 
 All Other 
 All other includes natural gas storage businesses, a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding agreements by certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas to sell two natural gas storage facilities. 
 In 2022, net income decreased 12 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling approximately 131 million 99 million after tax) related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities, largely offset by 84 million of additional tax expense as a result of the sale of Sequent in 2021, an increase in operating revenues of 17 million primarily related to higher demand fees and favorable hedge gains at the natural gas storage businesses and higher sales from the renewable natural gas business, lower depreciation in 2022, and an increase in charitable contributions in 2022. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information. 
 
 FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
 General 
 Prices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution service provided by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Utility Regulation" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters. 
 Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein. 
 For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor. 
 Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. 
 Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a global and national economic recession in 2020 and have been further impacted by the invasion of Ukraine and significant declines in labor force participation rates. The confluence of these disruptions has resulted in the highest levels of inflation globally in 40 years and driven a significant policy response by central banks across the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has increased policy interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years and to levels high enough to slow economic activity. These actions and impacts, including increased costs for goods and services and borrowing costs, have led to a significantly increased risk of recession. Additionally, inflation remains elevated in part due to continued supply chain constraints and labor markets remaining tight. Electricity sales across all classes have recovered to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and 
 II-38

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 customer growth at both the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities has remained strong. However, weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing to declining energy sales. Additionally, the current economic environment has increased the uncertainty of future energy demand and operating costs. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2022. 
 The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See "Income Tax Matters" herein for information regarding recent tax legislation expanding the availability of federal ITCs and PTCs. Also see Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential across certain parts of the U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and have resulted in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. 
 Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. 
 Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4 of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. 
 As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and 
 II-39 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and/or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. 
 Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty for some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time. 
 Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas. 
 Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital expenditures through 2027 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows: 
 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Total (in millions) Southern Company 139 125 108 91 50 513 Alabama Power 53 35 46 28 18 180 Georgia Power 82 86 56 53 24 301 Mississippi Power 5 3 7 11 7 33 
 These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See "Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Cash Requirements" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.

 Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 Air Quality 
 Since 1990, the Southern Company system reduced SO 2 and NO X air emissions by 99 and 92 , respectively, through 2021. Since 2005, the Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by 97 through 2021. 
 On March 11, 2022, the EPA released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan to require reductions in NO X emissions from sources in 26 states, including Alabama and Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their interstate transport (good neighbor) obligations under the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in downwind states. Georgia and North Carolina have approved interstate transport state implementation plans related to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to this rule. The EPA is anticipated to issue a final rule by March 2023 with initial applicability for 2023. The ultimate impact of a final rule cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in increased compliance costs. 
 Water Quality 
 In 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program and provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, in October 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these subcategories. 
 Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition on September 30, 2022, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024 subject to certain operating conditions. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" and "SEGCO," respectively, for additional information. 
 The remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately 1.4 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2022. The net book value of 42 million for retired coal equipment at Plant Barry Unit 4 was reclassified to a regulatory asset at December 31, 2022. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Rate CNP Compliance" and " Environmental Accounting Order" for additional information. 
 Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5 ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75 ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power also submitted a NOPP indicating plans to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4 ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD. 
 The Georgia PSC approved the retirements of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (which occurred on August 31, 2022) and Plant Scherer Unit 3 in its 2022 IRP order, but deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 to the 2025 IRP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information. 
 II-41 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule, referred to as the ELG Supplemental Rule, is expected to be released by mid-2023. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals 
 In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program, which has broader applicability than the federal rule. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program. 
 The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. Beginning on January 11, 2022, the EPA has issued numerous Part A determinations that state its current positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements, such as criteria for groundwater corrective action and CCR unit closure. The traditional electric operating companies are working with state regulatory agencies to determine whether the EPA's current positions may impact closure and groundwater monitoring plans. 
 On April 8, 2022, the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group and a group of generating facility operators filed petitions for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging whether the EPA's January 11, 2022 actions establish new legislative rules that should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking. A decision by the court is expected in late 2023. The ultimate impacts of the EPA's current positions are subject to the outcome of the pending litigation and any potential future rulemaking and cannot be determined at this time. 
 Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Cash Requirements," Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Rate Plans" and "General Litigation Matters Alabama Power," respectively, and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Environmental Remediation 
 The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" for additional information. 
 Global Climate Issues 
 In 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which repealed and replaced the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and would have required states to develop unit-specific CO 2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion limiting the EPA's authority 
 II-42 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act with a focus on whether such authority allows the EPA to regulate the electric industry in a manner as broad as the CPP. The EPA has announced its intent to propose a new rule for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and to propose revised performance standards for new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units pursuant to the Clean Air Act by April 2023. The ultimate impact of these actions cannot be determined at this time. 
 In February 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. In April 2021, President Biden announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50 to 52 reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement. 
 Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70 coal and 15 natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22 coal and 51 natural gas in 2022. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 6,700 MWs of coal-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,700 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, the Southern Company system's capacity mix consists of over 11,500 MWs of renewable and storage facilities through ownership and long-term PPAs. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations Water Quality" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998. 
 The following table provides the Registrants' 2021 and preliminary 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:

 ) Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50 reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2022 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 46 since 2007. GHG emissions increased in 2022 due to an increase in generation when compared to 2021 resulting from increased electricity sales, as discussed further under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS "Southern Company Electricity Business" herein. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50 as early as 2025. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; implement initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution operational emissions; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.

 Regulatory Matters 
 See OVERVIEW "Recent Developments" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. 
 
 Construction Programs 
 The Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. 
 For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. 
 See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities. 
 Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program. 
 See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years. 
 
 Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements 
 General 
 Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms. 
 Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. 
 Southern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2022, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,175 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next eight years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth. 
 Natural Gas 
 Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. 
 As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern 
 II-44 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility. 
 Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional information. 
 Solar and Wind 
 Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits. 
 
 Income Tax Matters 
 Consolidated Income Taxes 
 The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting for Income Taxes" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Tax Credits 
 Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power. 
 Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately 1.1 billion and 0.8 billion, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2026, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Income Taxes" and Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Tax Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences. 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and PTCs for clean energy projects, allows PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the transferability of the tax credits. The IRA extends and increases the tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and nuclear projects. Additional ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy communities. The IRA also enacted a 15 corporate minimum tax on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs and tax depreciation. The 15 corporate minimum tax on book income can be reduced by energy tax credits. 
 For solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30 ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30 ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100 PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects placed in service before 2022, the 2022 PTC rate is 2.6 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022, the 2022 PTC rate 
 II-45 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 is 2.75 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. 
 Implementation of the IRA provisions is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS, and the ultimate impacts cannot be determined at this time; however, the IRA is not expected to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 
 General Litigation and Other Matters 
 The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential. 
 
 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors. 
 
 Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they would on a non-regulated company. 
 Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2022 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 88 for Southern Company, 98 for Alabama Power, 97 for Georgia Power, 99 for Mississippi Power, and 88 for Southern Company Gas. 
 As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable Registrants. 
 
 Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 
 (Southern Company and Georgia Power) 
 In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost 
 II-46 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the 3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the 0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to 5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above 5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of 7.3 billion (net of 1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately 188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to 10.6 billion (net of 1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately 188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes construction contingency of 60 million and is based on projected in-service dates at the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling 2.5 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for the 0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for any subsequent construction and additional contingency costs assigned to the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of 1.1 billion 0.8 billion after tax) in 2018; 149 million 111 million after tax) and 176 million 131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; 48 million 36 million after tax), 460 million 343 million after tax), 264 million 197 million after tax), and 480 million 358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021, respectively; and 36 million 27 million after tax), 32 million 24 million after tax), and 148 million 110 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively. 
 Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Joint Owner Contracts") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately 92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20 of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. 
 Georgia Power recorded additional pre-tax charges (credits) to income of approximately 440 million 328 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2021 and approximately 16 million 12 million after tax), (102) million (76) million after tax), and 53 million 40 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of 407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, regarding the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments described in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction Joint Owner Contracts." Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately 345 million associated with these provisions for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast. 
 Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7 . Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees 
 II-47 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100 of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service. 
 As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics. 
 The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases. 
 Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4, may arise, which may result in additional license amendment requests or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs for Unit 4, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts described in Note 2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to 15 million per month for Unit 3 and 35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material. 
 Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for additional information. 
 
 Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates. 
 Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized. See Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Tax Credit Carryforwards" and " Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information. 
 Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing 
 II-48 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. Any apportionments and/or filing methodologies ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants. 
 Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates. 
 
 Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. 
 The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO. 
 The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information, including updates to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2022 by certain Registrants. 
 Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations. 
 Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The 
 II-49 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations. 
 The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year. 
 The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:

 Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas) 
 The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year and on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that indicate goodwill may be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics. 
 As part of the goodwill impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying amount. 
 Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was 5.2 billion and 5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter 2022, Southern Company recorded a 119 million impairment loss as a result of its annual goodwill impairment test for PowerSecure. 
 The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates. 
 See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill. 
 Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas) 
 The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances. 
 Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets. 
 For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, changes in tax legislation, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project. 
 As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates. 
 During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling 7 million 6 million after tax) and 206 million 105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling 131 million 99 million after tax) related to natural gas storage facilities. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded total pre-tax impairment charges of 84 million 67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged Lease," respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments. 
 
 Revenue Recognition (Southern Power) 
 Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, 
 II-51 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below. 
 Lease Transactions 
 Southern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions 
 If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business. 
 Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power) 
 Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are accounted for under the acquisition method, whereby the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. 
 Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred. 
 See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power) 
 Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment. 
 If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests. 
 Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The 
 II-52 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. 
 
 Contingent Obligations (All Registrants) 
 The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond the original effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. 
 The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt and derivative arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06. 
 The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. No material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY " Overview" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for additional information. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 Overview 
 The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2022. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation fleet transition, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information. 
 Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2022, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided 49 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2023 through 2025, projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows for each of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and hybrid securities in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its 
 II-53 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information. 
 To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with SOFR and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants expects the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact. 
 The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2022 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2023. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" and "Pension Plans," respectively, for additional information. 
 At the end of 2022, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was 71.41 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was 27.93 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 256 , compared to 68.58, 26.30, and 261 , respectively, at the end of 2021. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Total estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2027 based on their current construction programs are as follows: 
 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 (in billions) Southern Company (a)(b)(c) 
 9.1 8.1 7.7 7.9 7.7 Alabama Power (a)

 4.6 3.9 3.6 3.9 3.6 Mississippi Power 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 Southern Power (c) 
 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Southern Company Gas 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 
 (a) Includes expenditures of approximately 0.1 billion in 2023 for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information. 
 (b) Includes expenditures of approximately 1.0 billion and 0.2 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 (c) Excludes approximately 0.5 billion in 2023 and 0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2027 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. 
 These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the Registrants' construction programs.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate continued expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These estimated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2027 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Environmental Matters Environmental Laws and Regulations Coal Combustion Residuals" herein.

 The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects. 
 The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Nuclear Construction" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction expenditures. 
 See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL "Construction Programs" herein for additional information. 
 Other Significant Cash Requirements 
 Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

 Fuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2022. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2022 that extend beyond 2027 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.

 In connection with Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power, which are expected to be accounted for as leases, and are contingent upon approval by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated with the PPAs total 5 million in 2024, 68 million in 2025, 75 million in 2026, 76 million in 2027, and 670 million thereafter. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-term Service Agreements" for additional information. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures related to LTSAs are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Total estimated payments for LTSA commitments at December 31, 2022 that extend beyond 2027 are provided in the following table and include price escalation based on inflation indices:

 Sources of Capital 
 Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions, and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. 
 II-56 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein). Georgia Power intends to continue utilizing short-term floating rate bank loans and commercial paper issuances to fund operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery. 
 The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information. 
 
 Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2022, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for existing tax equity partnerships totaling 51 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under "General" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information. 
 
 The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets. 
 The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below. 
 The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program. 
 Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. 
 By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled 1.5 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.

 Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see "Financing Activities" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants: 
 At December 31, 2022 Southern Company Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern Power Southern Company Gas (in millions) Current liabilities in excess of current assets 5,308 3,179 50 263 532 
 The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company. 
 Bank Credit Arrangements 
 At December 31, 2022, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows: 
 At December 31, 2022 Southern Company parent Alabama Power Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern 
 Power (a) 
 Southern Company Gas (b) 
 SEGCO Southern Company (in millions) Unused committed credit 1,998 1,250 1,726 275 569 1,748 30 7,596 
 (a) At December 31, 2022, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which 14 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities. 
 (b) Includes 798 million and 950 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively. 
 Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was approximately 1.7 billion (comprised of approximately 789 million at Alabama Power, 819 million at Georgia Power, and 69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately 120 million and 288 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information.

 Fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
 
 Southern Company 
 Net cash provided from operating activities increased 133 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increased natural gas cost recovery at the natural gas distribution utilities, largely offset by decreased fuel cost recovery at the traditional electric operating companies. 
 The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction programs. 
 The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term debt, the issuance of common stock to settle the purchase contracts entered into as part of the Equity Units (as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements under "Equity Units"), and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.

 Credit Rating Risk 
 At December 31, 2022, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
 There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2022 were as follows: 
 Credit Ratings Southern Company ) 
 Alabama Power Georgia Power Mississippi Power Southern 
 Power ) 
 Southern Company Gas (in millions) At BBB and/or Baa2 33 1 32 At BBB- and/or Baa3 395 2 61 1 334 At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below 2,036 434 948 330 1,225 21 
 ) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had 106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2022. 
 The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so. 
 Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), have agreements under which Mississippi Power provides retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The

 agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. 
 On February 22, 2022, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to BBB+ from A- with a stable outlook. 
 Also on February 22, 2022, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Southern Power, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO to negative from stable. 
 On December 15, 2022, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive. 
 
 Market Price Risk 
 The Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well as Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional information. 
 Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market. 
 Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively manages storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment. 
 The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants:

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Southern Company and Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt at December 31, 2022 and have each mitigated exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps. See Note 14 to the financial statements under "Foreign Currency Derivatives" for additional information. 
 Changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are provided in the table below. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program.

 (b) The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any. 
 (c) As a result of the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' market risk exposure decreased significantly. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent. 
 The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows: 
 Southern Company Southern Company Gas mmBtu Volume (in millions) 
 At December 31, 2022: Commodity Natural gas swaps 217 Commodity Natural gas options 214 93 Total hedge volume 431 93 At December 31, 2021: Commodity Natural gas swaps 57 Commodity Natural gas options 253 68 Total hedge volume 310 68 
 Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 98 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2022 and the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6 million mmBtu at December 31, 2021. 
 For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately 0.08 per mmBtu above market prices at December 31, 2022 and was approximately 0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.

 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

 The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note 14 to the financial statements. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Southern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein. 
 Southern Company Gas 
 Gas Distribution Operations 
 Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of the 14 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light . For 2022, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 13 of Southern Company Gas' operating revenues and 15 of operating revenues for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment. 
 Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the f orm of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers. 
 II-69 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 
 
 COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. 
 Gas Marketing Services 
 Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88 of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 87 of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2022, are subject to rate regulation by their respective state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 
 The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 II-73 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Georgia Power Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation; completion of documentation to support Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases. 
 The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of 183 million in 2022. 
 In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction and testing; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the forecasted costs and the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule.

 We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges. 
 We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts. 
 We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties. 
 We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project. 
 We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alabama Power Company 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alabama Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Alabama Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Alabama Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Alabama Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Alabama Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Alabama Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Alabama Power) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Alabama Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 
 The Commissions set the rates Alabama Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Alabama Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Alabama Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not 
 II-82 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs and the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Alabama Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Alabama Power and other interested parties that may impact Alabama Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated Alabama Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Georgia Power) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Georgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 
 The Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not 
 II-89 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Georgia Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Georgia Power and other interested parties that may impact Georgia Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated Georgia Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Georgia Power Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation; completion of documentation to support Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves 
 II-90 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases. 
 The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of 183 million in 2022. 
 In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction and testing; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the forecasted costs and the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule. 
 We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges. 
 We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts. 
 We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties. 
 We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project. 
 We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Mississippi Power) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Mississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 
 The Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions 
 II-97 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Mississippi Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Mississippi Power and other interested parties that may impact Mississippi Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated Mississippi Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and subsidiary companies (Southern Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Income/Loss Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Southern Power has entered into a number of tax equity partnership arrangements, wherein they agree to sell 100 of a class of membership interests (e.g. Class A) in an entity to a noncontrolling investor in exchange for cash contributions, while retaining control of the entity through a separate class of membership interests (e.g. Class B). The agreements for these partnerships give different rights and priorities to their owners in terms of cash distributions, tax attribute allocations, and partnership income or loss allocations. These provisions make the conventional equity method of accounting where an investor applies its "percentage ownership interest" to the investee's net income under generally accepted accounting principles to determine the investor's share of earnings or losses difficult to apply. Therefore, Southern Power uses the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) accounting method to account for these partnership arrangements. The HLBV accounting method calculates each partner's share of income or loss based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim at the end of the reporting period compared to the beginning of the reporting period. The application of the HLBV accounting method by Southern Power required significant consideration of the allocations between Southern Power and the noncontrolling investors over the life of the agreement and the liquidation provisions of the agreement to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss between the parties. 
 II-104 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 The determination of the appropriate amount of allocated partnership income or loss to noncontrolling interests using the HLBV accounting method required increased audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge, including evaluation of the terms of the agreement and consideration of the appropriateness of the HLBV model based on the provisions of the agreement. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures included the following, among others: 
 For agreements that result in potentially material allocations of partnership income or loss, we read the agreements to understand the liquidation provisions and the provisions governing the allocation of benefits. 
 We evaluated the HLBV models utilized by management to determine whether the models accurately reflect the allocation of income or loss and tax attributes in accordance with the liquidation provisions and allocation terms defined in the agreements, as well as whether the inputs in the models are accurate and complete.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern Company Gas) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company Gas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment which is accounted for by the use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company Gas include its equity investment in SNG of 1,243 million and 1,129 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of 146 million, 127 million, and 129 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports (which express unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to SNG's significant transactions with related parties) have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88 of Southern Company Gas' consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable state regulatory agencies (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of regulation. Accounting for 
 II-112 

Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 

 the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization. 
 The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy. 
 We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 Board of Directors and Members 
 Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. 
 Houston, Texas 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Postretirement Benefit Obligation 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company's postretirement benefit obligation was 14 million and the Company's plan assets were 59 million, resulting in a net asset position of 45 million. As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the postretirement benefit obligation is primarily based on actuarial calculations, which include various significant assumptions. 
 We identified the Company's estimate of the postretirement benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Auditing the postretirement benefit obligation required complex auditor judgment due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation, which include the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions had a significant effect on the postretirement benefit obligation calculation. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Comparing the actuarial assumptions used by management with historical trends and evaluating the change in the postretirement benefit obligation from prior year due to changes in assumptions. 
 Evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments. 
 Evaluating the expected return on plan assets by assessing whether management's assumptions were consistent with a range of returns for a portfolio of comparative investments that was determined based on publicly available information. 
 Emphasis of Matter Significant Transactions with Related Parties 
 As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant transactions with related parties.

 traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent. 
 The Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See "Variable Interest Entities" herein and Note 7 for additional information. 
 The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

-MW combined cycle facility at Alabama Power's Plant Barry (Plant Barry Unit 8) that is expected to be placed in service in November 2023, (ii) complete the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, which occurred in August 2020, (iii) purchase approximately MWs of combined cycle generation under a long-term PPA, which began in September 2020, and (iv) pursue up to approximately MWs of cost-effective demand-side management and distributed energy resource programs. Alabama Power's petition for a CCN was predicated on the results of Alabama Power's 2019 IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an approximately -MW resource need for Alabama Power, driven by the need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 under "Alabama Power" for additional information on the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station. 
 The Alabama PSC authorized the recovery of actual costs for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 up to above the estimated in-service cost of million. In so doing, it recognized the potential for developments that could cause the project costs to exceed the capped amount, in which case Alabama Power would provide documentation to the Alabama PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of the additional costs. At December 31, 2022, project expenditures associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 totaled approximately million, of which million and million was included in CWIP and property, plant, and equipment in service, respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. The recovery of costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-related costs associated with the PPAs through its Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any remaining costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 are expected to be recovered through Rate RSE. 
 Through May 2023, Alabama Power expects to recover substantially all costs associated with the Central Alabama Generating Station through Rate RSE, offset by revenues from a previous power sales agreement. Beginning in July 2022, fuel costs associated with Central Alabama Generating Station are being recovered through Rate ECR. 
 On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station, a -MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama. The acquisition was approved by the FERC on March 25, 2022. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and, on October 3, 2022, Alabama Power filed Rate CNP New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover the related costs, as described further under "Rate CNP New Plant" herein. Alabama Power is recovering the remaining costs associated with the Calhoun Generating Station through its existing rate structure, primarily Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE. 
 Renewable Generation Certificate 
 Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure up to MWs of renewable capacity and energy by September 16, 2027 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Through December 31, 2022, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately MWs. 
 Rate RSE 
 The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any period, when averaged together, cannot exceed and any annual adjustment is limited to . When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or , to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. 
 Alabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately and , respectively.

and , customers will receive of the amount between and , of the amount between and , and of the amount between and . Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of . During a year with a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds , customers receive of the amount between and and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of . Alabama Power's ability to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range positions Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. There is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. 
 Retail rates under Rate RSE did not change for 2020 or 2022 and increased by , or approximately million annually, effective with the billing month of January 2021. 
 At December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Alabama Power's WCER exceeded , resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of million, million, and million, respectively, for Rate RSE refunds. The 2020 refund was issued to customers through bill credits in April 2021. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power applied million of the 2021 refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining million was refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022. See "Rate ECR" herein for additional information. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023. 
 On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2023. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2023. 
 Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order 
 On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately million in 2023 to offset the impact of the rate increase discussed under "Rate CNP Depreciation" herein. The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Rate CNP New Plant 
 Rate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated generating facilities placed into retail service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period January 2020 through October 2022. On October 3, 2022, Alabama Power filed Rate CNP New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover costs related to the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The filing reflected an increase in annual revenues of million, or , effective with November 2022 billings. See "Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information. 
 Rate CNP PPA 
 Rate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. Revenues for Rate CNP PPA, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2020 through 2022 and no adjustment is expected for 2023. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of million, of which million is included in other regulatory assets, current and million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of million included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. 
 Rate CNP Compliance 
 Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December 1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or

In December 2020 and 2021, the Alabama PSC issued consent orders that Alabama Power leave the 2020 Rate CNP Compliance factors in effect for 2021 and 2022, respectively, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered, and any remaining under recovery reflected in the 2022 filing. The 2022 filing reflected a million, or , annual increase effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of million and million, respectively, included in other regulatory assets, current and other regulatory assets, deferred, respectively, on the balance sheet. 
 Rate CNP Depreciation 
 On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates, excluding any depreciation recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, or costs associated with the capitalization of asset retirement costs. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase of approximately million, or , effective with January 2023 billings. See "Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order" herein for information related to 2023 customer bill credits approved by the Alabama PSC.

 Rate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but will impact the related operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to cents per KWH. 
 In 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by million in accordance with an Alabama PSC order and returned that amount to customers in the form of bill credits. 
 Also in 2020, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from cents per KWH to cents per KWH, equal to , or approximately million annually, that became effective with January 2021 billings and remained in effect through July 2022 billings. 
 The Alabama PSC approved adjustments to Rate ECR from cents per KWH to cents per KWH, or approximately million annually, effective with August 2022 billings and from cents per KWH to cents per KWH, or approximately million annually, effective with December 2022 billings. The rate will adjust to cents per KWH in January 2025 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC. 
 In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power applied million of its 2021 Rate RSE refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance. See "Rate RSE" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled million, of which million is included in other regulatory assets, current and million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled million and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a significant impact on the timing of any recovery or return of fuel costs. 
 Software Accounting Order 
 The Alabama PSC authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset is amortized ratably over the life of the related software. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the regulatory asset balance totaled million and million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.

ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 in December 2025 and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life. The Plant Greene County unit retirements identified by Mississippi Power require the completion of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of the transmission and system reliability improvements. Currently, Alabama Power plans to retire Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 at the dates indicated. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Rate NDR 
 Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below million, a reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches million. 
 The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a period period prior to modifications approved by the Alabama PSC on July 12, 2022). The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. The maximum total Rate NDR charge was limited to per month per non-residential customer account and per month per residential customer account through July 12, 2022. Subsequently, modifications approved by the Alabama PSC replaced the maximum total Rate NDR charge with a maximum charge to recover a deficit of per month per non-residential customer account and per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant, which can be used to offset storm charges. Alabama Power made additional accruals of million and million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Alabama Power collected approximately million, million, and million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, under Rate NDR. Beginning with August 2022 billings, the reserve establishment charge was suspended and the reserve maintenance charge was activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding million. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately million annually under Rate NDR unless the NDR balance falls below million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the NDR balance was million and million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheets. 
 As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows. 
 Reliability Reserve Accounting Order 
 On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds million. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued million to the reserve, which is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet. 
 Environmental Accounting Order 
 Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. 
 With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to certain operating conditions. In September 2022, Alabama Power reclassified approximately million for Plant Barry Unit 5 from plant in service, net of depreciation to other utility plant, net and will continue to

 In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of estimated CCR ARO compliance costs for 2023, 2024, and 2025 over periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditures, resulting in an estimated million reduction in the related amortization expense for 2023. The estimated compliance costs expected to be incurred in 2023, 2024, and 2025 are million, million, and million, respectively. The CCR ARO costs are expected to be revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through future annual compliance filings. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information. 
 Further, under the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at and its equity ratio is set at . Earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of to . Any retail earnings above will be shared, with being applied to reduce regulatory assets, directly refunded to customers, and the remaining retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its retail earnings will be below for any calendar year, it may petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2026 or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case.

 In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of the estimated under recovered balance of CCR ARO compliance costs. Under the 2019 ARP, the under recovered balance at December 31, 2019 and compliance costs for 2020 were recovered over the period ended December 31, 2022. Recovery of estimated compliance costs for 2021 and 2022 are being recovered over periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, as authorized under the 2019 ARP and modified under the 2022 ARP, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The CCR ARO costs recovered through the ECCR tariff are revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through annual compliance filings, which resulted in an approximate million decrease and million increase effective January 1, 2021 and 2022, respectively, in the related cost recovery. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information. 
 Georgia Power's retail ROE under the 2019 ARP was set at and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of to . Any retail earnings above were shared, with applied to reduce regulatory assets, directly refunded to customers, and the remaining retained by Georgia Power. In 2020, Georgia Power's retail ROE was within the allowed retail ROE range. In 2021, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded , and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by approximately million and accrued approximately million which was refunded to customers in 2022. In 2022, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded , and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by approximately million and accrued approximately million, which is expected to be refunded to customers through bill credits later in the first quarter 2023, prior to review and approval by the Georgia PSC, in accordance with the 2022 ARP. 
 Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding 
 In accordance with a Georgia PSC order approved in November 2021, Georgia Power will include in rate base an allocation of billion to Unit 3 and Common Facilities from the billion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and will recover the related depreciation expense through retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. Financing costs on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction costs will continue to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power will defer as a regulatory asset the remaining depreciation expense (approximately million annually) until Unit 4 costs are placed in retail base rates. In addition, the stipulated agreement clarified that following the prudency review, the remaining amount to be placed in retail base rates will be net of the proceeds from the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and will not be used to offset imprudent costs, if any. 
 The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately million also includes recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. As approved by the Georgia PSC, the increase in annual retail base rates will be adjusted based on the actual in-service date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3. 
 See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

 The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 MWs) to the 2025 IRP. Under the 2022 ARP, million annually of the related depreciation is being deferred to a regulatory asset, which will be amortized over beginning in 2031. The Georgia PSC rejected Georgia Power's request to certify approximately MWs of wholesale capacity to be placed in retail rate base between January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. Georgia Power may offer such capacity in the wholesale market or to the retail jurisdiction in a future regulatory proceeding. 
 On August 26, 2022, Restore Chattooga Gorge Coalition (RCG) filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC. The petition challenges Georgia Power's plan to expend million to modernize Plant Tugalo, as approved in the 2019 IRP, and seeks judicial review of the Georgia PSC's order in the 2022 IRP proceeding with respect to the denial of RCG's challenge to the modernization plan. On November 7, 2022, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC both filed motions to dismiss the RCG petition. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
 Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs 
 During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power to defer as a regulatory asset the incremental bad debt resulting from the approved suspension of customer disconnections during certain periods in 2020. The Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

million and million, respectively. In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved a recovery period ending December 31, 2025. 
 Fuel Cost Recovery 
 Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by approximately million over a period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings by approximately million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the second half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding million. Therefore, in November 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates by , or approximately million annually, effective January 1, 2022. During 2022, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance continued to increase significantly due to higher fuel and purchased power costs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023. 
 Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in deferred under recovered fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. 
 Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a -month time horizon. 
 Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows. 
 Storm Damage Recovery 
 Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. During 2020 through 2022, Georgia Power recovered million annually under the 2019 ARP. Effective January 1, 2023, Georgia Power is recovering million annually under the 2022 ARP. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's storm damage reserve balance was million and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on Southern Company's balance sheets and other deferred credits and liabilities on Georgia Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's regulatory asset balance related to storm damage was million and is included in other regulatory assets, current on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 1 under "Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves" for additional information. 
 
 ownership interest. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. 
 In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing in March 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into several transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon days' written notice. 
 In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, under which Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under

 (a) Includes approximately million of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners, including million of construction monitoring costs approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order, and approximately million of incremental costs under the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below. Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately million, of which million had been accrued through December 31, 2022. 
 (b) Net of billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately million in related customer refunds. 
 Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately billion, of which billion had been incurred through December 31, 2022. 
 As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics. Southern Nuclear establishes aggressive target values for monthly construction production and system turnover activities, which are reflected in the site work plans. 
 Since March 2020, the number of active COVID-19 cases at the site has fluctuated consistent with the surrounding area and impacted productivity levels and pace of activity completion, with the site experiencing peaks in the number of active cases in January 2021, August 2021, and January 2022. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plans. As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity is estimated to be between million and million and is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Future COVID-19 variants could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities. 
 On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023, during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain equipment and component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now projected to be placed in service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024. 
 During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling million were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost forecast by million to replenish construction contingency and million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order. 
 After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of million million after tax), million million after tax), and million million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described below.

million per month for Unit 3 and million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material. 
 Joint Owner Contracts 
 In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct. 
 Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements 
 In connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to million of funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

billion (VCM 19 Forecast Amount), plus million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for of actual qualifying construction costs between million and billion over the VCM 19 Forecast Amount (resulting in million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for of qualifying construction costs between billion and billion over the VCM 19 Forecast Amount (resulting in a further million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. The Global Amendments provide that if the EAC is revised and exceeds the VCM 19 Forecast Amount by more than billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget cost forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the VCM 19 Forecast Amount plus billion. 
 For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including epidemics and quarantines, governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by or more. 
 In addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first of costs during any VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The schedule extension announced in February 2022 triggered the requirement for a vote to continue construction. Effective February 25, 2022, all of the Vogtle Owners had voted to continue construction. 
 Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. 
 On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. The lawsuits also assert other claims, including breach of contract allegations, and seek, among other remedies, damages and injunctive relief requiring Georgia Power to track and allocate construction costs consistent with MEAG Power's and OPC's interpretations of the Global Amendments. On July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is billion and that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. In addition, MEAG Power agreed to vote to continue

million million after tax), million million after tax), ) million ( million after tax), and million million after tax), respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately million associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast. 
 Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be . Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of billion. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of billion. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had recovered approximately billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above billion are being recognized through AFUDC and are expected to be recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power is not recording AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently billion) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the NCCR tariff by million annually, effective January 1, 2023. 
 Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power. 
 In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur following Unit 4 fuel load, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC at that time) to effective January 1, 2016, (b) from to

, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from to , effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that effective the first month after Unit 3 reaches commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include the costs related to Unit 3 and common facilities deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement (see "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding" herein for additional information). The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately million, million, and million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately million in 2023 and million in 2024. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction. 
 In the August 2021 order approving the twenty-fourth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation addressing the following matters: (i) beginning with its twenty-fifth VCM report, Georgia Power will continue to report to the Georgia PSC all costs incurred during the period for review and will request for approval costs up to the billion determined to be reasonable in the Georgia PSC's seventeenth VCM order and (ii) Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery of the billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018. In addition, the stipulation confirms Georgia Power may request verification and approval of costs above billion for inclusion in rate base at a later time, but no earlier than the prudence review contemplated by the seventeenth VCM order described previously. 
 The Georgia PSC has approved VCM reports covering periods through June 30, 2021. These reports reflect total construction capital costs incurred of billion (net of billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately million in related customer refunds), of which the Georgia PSC has verified and approved billion as described above. The Georgia PSC also has reviewed additional VCM reports, which reflected billion of additional construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2022. Georgia Power expects to file its twenty-eighth VCM report with the Georgia PSC on February 16, 2023, which will reflect the revised capital cost forecast described above and million of construction capital costs incurred from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. 
 The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
 
 million, or , effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020, based on a test year period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, a average equity ratio, an allowed maximum actual equity ratio of by the end of 2020, and a return on investment. 
 Additionally, the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement: (i) established common amortization periods of for regulatory assets and for regulatory liabilities included in the approved revenue requirement, including those related to unprotected deferred income taxes; (ii) established new depreciation rates reflecting an annual increase in depreciation of approximately million; and (iii) excluded certain compensation costs totaling approximately million. It also eliminated separate rates for costs associated with Plant Ratcliffe and energy efficiency initiatives and includes such costs in the PEP, ECO Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable. 
 Performance Evaluation Plan 
 Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes

); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric service ); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers ). Typically, PEP filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing in March of the current year and the PEP lookback filing in March of the subsequent year. The annual PEP projected filings utilize a historic test year adjusted for "known and measurable" changes and discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine base ROE. The PEP lookback filing reflects the actual revenue requirement. 
 Pursuant to a Mississippi PSC-approved settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS, Mississippi Power was not required to make any PEP filings for the regulatory year 2020. 
 In June 2021 and June 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filings, resulting in annual increases in revenues of approximately million, or , and million, or , respectively, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2021 and April 2022, respectively. 
 Integrated Resource Plan 
 In 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future recovery. 
 In September 2021, the Mississippi PSC concluded its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 MWs) and Mississippi Power's ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 MWs) by the end of 2027. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file its next IRP in April 2024. 
 The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately million at December 31, 2022 and Mississippi Power is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates through the end of 2027. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is expected to total approximately million , to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with the 2020 order. The Plant Watson and Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters Mississippi Power" for additional information on Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2. 
 Environmental Compliance Overview Plan 
 In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations. 
 In June 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2021, resulting in a decrease in revenues of approximately million annually effective with the first billing cycle of July 2021. 
 On April 5, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2022, resulting in an increase in revenues of approximately million annually. The rate increase became effective with the first billing cycle of May 2022. 
 On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2023 indicating no change in retail rates. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Fuel Cost Recovery 
 Mississippi Power annually establishes, and is required to file for an adjustment to, the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC approved a decrease of million effective in February 2020 and increases of million and million effective in February 2021 and 2022, respectively. On November 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by million annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current

million and million, respectively, and were included in other customer accounts receivable on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's balance sheets. 
 Mississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycles for January 2021 , 2022, and 2023, annual revenues under the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased million, increased million, an d increased million, re spectively. The wholesale MB fuel rate did not change materially in any period presented. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, under recovered wholesale fuel costs were million and million , respectively. 
 Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows. 
 Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment 
 Mississippi Power annually establishes an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Effective with the first billing cycle of April 2020, May 2021, and July 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved increases in annual revenues collected through the ad valorem tax adjustment factor of million, million, and million, respectively. The 2021 increase included approximately million of ad valorem taxes previously recovered through PEP in accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. 
 System Restoration Rider 
 Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However, Mississippi Power is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost of such damage through an annual expense accrual which is credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and wholesale jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed is charged to the reserve. Every year, the Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power agree on SRR revenue level(s). 
 Mississippi Power's net retail SRR accrual, which includes carrying costs and amortization of related excess deferred income tax benefits, was million in 2022, ) million in 2021, and million in 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the retail property damage reserve balance was million and million, respectively. 
 In December 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail revenues of approximately million annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022. The Mississippi PSC also established million as the minimum annual accrual amount until a target property damage reserve balance of million is met. In the event the expected annual charges exceed the annual accrual or the target balance has been met, Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC will determine the appropriate change to the annual accrual. Additionally, if PEP earnings are above a certain threshold, Mississippi Power has the ability to apply any required PEP refund as an additional accrual to the property damage reserve in lieu of customer refunds. 
 On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its annual SRR filing to the Mississippi PSC, which indicated no change in retail rates. The filing includes a request to increase the minimum annual accrual from million to million. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Reliability Reserve Accounting Order 
 On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability reserve for the purpose of deferring generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future year. Mississippi Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve each year after meeting with the MPUS and Mississippi PSC staff. Mississippi Power will provide annually, through its capital plan, energy delivery plan, or PEP filing, any amounts to be charged against the reliability reserve during the current year. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued million to the reliability reserve. 
 Software Accounting Order 
 On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to establish a regulatory asset for certain operations and maintenance expenditures related to major technology projects. The recovery period for this regulatory asset will be determined in Mississippi Power's annual PEP filing process. Mississippi Power will begin deferring these costs in 2023.

annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving approximately MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA. 
 On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff. Cooperative Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

million and million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Virginia Natural Gas 
 The Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, allows Virginia Natural Gas to continue replacing aging pipeline infrastructure through 2024. The program includes authorized annual investments of million in 2020, million in 2021, and million in each year from 2022 through 2024, with a total potential variance of up to million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over the term (2019 through 2024) of million . Virginia Natural Gas' capital expenditures under the SAVE program totaled million and million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case approved by the Virginia Commission in 2021, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to November 1, 2020 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to November 1, 2020 are currently being recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings. 
 Atlanta Gas Light 
 In 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the continuation of GRAM as part of Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The amounts to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs have been recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. These allowed costs are primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM and are being recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the related under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2022 was million, including million of unrecognized equity return. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See "Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts" herein for additional information. 
 Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC. 
 See "Rate Proceedings Atlanta Gas Light" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling million for the years 2022 through 2024, of which million was incurred in 2022. 
 Chattanooga Gas 
 In June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately miles of distribution main over a period. The estimated total cost of the program is million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism. 
 Natural Gas Cost Recovery 
 With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2022, the under recovered balance was million, which was included in natural gas cost

million, million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. 
 Rate Proceedings 
 Nicor Gas 
 In November 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of and an equity ratio of . 
 On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a million increase in annual base rate revenues, including million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the period ending December 31, 2024, a return on equity of , and an equity ratio of . Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an additional million under proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
 Atlanta Gas Light 
 The Georgia PSC evaluates Atlanta Gas Light's earnings against a ROE range of to , with disposition of any earnings above to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC allows inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments. GRAM filing rate adjustments are based on an authorized ROE of . GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed of 2020 base rates. The limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light. 
 In 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of million based on the projected -month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 . 
 In February 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a -year forecast of interstate and intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current capacity supply plan, and a -year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects. 
 In April 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which included a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately billion to billion annually. 
 In November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, which resulted in a reduction of million for 2022 and million for 2023. The stipulation agreement also provided for billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024. 
 Also in November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of million effective January 1, 2022. 
 On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of million effective January 1, 2023.

other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the then-serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to include additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On March 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. On May 31, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings. On June 17, 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the complaint. An adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is million and million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of million and million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every . The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2023. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information on joint ownership agreements. 
 Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to billion for members' operating nuclear generating facilities. Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to billion for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to million for non-nuclear losses in excess of the billion primary coverage. 
 NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a 12-week deductible waiting period for each nuclear plant. 
 A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to billion for accidental property damage occurring during construction. 
 Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 under the NEIL policies would be million and million, respectively. 
 Claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy limits). The maximum aggregate that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events in any 12-month period is billion each, plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources. 
 For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.

 Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine located around the Kemper County energy facility site. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028. 
 As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. See Note 6 for additional information. 
 In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund million of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the million of total grants received. In 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of an investigation related to the grants received.

million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In December 2022, Georgia Power recorded a net decrease of approximately million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including lower future inflation rates, higher discount rates, and timing of closure activities, as well as a change in closure methodology for one ash pond as approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information. 
 During 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates. 
 The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2022 using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

 For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2021. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of and for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust earnings rate of and for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. The next site study for Alabama Power is expected to be completed later in 2023. 
 Alabama Power's site-specific estimates of decommissioning costs for Plant Farley are updated every . Projections of funds are reviewed with the Alabama PSC to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide adequate funding to cover the site-specific costs. If necessary, Alabama Power would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements. 
 Under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking was a total of million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Effective January 1, 2023, as approved in the 2022 ARP, there is annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking. Any funding amount required by the NRC during the period covered by the 2022 ARP will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovery is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case.

 PennEast Pipeline Project 
 In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate -mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline does not have federal eminent domain authority over lands in which a state has property rights interests. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PennEast Pipeline following a review of the appellate court decision. Southern Company Gas assesses its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment may be impaired. Following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, during the second quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas management reassessed the project construction timing, including the anticipated timing for receipt of a FERC certificate and all remaining state and local permits, as well as potential challenges thereto, and performed an impairment analysis. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of million million after tax). In September 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project was no longer supported, and, as a result, all further development of the project ceased. During the third quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded an additional pre-tax charge of million million after tax) related to its share of the project level impairment, as well as million of additional tax expense, resulting in total pre-tax charges of million million after tax) during 2021 related to the project.

 ) Amounts related to affiliate leases are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company. See "Contracts that Contain a Lease" herein for additional information. 
 Real estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas and various land leases primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial real estate leases have remaining terms of up to years while the land leases have remaining terms of up to years, including renewal periods. 
 Communication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support the automated meter infrastructure programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower leases have remaining terms of up to years with options to renew that could extend the terms for an additional years. 
 Renewal options exist in many of the leases. Except as otherwise noted, the expected term used in calculating the lease obligation generally reflects only the noncancelable period of the lease as it is not considered reasonably certain that the lease will be extended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power and communication tower leases for automated meter infrastructure at Nicor Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an expected lease term at least equal to the expected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure, respectively. 
 Contracts that Contain a Lease 
 While not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a lease of the underlying electric generating units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based on the amount of scheduled capacity payments due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between one and years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with Southern Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length transaction as reviewed and approved by the Georgia PSC. Amounts related to the affiliate PPAs are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company.

During 2021, of the domestic projects was sold and the agreements for both international projects were terminated. At December 31, 2022, the remaining leveraged lease agreement, which relates to energy generation, had an expected remaining term of . Southern Company continues to receive federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to this investment. Southern Company wrote off the related investment balance in 2020, as discussed below. 
 During the second quarter 2020, following an evaluation of the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets at the end of the lease, Southern Company management concluded it was no longer probable that any of the associated rental payments scheduled after 2032 would be received, because it was no longer probable the generation assets would be successfully remarketed and continue to operate after that date. Revising the estimated cash flows to be received under the leveraged lease to reflect this conclusion resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to earnings of million million after tax).

 On June 30, 2022, the Southern Holdings subsidiary operating the generating plant for the lessee provided notice to the lessee to terminate the related operating and maintenance agreement effective June 30, 2023. The parties to the lease agreement are currently negotiating a potential restructuring, which could result in rescission of the termination notice. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. 
 The lessee failed to make the semi-annual lease payment due December 15, 2022. As a result, the Southern Holdings subsidiary was unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. The parties to the lease have entered into a forbearance agreement which suspends the related contractual rights of the parties while they continue restructuring negotiations. As the remaining amount of Southern Company's lease investment was charged against earnings in the second quarter 2020, termination would not be expected to result in additional charges. Southern Company will continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments and meet its obligations associated with a future closure or retirement of the generation assets and associated properties, including the dry ash landfill.

 When Southern Power recognizes tax credits, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. 
 State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's income tax expense by million in 2022, million in 2021, and million in 2020. 
 Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern Power's income tax expense by million in 2022, million in 2021, and million in 2020. 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs primarily at Southern Power. 
 In July 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent. As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in million of additional net state tax expense. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

 The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2020 primarily relates to a 2019 state tax filing position to exclude certain gains from 2019 dispositions from taxation in a certain unitary state. It is possible that this position will be resolved in the next 12 months, and if accepted by the state, this position would decrease Southern Company's annual effective tax rate. 
 The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2022 is primarily related to the amendment of certain 2018 state tax filing positions related to Southern Company Gas dispositions. If accepted by the states, these positions would decrease Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' annual effective tax rates. The ultimate outcome of these unrecognized tax benefits is dependent on acceptance by each state and is not expected to be resolved within the next 12 months. 
 All of the Registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions was immaterial for all years presented. None of the Registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2023, contributions to any other postretirement trusts are expected.

 The Registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic rebalancing of each trust's portfolio. The Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using an arithmetic mean which represents the expected simple average return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. The Registrants believe the use of the arithmetic mean is more compatible with the expected rate of return's function of estimating a single year's investment return.

 The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic pension cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants' statements of income. 
 Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the market value of return-seeking plan assets over and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

 The following description of the Junior Subordinated Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Subordinated Note Indenture dated as of October 1, 2015, as supplemented and amended (the Subordinated Note Indenture ), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee ). The Subordinated Note Indenture and all supplements thereto are included as exhibits to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this summary is a part. 
 The terms Additional Interest , Business Day , Event of Default , Interest Payment Date , Optional Deferral Period , and Rating Agency Event , as used in this Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes, have the meanings ascribed to them in this Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes. 
 General 
 Each series of Junior Subordinated Notes was issued as a series of junior subordinated notes under the Subordinated Note Indenture. Each Series of Junior Subordinated Notes was initially issued in the applicable aggregate principal amount shown in the table below. The Company may, at any time and without the consent of the holders of any series of Junior Subordinated Notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as any series of Junior Subordinated Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and the initial interest accrual date and initial Interest Payment Date (as defined below), if applicable). Any additional notes having such similar terms, together with the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes, will constitute a single series of junior subordinated notes under the Subordinated Note Indenture. 
 Unless earlier redeemed, the entire principal amount of each series of Junior Subordinated Notes will mature and become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the applicable date set forth in the table below. The Junior Subordinated Notes are not subject to any sinking fund provision. Each series of Junior Subordinated Notes is available for purchase in denominations of 25.00 and integral multiples of 25.00 in excess thereof. 
 Series Original Issuance Amount Maturity Date Series 2017B Junior Subordinated Notes 450,000,000 December 1, 2077 Series 2020A Junior Subordinated Notes 1,000,000,000 January 30, 2080 Series 2020C Junior Subordinated Notes 750,000,000 October 15, 2060 
 
 Interest 
 Each Series of Junior Subordinated Notes bears interest at the applicable rate per annum set forth in the table below (the Securities Rate ). Subject to the Company s right to defer interest payments as described below, interest is payable quarterly in arrears on the applicable dates set forth in the table below of each year (each an Interest Payment Date to the person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business (i) on the Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date if such Junior Subordinated Notes are in 
 3 

book-entry only form or (ii) on the 15th calendar day preceding such Interest Payment Date if such Junior Subordinated Notes are not in book-entry only form (whether or not a Business Day), provided that interest payable at maturity or on a redemption date will be paid to the person to whom principal is payable. The amount of interest payable is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on any series of Junior Subordinated Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. 
 Series Securities Rate Interest Payment Dates Series 2017B Junior Subordinated Notes 5.25 March 1, June 1, September 1, December 1 Series 2020A Junior Subordinated Notes 4.95 January 30, April 30, July 30, October 30 Series 2020C Junior Subordinated Notes 4.20 January 15, April 15, July 15, October 15 
 
 Business Day means a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banks in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee s corporate trust office is closed for business. 
 Payment of principal of any Junior Subordinated Notes will be made only against surrender to the paying agent of such Junior Subordinated Notes. Principal of and interest on Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable, subject to any applicable laws and regulations, at the office of such paying agent or paying agents as the Company may designate from time to time, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of any interest may be made by wire transfer or other electronic transfer or by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to an interest payment as such address shall appear in the security register with respect to the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes. Payment of interest on Junior Subordinated Notes on any applicable Interest Payment Date will be made to the person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment. 
 The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee acts as paying agent with respect to each series of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Company may at any time designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agents or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts with respect to any series of Junior Subordinated Notes. 
 All moneys paid by the Company to a paying agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series which remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal or interest shall have become due and payable will be repaid to the Company, and the holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes will from that time forward look only to the Company for payment of such principal and interest. 
 Option to Defer Interest Payments 
 So long as no Event of Default (as defined below) under the Subordinated Note Indenture has occurred and is continuing, at the Company s option, it may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on any series of Junior Subordinated Notes by extending the interest payment period for up to 40 consecutive quarterly periods (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise 
 4 

have been made, an Optional Deferral Period ). A deferral of interest payments with respect to a series of Junior Subordinated Notes may not extend beyond the maturity date of such series or end on a day other than an Interest Payment Date with respect to such series. Any deferred interest on a series of Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue additional interest at the applicable Securities Rate from the applicable Interest Payment Date to the date of payment, compounded quarterly (such deferred interest and additional interest accrued thereon, Additional Interest ), to the extent permitted under applicable law. No interest will be due and payable on such series of Junior Subordinated Notes until the end of the applicable Optional Deferral Period, except upon a redemption of such series of Junior Subordinated Notes during such Optional Deferral Period. 
 At the end of an Optional Deferral Period or on any redemption date, the Company will be obligated to pay all accrued and unpaid interest, including any Additional Interest with respect to the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes. Once the Company pays all accrued and unpaid interest payments on the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest, the Company can again defer interest payments on such series of Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the maturity date of such series. 
 The Company is required to provide to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee written notice of any optional deferral of interest at least 10 and not more than 60 Business Days prior to the earlier of (1) the next applicable Interest Payment Date or (2) the date, if any, upon which it is required to give notice of such Interest Payment Date or the record date therefor to the New York Stock Exchange or any applicable self-regulatory organization. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee an officers certificate stating that no default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Subject to receipt of the officers certificate, the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee is required to promptly forward such notice to each holder of record of the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes. 
 Certain Limitations During an Optional Deferral Period 
 During an Optional Deferral Period, subject to the exceptions noted below, the Company shall not 
 declare or pay any dividend or make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, or 
 make any payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities (including guarantees) issued by the Company which rank equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes. 
 None of the foregoing, however, shall restrict 
 any of the actions described in the preceding sentence resulting from any reclassification of the Company s capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company s capital stock for another class or series of the Company s capital stock 
 the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company s capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged

 Subordination 
 The Junior Subordinated Notes are subordinated and junior in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company. No payment of principal of (including redemption payments, if any), premium, if any, on or interest on (including Additional Interest) the Junior Subordinated Notes may be made if (a) any Senior Indebtedness is not paid when due and any applicable grace period with respect to such default has ended with such default not being cured or waived or otherwise ceasing to exist, or (b) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness has been accelerated because of a default, or (c) notice has been given of the exercise of an option to require repayment, mandatory payment or prepayment or otherwise of the Senior Indebtedness. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company to creditors upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets or liabilities, or any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings of the Company, the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness before the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes are entitled to receive or retain any payment or distribution. Subject to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness, the rights of the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Junior Subordinated Notes are paid in full. 
 The term Senior Indebtedness means, with respect to the Company, (i) any payment due in respect of indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of execution of the Subordinated Note Indenture or incurred, created or assumed after such date, (a) in respect of money borrowed (including any financial derivative, hedging or futures contract or similar instrument) and (b) evidenced by securities, debentures, bonds, notes or other similar instruments issued by the Company that, by their terms, are senior or senior subordinated debt securities including, without limitation, all such obligations under its indentures with various trustees (ii) all capital lease obligations (iii) all obligations issued or assumed as the deferred purchase price of property, all conditional sale obligations and all obligations of the Company under any title retention agreement (but excluding trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business and long-term 
 6 

purchase obligations) (iv) all obligations for the reimbursement of any letter of credit, banker s acceptance, security purchase facility or similar credit transaction (v) all obligations of the type referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above of other persons the payment of which the Company is responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor or otherwise and (vi) all obligations of the type referred to in clauses (i) through (v) above of other persons secured by any lien on any property or asset of the Company (whether or not such obligation is assumed by the Company), except for (1) any such indebtedness that is by its terms subordinated to or that ranks equally with the junior subordinated notes issued under the Subordinated Note Indenture and (2) any unsecured indebtedness between or among the Company or its affiliates. Such Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and be entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions contained in the Subordinated Note Indenture irrespective of any amendment, modification or waiver of any term of such Senior Indebtedness. 
 The Subordinated Note Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of Senior Indebtedness that may be issued by the Company. Since the Company is a holding company, the right of the Company and, hence, the right of creditors of the Company (including holders of Junior Subordinated Notes) to participate in any distribution of the assets of any subsidiary of the Company, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of each subsidiary. 
 Optional Redemption 
 At any time and from time to time on or after the applicable date set forth in the table below (the Initial Optional Redemption Date ), the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company in whole or in part upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed to the redemption date.

 If notice of redemption is given as aforesaid, the Junior Subordinated Notes so to be redeemed will, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and from and after such date (unless the Company has defaulted in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest) such Junior Subordinated Notes shall cease to bear interest. If any Junior Subordinated Note called for redemption shall not be paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption date at the applicable Securities Rate. 
 The Company may also redeem the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes before the applicable Initial Optional Redemption Date (i) in whole, but not in part, if certain changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations occur, at the redemption price and under the circumstances described below under Right to Redeem Upon a Tax Event and (ii) in whole, but not in part, if a rating agency makes certain changes in the equity credit criteria for securities such as the applicable 
 7 

series of Junior Subordinated Notes, at the redemption price and under the circumstances described below under Right to Redeem Upon a Rating Agency Event. 
 Subject to the foregoing and to applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Company or its affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, purchase outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes by tender, in the open market or by private agreement. 
 Right to Redeem Upon a Tax Event 
 Before the applicable Initial Optional Redemption Date, the Company may redeem, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, in whole but not in part, any series of Junior Subordinated Notes following the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined below), at the applicable percentage of the principal amount of such series set forth in the table below plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including any Additional Interest) to the redemption date. 
 Series Percentage of Principal Amount Series 2017B Junior Subordinated Notes 101 Series 2020A Junior Subordinated Notes 101 Series 2020C Junior Subordinated Notes 100 
 A Tax Event happens when the Company has received an opinion of counsel experienced in tax matters that, as a result of 
 any amendment to, clarification of, or change, including any announced prospective change, in the laws or treaties of the United States or any of its political subdivisions or taxing authorities, or any regulations under those laws or treaties 
 an administrative action, which means any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation 
 any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any administrative action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to an administrative action or judicial decision that differs from the previously generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, regardless of the time or manner in which that amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known or 
 a threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with the Company s audit or an audit of any of its subsidiaries, or a publicly-known threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes, 
 which amendment, clarification or change is effective or the administrative action is taken or judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued or threatened challenge is asserted or becomes publicly known after the date of the original issuance of the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on such series of 
 8 

Junior Subordinated Notes is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. 
 Right to Redeem Upon a Rating Agency Event 
 Before the applicable Initial Optional Redemption Date, the Company may redeem, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, in whole but not in part, any series of Junior Subordinated Notes following the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), at 102 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including any Additional Interest) to the redemption date. 
 Rating Agency Event means a change to the methodology or criteria that were employed by an applicable nationally recognized statistical rating organization for purposes of assigning equity credit to securities such as the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes on the date of original issuance of such series, which change reduces the amount of equity credit assigned to such series as compared with the amount of equity credit that such rating agency had assigned to such series as of the date of original issuance thereof. 
 Registration and Transfer 
 The Company shall not be required to (i) issue, register the transfer of or exchange Junior Subordinated Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series called for redemption or (ii) issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Junior Subordinated Notes so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Junior Subordinated Note being redeemed in part. 
 Events of Default 
 The following are the Events of Default with respect to each series of Junior Subordinated Notes 
 failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on or interest on the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes when due at maturity or earlier redemption 
 failure to pay interest on the applicable series of Junior Subordinated Notes (including Additional Interest) when due and payable (other than at maturity or upon earlier redemption) that continues for 30 days (subject to the Company s right to optionally defer interest payments) or 
 certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company. 
 With respect to each series of Junior Subordinated Notes, the term Default means the following event default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Company in the Subordinated Note Indenture (other than (i) a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is addressed in the preceding paragraph or (ii) certain other covenants and warranties inapplicable to such series of Junior Subordinated Notes), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after specified written notice to the Company by the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee, or to the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee by the holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of such series. 
 9

If any provision of the Agreement is determined by any court of law or equity with jurisdiction over this matter to be unreasonable or unenforceable, in whole or in part, as written, the parties hereby consent to and affirmatively request that said court reform the provision so as to be reasonable and enforceable and that said court enforce the provision as reformed. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements contained in the Agreement will be construed as covenants and agreements independent of each other or any other contract between the parties hereto and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company or any other affiliate of Southern, whether predicated upon the Agreement or any other contract, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company or any other affiliate of Southern of the covenants and agreements. 
 18. Interpretation . 
 The judicial body interpreting the Agreement will not construe the terms of the Agreement more strictly against one party, it being agreed that both parties and or their attorneys or agents have negotiated and participated in the preparation hereof. 
 19. Certain Tax Matters .

 This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and both of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 
 22. Entire Agreement.
