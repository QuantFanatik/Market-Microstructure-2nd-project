 PART I Item 1. Business Who We Are We are a specialty insurance company that provides property and casualty insurance products to individuals and businesses. We use our underwriting and analytical expertise to provide products for select markets that we believe are underserved by other insurance companies, including the market for earthquake insurance. We use proprietary data analytics and a modern technology platform to offer our customers flexible products with customized and granular pricing for both the admitted and excess and surplus lines E S markets. We provide admitted insurance products through our Oregon domiciled insurance company, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company PSIC ), and E S insurance products through our Arizona domiciled surplus lines insurance company, Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company PESIC ). Each of our insurance company subsidiaries carries an A- rating from A.M. Best Company A.M. Best ), a leading rating agency for the insurance industry. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including retail agents, program administrators, wholesale brokers, and partnerships with other insurance companies. Our business strategy is supported by a comprehensive risk transfer program with reinsurance coverage that we believe reduces earnings volatility and provides appropriate levels of protection from catastrophic events. Our management team combines decades of insurance industry experience across specialty underwriting, reinsurance, program administration, distribution, and analytics. Founded in 2014, we have significantly grown our business and have generated attractive returns. We have organically increased gross written premiums from 16.6 million in our first year of operations to 881.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of approximately 64 . We have also been profitable since 2016 and our net income growth since 2016 reflects a compound annual growth rate of 41 . We seek to continuously grow our income by developing product offerings for lines of business that harness our core competencies and where we believe we can generate attractive risk adjusted returns. Since 2021, we have introduced several new products including General Casualty, Fronting, Excess Liability, and Excess Property to diversify our book of business and broaden our product portfolio. We believe that our market opportunity, distinctive products, and differentiated business model position us to grow our business profitably. Our Business Our management team founded our company to address unmet needs that we perceived to exist in certain specialty insurance markets. These markets have primarily been served by either large generalist insurance companies and state-managed entities applying one-size-fits-all pricing and policy forms across broad geographies. We sell both admitted and surplus lines products. Our admitted products feature rates and policy forms approved by state insurance departments and are backed by state guaranty funds, providing a further level of security to policyholders. We believe that for our personal lines products, both our customers and distribution partners prefer the ease of use and security of admitted products with flexible coverages. We write surplus lines policies primarily for our commercial business. As the E S market does not involve the same level of regulation and required approvals as the admitted market, our surplus lines products enable us to react quickly to changing market conditions. We believe that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns through underwriting which better reflects our customers underlying risk by applying a more granular approach to pricing than what is typically offered by standard carriers. We believe this market acceptance and return potential is evidenced by the fact that we have quickly and profitably grown to be the 4 th largest earthquake insurer in the state of California and the 5 th largest earthquake insurer in the United States. We continue to experience growth and profitability across our other lines of business.

 Our primary lines of business include: Residential and Commercial Earthquake, Fronting, and Inland Marine. We seek to write a diverse mix of business by loss exposure, customer type and geography to capitalize on market opportunities, mitigate the potential impact of any single catastrophe event, and reduce our cost of reinsurance. We continue to develop product offerings for lines of business that harness our core competencies and where we believe we can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Notable recent examples of our commitment to developing new products include the expansion of our Casualty and Fronting operations during 2022. We believe these markets complement our existing product offerings and offer significant growth opportunity across both the admitted and E S markets. We seek to have a diversified business mix, anchored by our core earthquake offerings and we have made substantial progress diversifying our business by product, market, and geography. In 2014, our first year of operations, all our premiums were related to earthquake insurance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 39 of our gross written premiums were related to earthquake insurance and non-earthquake related premiums grew 96 while earthquake related premiums grew 32 versus the prior year.

 Our admitted insurance subsidiary, PSIC, is licensed in 37 states and we have the flexibility to write nationally through our surplus lines subsidiary, PESIC. California represents our largest current exposure with 47 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our business strategy involves continuing to grow our core earthquake insurance business while also diversifying our book of business into uncorrelated products such as Casualty and Fronting and extending the reach of heritage lines of business such as Inland Marine. The following charts illustrate our business mix by product, residential versus commercial markets, state, and entity for the year ended December 31, 2022: We employ a highly granular and analytical underwriting process to assess each insurance policy that we write, and we ensure that the risk characteristics of business assumed through our channel partnerships or written by program administrator partners are consistent with our underwriting of direct business. Our systems enable us to underwrite all of our personal lines business automatically within minutes by leveraging our proprietary modeling techniques to analyze data at the geocode or ZIP code level. With our commercial products, we balance automation with human expertise and controls to underwrite more complex risks. Because the data we collect through our underwriting process is highly granular, we can utilize detailed portfolio analytics to actively manage aggregation of policies and to ensure an appropriate dispersion of risks across our full portfolio. Similarly, our casualty products are subject to extensive risk analysis, including review by experienced underwriters, thorough actuarial review, fostering broker relationships to obtain complete underwriting information, and accurately assessing and quantifying loss exposures to inform pricing, terms and conditions, limits, and attachment points.

 Our Competitive Strengths We believe that our competitive strengths include: Focus on capturing market share and expanding underserved markets. We focus on specialty insurance markets that we believe are underserved, and where we believe we can capture market share and expand the market to new customers. In our target markets, there are few direct competitors who focus exclusively on specialty risks. With our specialized knowledge of these risks and our customized products, pricing and risk management, we believe we can better serve these markets than our competitors. Furthermore, we can expand our markets by creating products that attract insureds who previously had not obtained coverage. Our focus and expertise have enabled us to rapidly increase our market share; for example, we have grown to become the 4 th largest earthquake insurer in California and the 5 th largest earthquake insurer in the United States. In markets with similar characteristics, we are experiencing growth and profitability across our other lines of business. We believe that our focus on addressing the needs of underserved specialty markets provides us with a competitive advantage. Differentiated products built with the customer in mind. We have invested significant time and resources into developing what we believe are innovative and unique product offerings to address customer needs within our target markets. Our products generally offer our customers flexible features that are not typical of standard products in our markets. By offering our customers the ability to manage pricing, coverage options, and deductibles, we believe we have created products that are attractive both to those who have existing coverages with our competitors, and to those who have not historically bought insurance in our target markets. Furthermore, since our admitted products have been approved by individual state regulators and have been supported by proprietary pricing models since inception, we believe that these products are not easily replicable, particularly by existing carriers who would face the burden of gathering data, building new models, and revising existing rates and policy forms with regulators. Product offerings in both the admitted and E S markets. We believe that our core capabilities can be applied to both the admitted as well as the E S insurance markets. Admitted products are backed by state guarantee funds and, as a result, are subject to more regulation, as admitted insurance companies must receive approval for rates and policy forms from individual state regulators. Our admitted insurance company subsidiary, PSIC, is licensed to write business in 37 states. We primarily serve the personal lines insurance market through the sale of admitted insurance products as those risks tend to be more homogenous in nature and retail agents prefer the sale of admitted products. We offer E S insurance products through our surplus lines insurance company subsidiary, PESIC, which is licensed to do business on a national basis. We primarily serve the commercial lines insurance market through the sale of E S insurance products as those markets are better suited to the flexibility of rate and form available to E S carriers. Having E S offerings allows us to react quickly to changing market conditions and to accelerate the expansion of our business nationally as we do not have to go through the process of receiving required approvals from individual state regulators. Analytically driven, disciplined and scalable underwriting. Our underwriting approach combines decades of specialized underwriting experience of our management team with sophisticated, customized modeling tools we have developed that utilize extensive geospatial and actuarial data across all our lines of business. Our proprietary models enable automated pricing of risks at the geocode or ZIP code level, in contrast to our competitors who we believe use less granular analytics and more manual underwriting processes. For example, our Residential Flood products underwrite risks at the distinct address level compared to broader pricing zones employed by alternative product offerings in the market. Our analytical pricing framework is embedded in all facets of our business and is incorporated into our filings, pricing, underwriting and risk management. We believe that our analytically-driven underwriting approach has been the foundation of our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted underwriting margins. Multi-channel distribution model. Our open architecture distribution framework allows us to attract and underwrite business from multiple channels. We work with a wide variety of retail agents, program administrators, and wholesale brokers. We serve over 25 insurance companies as a specialty partner either by issuing companion policies or providing reinsurance for their in-force risks that fit our strict underwriting parameters. The breadth and flexibility of our distribution model allows us to generate premium from many different parts of the insurance ecosystem and to rapidly take advantage of changing market conditions.

 Sophisticated and conservative risk transfer program. Our risk transfer program utilizes excess of loss, quota share and property per risk coverages for both our property and casualty products. We manage our exposure to catastrophe events through several risk mitigation strategies, including the purchase of reinsurance. We believe that our reinsurance program provides appropriate levels of protection and improves visibility into our earnings. Our current reinsurance program is designed to limit our net loss before tax from a single event to 12.5 million , equivalent to approximately 3.2 of our total stockholders equity as of December 31, 2022. At each reinsurance treaty renewal, we consider any plans to change the underlying insurance coverage we offer, our current capital, our risk appetite, and the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage, which may vary from time to time. In addition to the magnitude of coverage, we believe our reinsurance program provides us with significant protection and stability during potential periods of multiple severe catastrophes or market volatility due to our use of aggregate reinsurance protection as well as features such as prepaid reinstatements and expanded coverage windows for catastrophe events and our diverse panel of more than 100 highly rated reinsurers and capital markets investors. Further, we buy program specific quota share reinsurance coverage for certain lines of business to mitigate the impact of attritional losses on underwriting results. In our quota share agreements, we cede a portion of our premium for lines of business subject to attritional losses to reinsurers and, in return, we also cede a proportionate amount of losses and receive ceding commissions from the reinsurers. Emphasis on the use of technology and analytics across our business. We have built a proprietary operating platform that employs best practices derived from our management team s extensive prior experience. Our technology platform is not burdened by outdated technology and processes which may be utilized by older insurance companies. In building our platform, we have emphasized automated processes that use granular data and analytics consistently across all aspects of our business. Our internally developed Palomar Automated Submission System PASS acts as our interface with retail agents and wholesale brokers. PASS serves as the conduit to our policy administration system that integrates policy issuance, underwriting, billing and portfolio analytics. Our platform enables us to rapidly quote and bind policies via automated processing, and also to run detailed risk-management analytics for internal and external constituents including distribution partners, carrier partners and reinsurers. We believe that this real-time access to data and analytics provides us with an advantage in distributing our products, managing our risk, and purchasing reinsurance. Entrepreneurial and highly experienced management team and board. Our management team is highly qualified, with an average of more than twenty years of relevant experience in insurance, reinsurance and capital markets. We are led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mac Armstrong, who prior to founding Palomar was President of Arrowhead General Insurance Agency Arrowhead ). Many of our management team members such as Mr. Armstrong, Jon Christianson, our President, Jon Knutzen, our Chief Risk Officer, and Chris Uchida, our Chief Financial Officer, have a long history of working together. For example, while at Arrowhead, Mac Armstrong worked closely with Chris Uchida, who served as Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of Arrowhead. As owners of approximately 2.8 of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2022, we believe our management team has closely aligned interests with our stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors is comprised of accomplished industry veterans who bring decades of experience from their prior roles working in insurance and financial services companies. Our Strategy We believe that our approach will allow us to achieve our goals of both growing our business and generating attractive returns. Our strategy involves: Expand our presence in existing markets. We compete in the United States property and casualty market that represented nearly 800 billion in total written premiums during 2021. By comparison, we generated 881.9 million of gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that our differentiated product offerings will enable us to continue growing in our existing markets by (i) gaining market share from competitors who have less flexible product offerings; (ii) continuing to expand our strong distribution network; and (iii) increasing the total addressable market by providing attractive products to customers who previously elected not to purchase coverage. We continue to evaluate additional geographic markets and lines of business where we believe we can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by harnessing our core competencies.

 Maintain our distinctive combination of profitability and growth. Our analytically informed risk selection and disciplined underwriting guidelines enable us to identify segments of the market that are both underserved and mispriced. As a result, we are able to generate an attractive underwriting profit through expanding the addressable market and winning market share with our distinctive products. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our return on equity ROE was 13.4 and 12.1 , and our adjusted ROE was 18.3 and 13.8 , respectively. As we seek premium growth, we intend to remain disciplined in our pricing, underwriting, and risk management processes, including closely managing our net probable maximum loss PML ), average annual loss AAL ), and spread of risk. We will remain focused on lines of business with attractive pricing dynamics and a favorable risk / return profile, and we will not participate in markets where we believe our business model cannot add incremental value. Maintain a diversified book of business. We currently write a book of specialty insurance that is diversified by underlying loss exposure, customer type and geography. Our major product lines and exposures are uncorrelated, such that events contributing to a loss in one line of business are unlikely to generate material losses in our other lines of business. The diversification of our book of business improves our risk-adjusted returns, insulates us from swings in any single insurance or reinsurance market, and allows us to capitalize on market shifts opportunistically. As we grow, we intend to maintain a diversified book of business and continually capitalize on these advantages. Leverage our underwriting, analytics, and risk transfer acumen to generate fee income. We generate fee income by underwriting on behalf of other insurance companies and through the use of quota share reinsurance treaties whereby third-party reinsurers pay us a ceding commission in order to access attractive pools of risk. Our fronting business offers an additional source of fee income that we earn from program administrators and reinsurers seeking to access our licensed insurance companies. Our multi-channel distribution model produces attractive business that we aim to translate into a balanced mix of underwriting and fee income. As a result, we have an increasing number of partnerships where we write policies on behalf of other insurance and reinsurance companies who pay us a ceding commission to access the business. We believe these partnerships are an important validation of the intellectual property and expertise we have developed, and that this strategy enables us to scale our business more quickly and profitably and provides a growing and valuable fee stream to complement our profitable underwriting operations. Continue to purchase conservative reinsurance coverage, while optimizing for risk-adjusted returns. We believe that protecting our earnings and balance sheet through the use of reinsurance is critical to our business and supports our ability to meet obligations to our policyholders and other constituents, and generate strong returns for our stockholders. We plan to maintain a conservative, robust reinsurance program to provide protection against severe or frequent catastrophe losses. Our goal is to protect our earnings by constructing a reinsurance program that mitigates losses and ensures profitability in spite of potential shock losses or catastrophic activity. As we grow, we expect that we will benefit from increased scale and diversification of risk in our business, and we plan to optimize our reinsurance program continuously by adjusting terms, structure, pricing, and participants to maximize our risk-adjusted returns. Continue to invest in proprietary technology assets that deepen our competitive advantage. We believe that the success of our business is centered upon our relentless commitment to using technology to improve our business. For example, we have dedicated software developers focused on building application programming interfaces APIs ), which enable seamless integration into the point of sale systems of our partner carriers and distribution partners. This integration increases the ease of use for our partners, embeds us within their systems, and facilitates real-time sharing of information between our distribution, underwriting, and risk management functions. We will continue to evaluate and invest in proprietary and third-party technology assets, which deepen our competitive advantage, strengthen our operations, and improve our returns. History We are an insurance holding company that was originally incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands in October 2013. In March 2019, we (i) implemented a domestication pursuant to Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and became a Delaware corporation. Our primary operating subsidiary, PSIC, is an insurance company domiciled in the state of Oregon and is an admitted insurer licensed to write business in 37 states as of December 31, 2022. PSIC was formed in February 2014. In

Table of Contents 
 August 2014, we incorporated Palomar Specialty Reinsurance Company Bermuda Ltd.( PSRE ), a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary that provides reinsurance support exclusively to PSIC and PESIC. In August 2015, we incorporated Prospect General Insurance Agency, Inc., now known as Palomar Insurance Agency, Inc., PIA ), to underwrite specialty insurance products on behalf of third-party insurance companies. During 2020, we received regulatory approval for and capitalized PESIC. PESIC is domiciled in the State of Arizona and licensed in Arizona to write surplus lines business on a nationwide basis across all our existing lines of business. Our Products We provide personal and commercial specialty insurance products in our target markets. With the goal of giving customers better options, we designed an analytical framework to create flexible products with innovative coverages and pricing that we believe better reflects the underlying risk. Using this framework, we initially introduced residential and commercial earthquake products in 2014 and have subsequently expanded our product portfolio to cover multiple specialty risks in several regions of the United States. We have grown our business by entering markets that demonstrated one or more of the following attributes: (i) have loss characteristics, including limited attritional losses, similar to our initial earthquake product, (ii) can benefit from our technology platform, data analytics and customer centric products, and/or (iii) allow us to leverage our existing underwriting talent, reinsurance expertise and/or distribution relationships. Our primary insurance products include Residential and Commercial Earthquake, Fronting, and Inland Marine. We aim to develop a diversified portfolio with exposure spread across geographic regions with limited correlation. Although our largest exposure remains in the state of California, we have expanded across the United States. We tailor our risk participation to optimize our returns depending on the conditions of specific markets. In total, we are licensed as an admitted insurer in 37 total states.

 We believe that maintaining a balanced book of personal and commercial lines business is beneficial. For example, while our Residential Earthquake products experience higher premium retention rates, our Commercial Earthquake products provide more flexibility on pricing, which enables us to increase premium rates more quickly when market conditions accommodate price increases. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 37 of our gross written premium consisted of personal lines business and 63 of gross written premium consisted of commercial lines business, compared to 54 personal lines business and 46 commercial lines business during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our products insure against damage to the home, contents and any appurtenant structures, and reimburse for temporary housing costs in the event of an earthquake. We design our products to provide agents and policyholders with coverage flexibility, including a full range of deductible options and the ability to tailor limits to a customer s individual preferences. We aim to sell our products to buyers who may not have previously purchased earthquake coverage. We believe that our pricing model is a distinctive feature of our product offering. Using data from industry-leading catastrophe models we can evaluate and accurately price exposures at the ZIP code or geocode level based on characteristics particular to the risk. For example, we believe competing earthquake insurance products in California are commonly based on broad territorial pricing zones that do not consider regional differences in soil types, liquefaction potential and include little price differentiation between risks with varying proximity to known faults. Our ability to divide geographies into highly resolute grids, or ZIP codes, and price according to more detailed information relating to the exposure allows us to obtain a more appropriate rate for the risk, and often allows us to offer rate relief, particularly in low risk areas that historically have low earthquake insurance penetration. We write policy limits up to 15 million; all policies involve automated underwriting and lower limit policies are issued via automated processing. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Residential Earthquake products had a premium retention rate of approximately 91 . Commercial Earthquake We offer Commercial Earthquake products, commonly known as Difference in Conditions policies, on an admitted basis in 15 states and nationwide on an E S basis. Our Commercial Earthquake products focus on providing coverage for benign commercial risks where the business interruption exposure is typically less than 15 of the total insured value TIV ). We attempt to avoid risks where the contents are hard to value or represent a disproportionate

 percentage of the value. We write policy limits up to 25 million with the ability to serve larger accounts using facultative reinsurance. Fronting Our Fronting business offers both admitted and E S products to reinsurers, insurance carriers and managing general agents to enable the design and operation of customized insurance programs. We issue insurance policies for other insurance companies which may not have the licensure, product suite or rating to serve their desired markets, or for programs supported by reinsurance or alternative capital providers. In addition, we enter fronting arrangements with program administrators that require a broadly licensed, highly rated carrier to conduct their business in certain states. Inland Marine Our Inland Marine products include Builder s Risk, Contractor s Equipment, Mobile Equipment, Motor Truck Cargo, Miscellaneous Floaters, Installation Floaters, and Special Property Floaters. We write our Inland Marine products on an admitted and on an E S basis directly and through program administrators. Policy limits vary by product, however, our E S offerings are designed to target larger limit business and does not directly compete with our admitted offerings. We believe the flexibility of our Inland Marine products enables us to compete in select market segments and price risk appropriately. Commercial All Risk We offer Commercial All Risk insurance on a E S basis nationwide through the underwriting division of a national wholesaler. Our products currently compete in the national layered and shared commercial property market, an area where we believe there is currently a high-level of market dislocation. The Commercial All Risk policy covers the perils of fire and wind, with wind including hurricane, tornado, and hailstorm. For additional premium, the policy can include the peril of earthquake. We target occupancy types including government entities, homeowner s associations, retail stores, hotels, motels, and office buildings. Previously, we wrote this business on a direct admitted basis in select states in the Southeastern United States. During 2020, we ceased writing this business on an admitted basis and as of December 31, 2021, all admitted Commercial All Risk business has been run off. Hawaii Hurricane We offer admitted residential property coverage for named hurricanes in the state of Hawaii. The state requires this coverage for homeowners that carry a mortgage on their properties. Similar to our residential earthquake product, insureds have the ability to tailor limits to their preferences. The policies we write only trigger coverage if wind damage occurs while the insured risk is in a county that is under a hurricane watch or warning as deemed by the Pacific division of the National Weather Service. Coverage only remains in effect for a period of 72 hours after the hurricane watch or warning expires. Therefore, there is no exposure to attritional losses with this product. We believe our products are preferred by local retail agents due to our A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) rating by A.M. Best. We write policy limits up to 15 million; all policies involve automated underwriting and policies under 5 million in limit are issued via automated processing. Specialty Homeowners Our Specialty Homeowners product previously provided admitted insurance coverage to homeowners in wind-exposed coastal regions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we ceased writing Specialty Homeowners policies outside the state of Texas and converted our Texas Specialty Homeowners business to a fronting arrangement. We do not plan to write Specialty Homeowners business in the future.

 Residential Flood We provide residential flood products on an admitted basis in 14 states and on an E S basis in 16 states across the United States. Our products primarily compete against those of the NFIP, which caps dwelling coverage at 250,000 and prices risk using less granular regional zones. We offer higher limits than the NFIP and price risk at the specific geocode level having developed detailed granular models of all current markets in partnership with a leading national catastrophe modeling agency. Furthermore, due to our proprietary pricing grid models we eliminate the need for a waiting period or an elevation certificate prior to binding and issuance of policies. We write policy limits up to 5 million, all of which involve automated underwriting and are issued via automated processing. Casualty We provide casualty products on an admitted and non-admitted basis. We write primarily general casualty and professional liability coverages directly and through program administrators. We utilize experienced underwriters and thorough actuarial review to optimize our pricing, terms and conditions, limits, and attachment points. Other Examples of our other product offerings include assumed reinsurance contracts where the exposure is uncorrelated to our existing product offerings. We continuously seek to develop product offerings and write business in areas that harness our core competencies and where we believe we can generate attractive risk adjusted returns.

 Marketing and Distribution We market and distribute our products through a multi-channel, open architecture distribution model which includes retail agents, wholesale brokers, program administrators and carrier partnerships. We have well-defined underwriting criteria and have designed our distribution model to access our targeted risks through what we believe to be the most efficient channels. Retail Agents: We primarily distribute our personal lines products through retail agents. We believe that retail agents are an important pillar of our distribution model due to the high retention rates and rate stability that we are able to achieve with policies sold through this channel. We provide agents with flexible products that are preferred by end consumers and are easier for agents to sell. In many cases, we provide agents with direct access to our policy management system that enables them to quote, bind and issue policies in a matter of minutes. We believe this ease of use and quick speed-to-quote serves as a competitive advantage. Wholesale Brokers: We distribute our commercial lines products primarily through wholesale brokers. Wholesale brokers are an important channel for commercial property insurance products as they control much of the premium in these segments. We select wholesale brokers based on our management s review of their experience, knowledge, and business plan. We target brokers with the experience to serve our target markets and with business plans consistent with our strategy and underwriting objectives. Brokers must demonstrate an ability to produce both the quality and quantity of business that we seek. To assist with this goal, our underwriters regularly visit with brokers to market and discuss the products we offer. Program Administrators: Within select lines of business, we partner with program administrators to harness the efficiency and scale of their existing marketing and distribution infrastructures. Generally, all policies bound by our program administrators are pre-underwritten using our pricing models which have been programmed into the policy administration system of each partner. For business that is not automatically underwritten, we set strict underwriting guidelines to which our partners must adhere. We audit the underwriting, systems, financial strength and reporting capabilities of all of our program administrators on a regular basis. Most notably, for our Value Select Residential Earthquake products, we have a mutually exclusive program administrator agreement with Arrowhead for the states of California, Oregon and Washington. Under this agreement, which accounted for 173.1 million of written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022, we conduct product development and underwriting while our program administrator manages a base of over 1,000 retail agents who individually bind policies through PASS or an internal system which automatically applies our pricing and underwriting guidelines to new policies, and is subjected to our disciplined risk management. We have also partnered with several program administrators that focus on specific areas of the E S market as we pursue the growth of PESIC. Carrier Partnerships: Given our unique specialty focus and underwriting expertise, we are a carrier of choice for other insurance companies seeking a specialty insurance partner to act as a fronting carrier, transfer certain classes of risk, satisfy insurance department mandatory offer requirements or provide a more comprehensive risk solution to their customers. As of December 31, 2022, we had partnerships with over 25 insurance companies. Several carriers invite us to provide a companion offer for residential earthquake insurance alongside their homeowners insurance policy offerings. Other carriers will direct their captive agents to our online system so that they may quote, bind and issue policies directly. Finally, we offer assumed reinsurance arrangements to carriers whereby we assume up to 100 of the underlying risk for specific classes of business in exchange for a ceding commission. Our assumed reinsurance treaties represent risks that we would ordinarily underwrite on a primary basis and/or that fit well within our risk tolerance, however, the cedant either (i) has already written these policies or (ii) the cedant wants to issue the policies on its paper but not retain any of the risk and as such prefers an assumed reinsurance partnership. We believe that our carrier partnerships with sophisticated industry participants speak to the value and quality of our products, service offering and systems. Furthermore, carrier partnerships are a highly scalable distribution model as they enable us to tap into a sizable customer base and to quickly build scale in new markets. With all partnerships, we review pricing at the policy level to ensure that the risk characteristics of both new and assumed business are consistent with our underwriting of direct business. We intend to pursue additional carrier partnerships in the future including those that involve PESIC.

 Underwriting Our underwriting team combines comprehensive data analysis with experienced underwriting techniques to build a profitable, stable and diversified book of business. Our underwriting process involves securing an adequate level of underwriting information, classifying and evaluating each individual risk exposure, assessing the impact of the risk upon our existing portfolio, and pricing the risk accordingly. Our overarching underwriting philosophy is to write what we know a straightforward approach that allows our underwriters to focus on business they understand and can process quickly without sacrificing diligence and attention to detail. We develop our underwriting guidelines and pricing models for our property and casualty products through traditional underwriting metrics, management experience, and advanced data analytics. Our underwriters actively collaborate with our actuarial team to determine pricing and risk exposure. This analytical and underwriting expertise framework enables us to offer rate relief in low risk areas and to accurately price risks that are at higher risk. Personal lines policies are issued via automated underwriting and account for approximately 37 of our gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2022. Using our predefined underwriting guidelines, distribution partners can rapidly quote and bind accounts lower in limit via automated processing. We believe that automated underwriting of personal lines policies improves efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances the customer experience. Since property and casualty commercial lines risks involve additional complexity and do not lend themselves to highly automated underwriting, we combine robust risk analysis and data collection with underwriter expertise to evaluate individual risk and to quote business efficiently. We regularly audit data gathered during our underwriting process to determine the accuracy of rating information and risk pricing. For example, we often inspect properties as part of our underwriting process to discover any unrepaired damage and identify any other conditions that affect the insurability of the property. Similarly, our casualty products are subject to extensive risk analysis, including review by experienced underwriters, thorough actuarial review, fostering broker relationships to obtain complete underwriting information, and accurately assessing and quantifying loss exposures to inform pricing, terms and conditions, limits, and attachment points. Our underwriters bring specific line of business experience including underwriting expertise, distribution relationships and support from the reinsurance community while collaborating closely with our actuarial team on pricing. In addition, we continue to pursue the use of technology to streamline inspections and other components of the underwriting process. We apply the same principles and discipline to underwriting when selecting program administrator partners. We proactively engage with our program managers to create specific underwriting guidelines and techniques. We regularly conduct underwriting, claims and financial audits to ensure consistent execution upon underwriting guidelines, claims processing and compliance with regulatory requirements. Ongoing risk management of our portfolio in aggregate is a critical component of our underwriting process. We use third-party catastrophe modeling software to evaluate our ongoing risk exposure. We regularly review the output of these models to evaluate the geographic spread of our risk, including the evaluation of AAL and PML by line of business and for the portfolio as a whole. This review enables us to monitor our exposure to correlated risks and optimize the design and pricing of our reinsurance program including the purchase of appropriate reinsurance coverage. Claims Management Given the low frequency nature of the primary perils that we insure, we primarily outsource our claims handling infrastructure to third-party administrators TPAs to eliminate the expense associated with maintaining full time dedicated claims personnel. We currently contract with multiple TPAs to reduce our reliance on any single TPA, as well as to benefit from expertise of individual vendors in specific lines of business. Our management team is responsible for overseeing our TPAs, including the management of loss reserves, event preparation, settlement, arbitration, and mediation. Claims are reported directly to us and the applicable TPA, which adheres to agreed upon service level standards.

 In the case of a catastrophe event, our technology infrastructure and data analytics enable us to identify potentially affected policies immediately and begin assisting our customers by notifying our TPAs, our reinsurance partners and other potentially impacted parties. Contracting with a network of TPAs improves our ability to mobilize claims adjusters immediately to the areas where our customers are most affected and helps insulate us from the demand surge following a catastrophe event. To prepare for a potential catastrophe event, we run simulations and work closely with our TPAs to ensure there are dedicated desk and field adjusters to handle the volume of claims that would be expected in each loss scenario. Using each earthquake and hurricane scenario, we project losses and identify an individualized and optimal catastrophe response plan for each event. We review claims files and claims reports from our TPAs for accuracy and reasonableness on an ongoing basis. We review all claims received from our TPAs to validate coverage, limits, and deductibles prior to making payment. In addition, we have certain managerial requirements of our TPAs around notification, reserve approval, payment management, correspondence with insureds, and reports for all claims in excess of the claims analyst s authority. We also monitor possible litigation and litigation trends associated with our claims. Reinsurance We purchase a significant amount of reinsurance from third parties that we believe enhances our business by reducing our exposure to potential catastrophe and attritional losses, limiting volatility in our underwriting performance, and providing us with greater visibility into our future earnings. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding, a portion of our risk exposure on policies that we write to another insurer, the reinsurer, in exchange for a premium. We purchase several types of reinsurance, including catastrophe excess of loss XOL ), in which the reinsurer(s) agree to assume all or a portion of losses relating to a group of policies occurring in relation to specified events, subject to customary exclusions, in excess of a specified amount. In addition, we buy reinsurance coverage for specific lines of business on a quota share, property per risk, or a facultative basis. In quota share reinsurance, the reinsurer agrees to assume a specified percentage of the ceding company s losses arising out of a defined class of business in exchange for a corresponding percentage of premiums, net of a ceding commission. Property per risk coverage is similar to catastrophe excess of loss except that the treaty applies in individual property losses rather than in the aggregate for all claims associated with a single catastrophic loss occurrence. Facultative coverage refers to a reinsurance contract on individual risks as opposed to a group or class of business. We use facultative reinsurance selectively to supplement limits or to cover risks or perils excluded from other reinsurance contracts. We have a robust program utilizing a mix of traditional reinsurers and insurance linked securities. We currently purchase reinsurance from over 100 reinsurers, who either have an A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) or better financial strength rating by A.M. Best or post collateral. Our reinsurance contracts include special termination provisions that allow us to cancel and replace any participating reinsurer that is downgraded below a rating of A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) from A.M. Best, or whose surplus drops by more than 20 .

 In addition to reinsurance purchased from traditional reinsurers, we have historically incorporated collateralized protection from the insurance linked securities market via catastrophe bonds. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company closed a 400 million 144A catastrophe bond which became effective June 1, 2021. The catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Pte. Ltd. Torrey Pines Re Pte. ). Torrey Pines Re Pte. is a special purpose reinsurance vehicle incorporated in Singapore that provides Palomar with indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through June 1, 2024. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company also closed a 275 million 144A catastrophe bond which became effective June 1, 2022. This catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled special purpose insurer that provides indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through June 1, 2025. Our largest single XOL reinsurer, excluding Torrey Pines Re, comprises 5.2 of the total catastrophe XOL reinsurance limit we have in effect. The table below reflects the ratings of our largest individual reinsurers.

Our reinsurance coverage exhausts at 2.11 billion for earthquake events, 1.01 billion for Hawaii hurricane events, and 250 million for continental U.S. hurricane events, providing coverage in excess of our 1:250 year peak zone PML and in excess of our A.M. Best threshold. In addition, we maintain reinsurance coverage equivalent to or better than the 1 in 250 year PML for our other lines. As of December 31, 2022, our first event retention represented approximately 3.2 of our stockholders equity. In the event that multiple catastrophe events occur in a period, many of our contracts include the right to reinstate reinsurance limits for potential future recoveries during the same contract year and preserve our limit for subsequent events. This feature for subsequent event coverage is known as a reinstatement. In addition, to provide further coverage against the potential for frequent catastrophe events we have 25 million of aggregate XOL reinsurance limit, which is effective through April 1, 2023. This coverage, applying within our per occurrence retention, has an attachment point of 30 million and applies across all perils including but not limited to earthquakes, hurricanes, convective storms, and floods above a qualifying level of 2.0 million in ultimate gross loss. We believe subsequent event coverage and the aggregate reinsurance cover reduces the volatility of our business and we will always consider the need to protect against subsequent or multiple events in our reinsurance strategy. To assess the sufficiency of our catastrophe XOL reinsurance coverage, we continuously quantify our exposure to catastrophes including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and hailstorms. We evaluate and monitor the total policy limit insured for each peril and in each geographic region, and we use third-party catastrophe models to evaluate the AAL as well as the estimated PML at various intervals. Our PML modeling is consistent with standards established by A.M. Best and includes demand surge, and loss amplification. To protect against model bias, we perform probabilistic modeling as well as deterministic modeling using a variety of industry models including AIR Touchstone for all perils and regions and RMS RiskLink for all perils and regions.

 We believe our current reinsurance program provides coverage well in excess of our theoretical losses from any recorded historical event. The below table shows the PML from selected historical catastrophe events, all of which are less than the amount covered by our current catastrophe reinsurance program. Should an event equivalent to one of these historical events recur, our hypothetical net loss before any tax effect would be capped at our current net retention of 12.5 million.

Best rating of A , if our reinsurers are unable to pay the claims for which they are responsible, we ultimately retain primary liability to our policyholders. In addition, at each reinsurance treaty renewal, we consider any plans to change the underlying insurance coverage we offer, our current capital, our risk appetite, and the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage, which may vary from time to time. Program Specific Reinsurance Coverage In addition to our catastrophe XOL coverage, we purchase reinsurance for specific programs in order to control our net exposure for any single risk, manage our exposure to attritional losses and improve our economics through ceding a portion of the risk to reinsurers in exchange for a ceding commission which generates fee income. We purchase program specific reinsurance, consisting primarily of quota share coverage, for certain lines of business with an attritional loss component such as Inland Marine and Casualty. We also utilize a combination of XOL and quota share reinsurance to provide coverage for our Flood products. Technology Our integrated technology systems form the backbone of our business as they enable us to offer quality and timely service to our policyholders and producers, communicate seamlessly with reinsurers and partner carriers, and run our business more efficiently and cost effectively. As a recently formed insurance company, we have the benefit of having built a proprietary operating platform that employs the best practices of our management team s extensive prior experience and that is not burdened by outdated legacy technology and processes. Our systems offer greater ease of use to distribution partners and provide seamless integration between our pricing models, quoting tools, policy administration systems and portfolio analytics databases. Our proprietary operating platform is based on applications licensed from multiple third-party software vendors. We have invested significantly in customizing, building on top of and extending these applications to increase automation and enhance efficiency. We have dedicated in-house software developers as well as external resources, all of whom report to our Chief Technology Officer. Our internally developed PASS provides producers direct access to our retail and wholesale distributed products including Residential Earthquake, Commercial Earthquake, Hawaii Hurricane, Inland Marine and Residential Flood. PASS also serves as the administration system for select policy data and the access point for business written through direct personal lines partnerships. PASS enables the effective use of predefined underwriting, providing efficiency and optimization to our production partners and real-time transparency in underwriting and aggregate management. Our software development team develops programing interfaces where applicable so that partner carriers and distribution partners can seamlessly access our system.

 Our pricing models are based on the most recent versions of catastrophe models from industry leading vendors and our internal expertise. For certain products where limited models are available, we have worked directly with the vendors to develop proprietary models. We update all of our pricing models as new versions are released, which mitigates our exposure to changes in our business following industry-wide model changes. For personal lines products issued through automated underwriting, our pricing models integrate directly into our policy administration system as well as the systems of program administrator partners. Since our commercial lines products do not lend themselves to highly automated underwriting, we have built a customized operating platform that our underwriters use to evaluate risk and to efficiently quote business. Our custom application platform seamlessly integrates policy administration, billing, and maintenance. We emphasize the use of technology in our analytics and enterprise risk management ERM operations. Our analytics team, which reports to our Chief Risk Officer, uses multiple catastrophe modeling software applications to evaluate our ongoing risk exposure. Our data analytics enable us to provide real-time reporting of our in-force portfolio to our reinsurers, TPAs and distribution partners on a regular basis and during severe weather events. This reporting combines content from the catastrophe models that we license with internally developed content. Event reporting is an element of our overall ERM framework which monitors our risks and ensures that we have appropriate controls and preparations are in place. Our technology infrastructure is designed to function through any major disruption, with all data stored offsite and employees provided with the resources to work remotely. Reserves When a claim is reported to us or when an event occurs, we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate losses under all insurance policies that we underwrite, and loss adjustment expenses relating to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. These reserves include estimates of the cost of the claims reported to us (case reserves) and estimates of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported IBNR and are net of estimated related salvage, subrogation recoverables and reinsurance recoverables. Reserves are estimates involving actuarial projections of the expected ultimate cost to settle and administer claims at a given time, but are not expected to represent precisely the ultimate liability. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Such estimates will also be based on facts and circumstances then known, but are subject to significant uncertainty based on the outcome of various factors, such as future events, future trends in claim severity, inflation and changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage. When a claim is reported and investigated by a claims adjuster, we establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment after an appropriate assessment of coverage, damages and other information as applicable. The estimate is based on general insurance reserving practices and on the claim adjuster s experience and knowledge of the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Case reserves are revised periodically based on subsequent developments associated with each claim. We establish IBNR reserves in accordance with industry practice to provide for (i) the estimated amount of future loss payments on incurred claims not yet reported, and (ii) potential development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are estimated based on generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques that consider quantitative loss experience data and, where appropriate, qualitative factors. We regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques. We also update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and/or settled and new information becomes available. A reserve can be increased or decreased over time as claims move towards settlement, which can impact earnings in the form of either adverse development or reserve releases.

We collect premiums and are required to hold a portion of these funds in reserves until claims are paid. We invest these reserves, primarily in fixed maturity investments. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed by Conning, Inc., an investment advisory firm that is an experienced manager of insurance company assets, and operates under guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. We believe our investment strategy allows us to eliminate the expense of a treasury department while allowing our management to maintain oversight over the investment portfolio. In the years that we make an underwriting profit, we are able to retain all investment income. Underwriting losses may require us to dedicate a portion of our investment income or capital to cover insurance claims and expenses. Our cash and invested assets consist of fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, mutual funds, exchange traded funds and equity securities. Our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on these securities reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Fair value generally represents quoted market value prices for securities traded in the public market or prices analytically determined using bid or closing prices for securities not traded in the public marketplace. Short-term investments are reported at cost and include investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have maturities of 12 months or less upon acquisition by us.

Investment policy is set by our Board of Directors, subject to the limits of applicable regulations. Our investment policy imposes strict requirements for credit quality, with a minimum average credit quality of the portfolio being rated A or higher by Standard Poor s or the equivalent rating from another nationally recognized rating agency. Our investment policy also imposes restrictions on concentrations of securities by class and issuer and any new asset class must be approved by management and our Board of Directors. Given our existing exposure to property values, notably in the state of California, we have imposed restrictions on municipal obligations in the state of California and CMBS single issuers concentrated in the state of California. In addition, we allocate at least 1 of our investment portfolio to investments in green bonds- or fixed income investments tailored towards environmental solutions such as renewable energy, clean transportation, green building, and wastewater treatment a commitment that is consistent with both our investment objectives and our company values. Enterprise Risk Management ERM We maintain a dedicated ERM function that is responsible for analyzing and reporting our risks, monitoring that risks remain within established tolerances, and monitoring, on an ongoing basis, that our ERM objectives are met. These objectives include ensuring proper risk controls are in place, risks are effectively identified, assessed, and managed, and key risks to which we are exposed are appropriately disclosed. Our ERM framework plays an important role in fostering our risk management culture and practices. We continue to enhance our ERM framework, which is guided by the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ORSA model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC and the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST cybersecurity framework. These ongoing enhancements include the creation of an ERM Sub Committee of the Audit Committee of the

Table of Contents 
 Board of Directors which is comprised of executive management and select board members, creation and maintenance of a risk register, and regular reporting on risk management. An additional important part of our ERM is business continuity, including in the circumstances of a catastrophe event. We have established a business continuity team made up of executive management with predefined roles and responsibilities in the event of an emergency response situation and a business continuity communication site where employees are directed to receive instructions that are tailored to various scenarios. We store all data offsite and ensure it is accessible remotely. Our communications, virtual file servers, underwriting and distribution systems, and claims portal are hosted in geographically diverse data centers domestically and globally. We maintain an additional office in Edina, Minnesota to use as a redundant location in the event of a disruptive event in San Diego, and purchase business continuity services to support the La Jolla office in the event of a disruptive event. Environmental, Social and Governance Matters In 2021, our Board of Directors established an Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance ESG Committee which is comprised of various members of our Board. The ESG committee oversees and provides guidance on the company s strategies related to several factors, including environmental, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, governance, sustainability and public policy matters relevant to our business. Specific duties of the ESG committee include: Assisting the management team in setting general strategy relating to ESG matters; Developing, implementing and monitoring initiatives and policies based on that strategy; and Overseeing communications with employees, investors and shareholders with respect to ESG matters. The ESG committee meets on a regular basis to assess progress on ESG matters and will continue to look for opportunities to integrate ESG concerns in our strategy. Environmental and Climate Change Our economic model is closely tied to our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe the existing scientific consensus that man-made changes to climate conditions are leading to increases in sea levels and global temperatures, and that the severity and frequency of weather-related natural disasters may increase relative to historical experience. We believe that this increase in severe weather, coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors that will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, changes to law and regulation related to climate change could also directly affect our business, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses, and possible new requirements that insurers integrate the financial risk of climate change into business operations and governance. From an underwriting standpoint, we carefully consider the development and deployment of insurance products in coastal areas that may be impacted by rising sea levels, and we incorporate scenarios into our catastrophe modeling that involve elevated sea surface temperatures and other relevant data. We are undertaking a third-party audit of the company s carbon footprint, as well as options to mitigate that footprint. Evidence of the Company s commitment to the environment and combating climate change can be found in the Sustainability and Citizenship report available on our corporate website. The company considers ESG factors as part of its investment strategy and reviews individual investments to ensure congruence with company goals in this area. We have also made commitments to automate manual or paper-intensive processes and promote the paperless delivery of documents to our policyholders and producers. We will remain proactive in our efforts to evolve our business in response to our changing natural environment.

 Competition The specialty insurance industry is highly competitive. While we currently target underserved markets, some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources and experience than we do. Our primary competitors include national insurance companies, including American International Group, Inc., Chubb Limited, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. We also compete with the E S market, including Lloyd s of London in some of our lines. In addition, we compete against state or other publicly managed enterprises including the California Earthquake Authority and the National Flood Insurance Program. We may also compete with new market entrants in the future. Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, customer service, relationships with brokers and agents (including ease of doing business, service provided and commission rates paid), size and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. Ratings Each of our insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC and PESIC has a rating of A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) from A.M. Best, which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders. A.M. Best currently assigns 16 ratings to insurance companies, which currently range from A++ (Superior) to S (Rating Suspended). A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) is the fourth highest rating. In evaluating a company s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews the company s profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its loss and loss expense reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, the experience and competence of its management and its market presence. A.M. Best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. These evaluations are not directed to purchasers of an insurance company s securities. Intellectual Property We have registered our logo as a trademark in the United States. We will pursue additional trademark registrations and other intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Human Capital Overview We believe our greatest asset is our talent. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 191 team members. During 2022, our workforce increased by approximately 26 compared to the prior year, and our turnover rate was approximately 14 . Our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented team members. To attract and retain talent, we strive to create a diverse, inclusive, and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our team members to develop in their careers. This is supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our team members and their communities. Diversity and Inclusion We are committed to increasing diversity within our Company. We believe that diversity yields greater creativity and productivity, helps us serve our customers and partners more effectively, and ultimately returns greater value to our shareholders and to the communities in which we do business. We set diversity goals in our annual Sustainability Citizenship report. In 2022, 40 of our team members identify as a member of an ethnic minority group, compared to 39 in 2021, and 50 of our senior executive team identifies as a member of an ethnic minority group. Our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion follows:

INCLUSION Palomar appreciates and takes pride in the active involvement of every team member s unique contribution within a culture that harmonizes our differences. Our team members understand their important contribution to the greater good and understand that what they do makes a difference, both for the company, and in the larger communities we serve. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Palomar s commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion extends into the communities where we conduct business. We believe that every organization, regardless of size or scope, can make a meaningful difference on issues of community welfare, justice, and equality. Through our social, personal, and professional networks, we champion our values and actions. We partner with like-minded organizations to drive action and positive change. EQUALITY Palomar promotes a work environment where individuals are treated fairly, respectfully and have equal access to resources and opportunities for growth. We encourage our teammates to share ideas and collaborate to remove organizational boundaries, solve problems, and drive company growth. Compensation, Health and Well Being We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits to support our team members overall well-being. Our compensation programs include base pay, annual incentive compensation and, in many cases, long-term equity-based compensation. In 2022, 100 of our workforce received equity awards. We offer team members a comprehensive and leading benefits program that includes a holistic approach to health and wellness. We regularly benchmark programs to ensure our team has access to industry-leading benefits to address all aspects of well-being physical and mental health, family care, financial support, and community engagement. In our initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed many of our team members to work from home since March 2020. As the pandemic began to ease, we began allowing all employees to return to our offices on a voluntary basis, with established protocols to ensure operational reliability and employee safety. As a result of the continued progress made against the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning the first quarter of 2023, we have established a return-to-office policy under which employees located near Palomar offices have a goal to work onsite a minimum of ten days per month. We continue to provide team members a reimbursement to help manage incremental costs associated with remote work. We also regularly check-in with team members to assess their mental health. Team members receive 24/7 access to behavioral health tools and resources and a company paid subscription to Headspace, a meditation and wellness application. Effective January 1, 2023, the state of California will implement pay transparency legislation. To comply with this legislation, we intend to include base pay ranges in all our job listings. Additionally, we will voluntarily disclose our base pay ranges to all our internal employees for the roles they hold in alignment with our philosophy of pay transparency. Talent Development We provide numerous training opportunities for our team members, with a focus on personal and professional development. We utilize Coaching for Performance methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. Our talent development programs provide team members resources to achieve career goals and build leadership skills. We encourage all team members to take advantage of company supported learning opportunities that help broaden industry and functional knowledge to help them excel in their current roles as well as advance their overall career objectives. In 2022, our team members completed approximately 2,903 hours of training. We believe in the dynamic allocation of talent, and therefore we encourage interested team members to explore functions outside their current role. To support this belief, we provide a 3,000 tuition and/or certification reimbursement for ongoing development. Lastly, we have a methodical approach to talent development, offering organizational advancement and

 Item 1A. Risk Factors A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. Summary Risk Factors Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, these risks include, but are not limited to, the following: Risks related to our business and industry: Claims arising from unpredictable and severe catastrophe events, including those caused by global climate change, could reduce or eliminate our earnings and stockholders equity, and limit our ability to underwrite new insurance policies; Our reinsurers may not pay claims on a timely basis, or at all, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations; Our loss reserves are established based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover actual incurred losses which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; The inability to purchase third-party reinsurance or otherwise expand our catastrophe coverage in amounts we desire on commercially acceptable terms or on terms that adequately protect us; Our risk management and loss limitation methods, including estimates and models, may fail to adequately manage our exposure to losses from catastrophe events and our losses could be materially higher than our expectations; We and our customers could be negatively and adversely impacted by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; Our business is concentrated in California and Texas and we are exposed more significantly to California and Texas loss activity and regulatory environments; We rely on a select group of brokers and program administrators to manage the distribution of a significant portion of our Residential Earthquake, Commercial Earthquake, Hawaii Hurricane, and Fronting products. Two program administrators account for a significant portion of our premiums and such relationships may not continue; There is intense competition for business in our industry; 
 Risks Related to the Economic Environment: Adverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity could affect our growth and profitability; 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 Risks Related to Technology: The failure of our information technology and telecommunications systems could adversely affect our business; Security breaches or cyber-attacks could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and business; 
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations: We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives; Unexpected changes in the interpretation of our coverage or provisions, including loss limitations and exclusions, in our policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations; We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations; and 
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock: Our operating results and stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose all or part of their investment. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Claims arising from unpredictable and severe catastrophe events, including those caused by global climate change, could reduce or eliminate our earnings and stockholders equity and limit our ability to underwrite new insurance policies. Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising from unpredictable catastrophe events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, floods and other severe events. Furthermore, the actual occurrence, frequency and magnitude of such events are uncertain. While there can be no certainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of earthquakes, some observers believe that significant shifts in the tectonic plates, including the San Andreas Fault, may occur in the future. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world, including the markets in which we operate. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. This effect has led to conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, including warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear that increase hurricane activity. Hurricane activity typically increases between June and November of each year, though the actual occurrence and magnitude of such events is uncertain. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophe loss could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, any increased frequency and severity of such weather events, including hurricanes, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to predict, quantify, reinsure and manage catastrophe risk and may materially increase our losses resulting from such catastrophe events. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the frequency and severity of the insured events and the total amount of insured exposure in the areas affected. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and the occurrence of one catastrophe does not make the occurrence of another catastrophe more or less likely. Increases in the replacement cost of insured property due to higher material and labor costs, increases in concentrations of insured property, the effects of inflation, and changes in cyclical weather patterns may increase the severity of claims from catastrophe events in the future. Claims from catastrophe events could reduce our earnings and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, possibly to the extent of eliminating our total stockholders equity. We experienced significant catastrophe losses including hurricane related losses during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and third quarters of 2021 and 2022. Our ability to underwrite new insurance policies could also be materially adversely impacted 
 26

 as a result of corresponding reductions in our capital. In addition, a natural disaster could materially impact the financial condition of our policyholders, resulting in loss of premiums. Our catastrophe event retention is currently 12.5 million for all perils. Our reinsurance coverage exhausts at 2.11 billion for earthquake events, 1.01 billion for Hawaii hurricane events, and 250 million for continental U.S. hurricane events, with coverage in excess of our estimated peak zone 1 in 250 year PML event and in excess of our A.M. Best threshold. In addition to our event retention, we may also incur additional reinsurance expenses upon a catastrophe event. While we only select reinsurers whom we believe to have acceptable credit, if our reinsurers are unable to pay the claims for which they are responsible, we ultimately retain primary liability. Furthermore, our earthquake policies do not provide coverage for fire damage arising from an earthquake. While we believe this risk transfer program reduces volatility in our earnings, one or more severe catastrophe events could result in claims that substantially exceed the limits of our reinsurance coverage. Furthermore, catastrophe events which cause our reinsurers to incur losses may increase the cost of reinsurance in future periods or make it more difficult to obtain reinsurance on commercially acceptable terms. Our reinsurers may not pay claims on a timely basis, or at all, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to grow our business is dependent in part in our ability to secure reinsurance for a substantial portion of the risk associated with our policies. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the ceding insurer) of our primary liability to our policyholders. While our current reinsurance program is designed to limit our risk retention, in the event of a major catastrophe, our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all these claims. In addition, reinsurers may default in their financial obligations to us as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud, asserted defenses based on agreement wordings or the principle of utmost good faith, asserted deficiencies in the documentation of agreements or other reasons. Any disputes with reinsurers regarding coverage under reinsurance contracts could be time consuming, costly, and uncertain of success. If a catastrophic event were to occur and our reinsurers were unable to satisfy their commitments to us, we may be unable to satisfy the liability to our policyholders. We evaluate each reinsurance claim based on the facts of the case, historical experience with the reinsurer on similar claims and existing case law and consider including any amounts deemed uncollectible from the reinsurer in a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance. As of December 31, 2022, we had 193.6 million of aggregate reinsurance recoverables. These risks could cause us to incur increased net losses, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition. Our loss reserves are established based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover actual incurred losses which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date. We seek to establish adequate reserves; however, our ultimate liability may be greater than our estimate. The process of estimating the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses requires a high degree of judgment and is subject to several variables. Multiple actuarial methods are used to estimate the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. These methods utilize, to varying degrees, the initial expected loss ratio, detailed statistical analysis of past claims reporting and payment patterns, claims frequency and severity, paid loss experience, industry loss experience, and changes in market conditions, policy forms, exclusions, and exposures. We are subject to uncertainties which impact the adequacy of our reserves. For example, when we write occurrence policies, we are obligated to pay covered claims, up to the contractually agreed amount, for any covered loss that occurs while the policy is in force. Accordingly, claims may arise in years after a policy has lapsed. In addition, catastrophe events often involve a significant number of claims and ultimate cost of settling all claims is inherently difficult to predict upon the event s occurrence.

 Our reserves are driven by several important factors, including litigation and regulatory trends, legislative activity, climate change, social and economic patterns and claims inflation assumptions. Our reserve estimates reflect current inflation in legal claims settlements and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. The impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific, significant new regulation or legislation. In the event of significant new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business, but no assurance can be given that our attempt to quantify such inputs will be accurate or successful. If our loss reserves should prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase our reserves resulting in a reduction in our net income and stockholders equity in the period where the inadequacy is identified. Material increases to our reserves may impact our liquidity, our financial rating, and our ability to comply with debt covenants. For further information on our loss reserving methodology, see Management s Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates- Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . We may be unable to purchase third-party reinsurance or otherwise expand our catastrophe coverage in amounts we desire on commercially acceptable terms or on terms that adequately protect us, and this inability may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase a significant amount of reinsurance from third parties that we believe enhances our business by reducing our exposure to potential catastrophe losses and reducing volatility in our underwriting performance, providing us with greater visibility into our future earnings. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding, a portion of our risk exposure on policies that we write to another insurer, the reinsurer, in exchange for a premium. We primarily use treaty reinsurance, consisting of excess of loss XOL coverage. Additionally, we buy program specific reinsurance coverage on a quota share, property per risk or a facultative basis. Treaty coverage refers to a reinsurance contract that is applied to a group or class of business where all the risks written meet the criteria for that class. Facultative coverage refers to a reinsurance contract on individual risks as opposed to a group or class of business. Our catastrophe XOL treaties are divided into multiple layers. The reinsurance market historically has been a cyclical market characterized by periods of sufficient or excess capital (soft market cycle) as well as shortages of capital (hard market cycle). Market conditions have limited, and in some cases prevented, insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance they consider adequate for their business needs. As a result, we may not be able to purchase reinsurance in the areas and for the amounts we desire or on terms we deem acceptable or at all. A hard market cycle may increase our cost of reinsurance, force us to increase our loss retention, or limit the amount of reinsurance we are able to purchase, all of which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition to reinsurance purchased from traditional reinsurers, we have historically incorporated collateralized protection from the insurance linked securities market via catastrophe bonds. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company closed a 400 million 144A catastrophe bond which became effective June 1, 2021. The catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Pte. Ltd. Torrey Pines Re Pte. ). Torrey Pines Re Pte. is a special purpose reinsurance vehicle incorporated in Singapore that provides Palomar with indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through June 1, 2024. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company also closed a 275 million 144A catastrophe bond which became effective June 1, 2022. This catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled special purpose insurer that provides indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through June 1, 2025. We may seek similar catastrophe bond offerings in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such offerings on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to renew our expiring reinsurance contracts on acceptable terms or expand our reinsurance coverage through traditional reinsurers, catastrophe bonds, or otherwise, our loss exposure could increase, which would increase our potential losses related to catastrophe or non-catastrophe events. If we are unwilling to bear an increase in

 loss exposure, we could have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, both of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as we grow our written premiums and enter new lines of business we will seek out new types of reinsurance and will need to purchase reinsurance on commercially acceptable terms in order to reduce the risk associated with entering new lines of business. The inability to purchase appropriate reinsurance for new lines of business would have a negative impact on our ability to grow our written premiums and maintain our current level of profitability. Many reinsurance companies have begun to exclude certain coverages from, or alter terms in, our reinsurance contracts with them. As a result, we, like other insurance companies, write insurance policies which to some extent do not have the benefit of reinsurance protection. These gaps in reinsurance protection expose us to greater risk and greater potential losses. We utilize several risk management and loss limitation methods, including relying on estimates and models. If these methods fail to adequately manage our exposure to losses from catastrophe events, our losses could be materially higher than our expectations, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our approach to risk management relies on subjective variables that entail significant uncertainties. We manage our exposure to catastrophe losses by analyzing the probability of the occurrence of catastrophe events and their severity and overall impact on our underwriting and investment portfolio. We monitor and mitigate our exposure through a number of methods designed to minimize risk, including underwriting specialization, modeling and data systems, data quality control, strategic use of policy deductibles and regular review of aggregate exposure and probable maximum loss reports, which report the maximum amount of losses that one would expect based on computer or actuarial modeling techniques. These estimates, models, data, and scenarios may not produce accurate predictions; consequently, we could incur losses both in the risks we underwrite and to the value of our investment portfolio due to the overall impact on financial markets from the occurrence of catastrophe events. In addition, output from our risk modeling software is based on third-party data that we believe to be accurate and reliable. The estimates and assumptions we use are dependent on many variables, such as loss adjustment expenses, insurance to value, storm or earthquake intensity, building code compliance and demand surge, which is the temporary inflation of costs for building materials such as lumber and labor resulting from increased demand for rebuilding services in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Accordingly, if the estimates and assumptions used in our risk models are incorrect or if our risk models prove to be an inaccurate forecasting tool, the losses we might incur from an actual catastrophe could be materially higher than our expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our third-party data providers may change the estimates or assumptions that we use in our risk models and/or their data may be inaccurate. Changes in these estimates or assumptions or the use of inaccurate third-party data could cause our actual losses to be materially higher than our current expectation of losses generated by modeled catastrophe scenarios, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We run many model simulations to understand the impact of these assumptions on a catastrophe s loss potential. Furthermore, there are risks associated with catastrophe events, which are either poorly represented or not represented at all by catastrophe models. Each modeling assumption or un-modeled risk introduces uncertainty into probable maximum loss estimates that management must consider. These uncertainties can include, but are not limited to, the following: The models do not address all the possible hazard characteristics of a catastrophe peril (e.g., the precise path and wind speed of a hurricane); 
 The models may not accurately reflect the true frequency or severity of events; The models may not accurately reflect a risk s vulnerability or susceptibility to damage for a given event characteristic; 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 The models may not account for unusual or unprecedented catastrophe events; The models may not adequately consider the impact of current inflation on the magnitude of modeled losses; 
 The models may not accurately represent loss potential to insurance or reinsurance contract coverage limits, terms and conditions; and The models may not accurately reflect the impact on the economy of the area affected or the financial, judicial, political, or regulatory impacts on insurance claim payments during or following a catastrophe event. As a result of these factors and contingencies, our reliance on assumptions and data used to evaluate our entire risk portfolio and specifically to estimate a probable maximum loss is subject to a high degree of uncertainty that could result in actual losses that are materially different from our probable maximum loss estimates and could adversely impact our financial results. A decline in our financial strength rating may adversely affect the amount of business we write and impact compliance with our debt covenants. Participants in the insurance industry use ratings from independent ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best, as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. In setting its ratings, A.M. Best performs quantitative and qualitative analysis of a company s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. A.M. Best financial strength ratings range from A++ (Superior) to F for insurance companies that have been publicly placed in liquidation. As of December 31, 2022, A.M. Best has assigned a financial strength rating of A (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) to our insurance company subsidiaries, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company PSIC and Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company PESIC ). A.M. Best assigns ratings that are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurance company s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and such ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common stock or any other securities we may issue. A.M. Best s analysis includes comparisons to peers and industry standards as well as assessments of operating plans, philosophy and management. A.M. Best periodically reviews our financial strength rating and may revise it downward or revoke it at A.M. Best s discretion based primarily on its analyses of our balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy), operating performance and business profile. Factors that could affect such analyses include, but are not limited to: If we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports A.M. Best s rating; If unfavorable financial, regulatory or market trends affect us, including excess market capacity; If our losses exceed our loss reserves; If we have unresolved issues with government regulators; If we are unable to retain our senior management or other key personnel; If our investment portfolio incurs significant losses; or If A.M. Best alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect our rating. These and other factors could result in a downgrade of our financial strength rating. A downgrade or withdrawal of our rating could result in any of the following consequences, among others: 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 Causing our current and future distribution partners and insureds to choose other, more highly-rated competitors; Increasing the cost or reducing the availability of reinsurance to us; Severely limiting or preventing us from writing new and renewal insurance contracts; or Causing us to be out of compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement. In addition, in view of the earnings and capital pressures experienced by many financial institutions, including insurance companies, it is possible that rating organizations will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, will increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will request additional information from the companies that they rate or will increase the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. If our credit rating were to be downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our access to capital markets and the cost of any equity or debt financing will be negatively impacted. We can offer no assurance that our rating will remain at its current level. It is possible that such reviews of us may result in adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We and our customers could be negatively and adversely impacted by pandemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted financial markets, businesses, households, and communities. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 or another similar event on our operational and financial performance depends on several factors, including the ultimate duration and severity of the event, the emergence and severity of variant strains, actions taken and restrictions imposed by the government and health officials in response, the effectiveness and adoption of vaccines and therapeutics, the ability for our customers to continue to pay premiums, contraction of the insurance and reinsurance markets, and the ability for reinsurers to satisfy claims, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. While policy terms and conditions in the lines of business written by us would be expected to preclude coverage for virus-related claims, court decisions and governmental actions may challenge the validity of any exclusions or our interpretation of how such terms and conditions operate. Pandemics have historically contributed to financial market volatility, supply chain disruptions, price inflation, and material and labor shortages, all of which may have a negative impact on our business. Furthermore, since our results of operations are partially dependent on the performance of our investment portfolio, a pandemic s impact on the economy and financial markets could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses in future periods. The macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic may persist for an indefinite period, even after the Pandemic has subsided. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which COVID-19 or other similar global health crises could adversely impact our business in the future. Our business is concentrated in California and Texas and, as a result, we are exposed more significantly to California and Texas loss activity and regulatory environments. Our policyholders and insurance risks are currently concentrated in California and Texas, which generated 46 and 12 of our gross written premiums, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 47 and 10 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We are exposed to business, economic, political, judicial and regulatory risks due to this concentration that are greater than the risks faced by insurance companies that conduct business over a more extensive geographic area. Any single, major catastrophe event, series of events or other condition causing significant losses in California or Texas could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in these states may result in a significant reduction of our premiums or increase our loss exposure. Changes in California or Texas political climates could result in new or changed legislation affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general which could have a negative impact on our business.

 We could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel and seasoned key executives who are knowledgeable about our business. The pool of talent from which we actively recruit is limited and may fluctuate based on market dynamics specific to our industry and independent of overall economic conditions. As such, higher demand for employees having the desired skills and expertise could lead to increased compensation expectations for existing and prospective personnel, making it difficult for us to retain and recruit key personnel and maintain labor costs at desired levels. Recently, companies have had issues with employee turnover and finding, hiring, and retaining qualified employees. These challenges may continue for the foreseeable future. In particular, our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mac Armstrong, and our Chief Financial Officer, Christopher Uchida. Should any of our key executives terminate their employment with us, or if we are unable to retain and attract talented personnel, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We rely on a select group of brokers and program administrators, and such relationships may not continue. The distribution networks of our products are multi-faceted and distinct to each line of business. Our relationship with our brokers or program administrators may be discontinued at any time. Even if the relationships do continue, they may not be on terms that are profitable for us. We distribute a significant portion of our Residential Earthquake, Commercial Earthquake, Hawaii Hurricane, and Fronting products through relationships with two program administrators. Each of the products managed by the program administrators operates as a separate program that is governed by an independent, separately negotiated agreement with unique terms and conditions, including geographic scope, key person provisions, economics and exclusivity. These programs also feature separate managerial oversight and leadership, policy administration systems and retail agents originating policies. These products accounted for 266.2 million or 50 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2021, with 10.3 million or 2 of the total attributable to fronting premiums. These products accounted for 417.5 million or 47 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022, with 129.3 million or 15 of the total attributable to fronting premiums. This amount includes our Value Select Residential Earthquake program, which represents the majority of our Residential Earthquake premium and is administered through a mutually exclusive program administrator agreement with Arrowhead General Insurance Agency for the states of California, Oregon and Washington. The agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party for cause. The termination of a relationship with one or more significant brokers or program administrators could result in lower gross written premiums and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business prospects. Because we provide our program administrators with specific quoting and binding authority, if any of them fail to comply with pre-established guidelines, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We market and distribute certain of our insurance products through program administrators that have limited quoting and binding authority and that in turn sell our insurance products to insureds through retail agents and wholesale brokers. These program administrators can bind certain risks without our expressed approval. If any of these program administrators fail to comply with our underwriting guidelines and the terms of their appointments, we could be bound on a particular risk or number of risks that were not anticipated when we developed the insurance products or estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses. Such actions could adversely affect our results of operations. Because our business depends on insurance brokers and program administrators, we are exposed to certain risks arising out of our reliance on these distribution channels that could adversely affect our results. Certain premiums from policyholders, where the business is produced by brokers, are collected directly by the brokers and forwarded to our insurance subsidiaries. In certain jurisdictions, when the insured pays its policy premium to 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 its broker for payment to us, the premium might be considered to have been paid under applicable insurance laws and regulations. Accordingly, the insured would no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premium from the broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers with which we work. We review the financial condition of potential new brokers before we agree to transact business with them. Although the failure by any of our brokers to remit premiums to us has not been material to date, there may be instances where our brokers collect premiums but do not remit them to us and we may be required under applicable law to provide the coverage set forth in the policy despite the related premiums not being paid to us. Additionally, the loss or disruption of business from our agents and brokers or the failure or inability of these agents and brokers to successfully market our insurance products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because the possibility of these events occurring depends in large part upon the financial condition and internal operations of our brokers, we regularly meet and communicate with our brokers, monitor broker behavior, and review broker financial information on an as-needed basis. If we are unable to collect premiums from our brokers in the future, our underwriting profits may decline, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Competition for business in our industry is intense. We face competition from other specialty insurance companies, standard insurance companies and underwriting agencies that are larger than we are and that have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some of these competitors also have longer operating history and more market recognition than we do in certain lines of business. In addition, we compete against state or other publicly managed enterprises including the California Earthquake Authority CEA ), the National Flood Insurance Program, and the Texas Wind Insurance Association. If the CEA decided to provide coverage to non-CEA member carriers or lessened the capital requirements for membership, we would face additional competition in our markets, and our operating results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, it may be difficult or prohibitively expensive for us to implement technology systems and processes that are competitive with the systems and processes of these larger companies. Competition in the insurance industry is based on many factors, including price of coverage, the general reputation and perceived financial strength of the company, relationships with brokers, terms and conditions of products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment, and the experience and reputation of the members of our underwriting team in the particular lines of insurance and reinsurance we seek to underwrite. In recent years, the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation, which may further increase competition. Certain new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry. For example, there has been an increase in capital-raising by companies with whom we compete, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry. Additionally, the possibility of federal regulatory reform of the insurance industry could increase competition from standard carriers. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully in the insurance markets. Increased competition in these markets could result in a change in the supply and demand for insurance, affect our ability to price our products at risk-adequate rates and retain existing business, or underwrite new business on favorable terms. If this increased competition so limits our ability to transact business, our operating results could be adversely affected. If actual renewals of our existing policies do not meet expectations, our written premium in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Most of our insurance policies are written for a one- year term. In our financial forecasting process, we make assumptions about the rates of renewal of our prior year s policies. The insurance and reinsurance industries have historically been cyclical businesses with intense competition, often based on price. If actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write a renewal because of pricing conditions, our written premium in future years and our future operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, the volume of fronting premiums written 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 may vary significantly in future periods due to the timing of entering large fronting partnerships and terminations of large fronting partnerships. Our failure to accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, including our third-party claims administrators TPAs ), the effectiveness of our management, and our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to evaluate and pay claims accurately and timely could lead to regulatory and administrative actions or material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, if we do not manage our TPAs effectively, or if our TPAs are unable to effectively handle our volume of claims, our ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations. We may act based on inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the accounts we underwrite. We rely on information provided by insureds or their representatives when underwriting insurance policies. While we may make inquiries and take other steps to validate or supplement the information provided, we may make underwriting decisions based on incorrect or incomplete information. It is possible that we will misunderstand the nature or extent of the activities or facilities and the corresponding extent of the risks that we insure because of our reliance on inadequate or inaccurate information. We may change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without stockholder approval. Our management has the authority to change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without notice to our stockholders and without stockholder approval. As a result, we may make fundamental changes to our operations without stockholder approval, which could result in our pursuing a strategy or implementing underwriting guidelines that may be materially different from the strategy or underwriting guidelines described in our public filings. Our employees could take excessive risks, which could negatively affect our financial condition and business. As an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of binding certain risks. The employees who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, underwriters, product managers and other employees, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our employees incentives to take excessive risks. Employees may, however, take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor employees business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our employees take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including our growth rate and profitability, our claims experience, the availability of reinsurance, market disruptions, and other unforeseeable developments. If we need to raise additional 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result. In the case of debt financings, we would be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our operating plans and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively. We intend to grow our business in the future, which could require additional capital, technology development, and skilled personnel. To grow effectively, we must be able to meet our capital needs and expand our systems, technology, and internal controls effectively. We also must allocate our human resources optimally, including identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified employees, and effectively incorporating the components of any businesses we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. The failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results have in the past varied from quarter to quarter and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects. Our operating results are subject to fluctuation and have historically varied from quarter to quarter. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the general economic conditions in the markets where we operate, the frequency of occurrence and severity of catastrophe or other insured events, fluctuating interest rates, claims exceeding our loss reserves, competition in our industry, deviations from expected premium retention rates of our existing policies and contracts, volatility in investment performance and gains and losses on our equity securities, and the cost of reinsurance coverage. In addition, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity (soft market cycle) as well as periods when shortages of capacity increase premium levels (hard market cycle). We expect our business and results of operations to be continuously impacted by these market cycles. We seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable returns on tangible stockholders equity over the long term. Our opportunistic nature and focus on long-term growth in tangible equity may result in fluctuations in gross written premiums, reinsurance expenses, loss expenses, and other underwriting expenses from period to period as we concentrate on underwriting contracts that we believe will generate better long-term, rather than short-term, results. Accordingly, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects. Our Credit Agreement contains restrictions and covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and any debt borrowed under our Credit Agreement exposes us to additional risk and may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. In December 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with certain lenders which provides a revolving credit facility of up to 100.0 million. Currently, we have no borrowings under the Credit Agreement. If we make borrowings in the future, it may impact our business and financial condition by: Requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including investing, and paying claims and operating expenses and; Exposing us to interest rate risk since the interest rate in the credit agreement is a variable rate In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions. The financial covenants in the Credit agreement require the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum net worth at the end of each quarter. The Company s insurance subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum Risk 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 Based Capital Ratio at the end of each year and must always maintain a minimum AM Best Financial Strength rating. All of these covenants and restrictions impact how we operate our business and may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Risks related to the Economic Environment Adverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity could result in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in the frequency of claims and premium defaults, and even the falsification of claims, or a combination of these effects, which, in turn, could affect our growth and profitability. Factors, such as general economic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation can affect the business and economic environment. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment, declining spending, and reduced corporate revenue, the demand for insurance products is generally adversely affected, which directly affects our premium levels and profitability. Negative economic factors may also affect our ability to receive the appropriate rate for the risk we insure with our policyholders and may adversely affect the number of policies we can write, and our opportunities to underwrite profitable business. In an economic downturn, our customers may have less need for insurance coverage, cancel or cease payment on existing insurance policies, modify their coverage, or not renew the policies they hold with us. Existing policyholders may exaggerate or even falsify claims to obtain higher claims payments. These outcomes would reduce our underwriting profit to the extent these factors are not reflected in the rates we charge. We underwrite a significant portion of our insurance in California and Texas. An economic downturn which particularly impacts either state could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. We seek to hold a diversified portfolio of investments that is managed by a professional investment advisory management firm in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by our Board of Directors. Our investments are subject to general economic conditions and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities. Our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in interest rates and credit quality considerations. Future increases in interest rates could cause the values of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to decline, with the magnitude of the decline depending on the duration of securities included in our portfolio and the amount by which interest rates increase. Some fixed maturity securities have call or prepayment options, which create possible reinvestment risk in declining rate environments. Other fixed maturity securities, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk or, in a rising interest rate environment, may not prepay as quickly as expected. The value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities we hold, or due to deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer s payments on such investments. Downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities also have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities. Such factors could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. Our investment portfolio is subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 (i.e., the carrying amount) of the securities we hold in our portfolio does not reflect prices at which actual transactions would occur. We also invest in marketable equity securities. These securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value and are subject to potential losses and declines in market value based on the performance of equity markets. Our equity invested assets totaled 38.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Risks for all types of securities are managed through the application of our investment policy, which establishes investment parameters that include but are not limited to, maximum percentages of investment in certain types of securities and minimum levels of credit quality, which we believe are within applicable guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC ), the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation and the California and Arizona Departments of Insurance. Although we seek to preserve our capital, we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. In addition, although we seek to employ investment strategies that are not correlated with our insurance and reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate the adverse effect of the losses on us. Our investment portfolio could also be adversely impacted by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread widenings caused by economic downturns or other events. Severe economic downturns could cause impairments in our fixed income portfolio. In addition, declines in fixed income yields would result in decreases in net investment income from future investment activity, including re-investments. We could be forced to sell investments to meet our liquidity requirements. We invest the premiums we receive from our insureds until they are needed to pay policyholder claims. Consequently, we seek to manage the duration of our investment portfolio based on the duration of our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves to provide sufficient liquidity and avoid having to liquidate investments to fund claims. Risks such as inadequate losses and loss adjustment reserves or unfavorable trends in litigation could potentially result in the need to sell investments to fund these liabilities. We may not be able to sell our investments at favorable prices or at all. Sales could result in significant realized losses depending on the conditions of the general market, interest rates, and credit issues with individual securities. Risks related to Technology The failure of our information technology and telecommunications systems could adversely affect our business. Our business is highly dependent upon our information technology and telecommunications systems, including our underwriting system. We rely on these systems to interact with brokers and insureds, to underwrite business, to prepare policies and process premiums, to perform actuarial and other modeling functions, to process claims and make claims payments, and to prepare internal and external financial statements and information. Some of these systems may include or rely on third-party systems not located on our premises or under our control. Events such as natural catastrophes, pandemics, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, industrial accidents or computer viruses may cause our systems to fail or be inaccessible for extended periods of time. While we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable plans to protect our systems, sustained or repeated system failures or service denials could severely limit our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or otherwise operate in the ordinary course of business. A significant portion of our employees work remotely and outside of our primary offices on a regular basis. We believe remote work increases the need for our information technology and telecommunications systems to work properly and creates additional operational risk and difficulty should these systems fail.

 Security breaches or cyber-attacks could expose the Company to liability and damage its reputation and business. Our operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other data and information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct, and other external hazards could expose our systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against them. In addition, cyber-attackers (which may include individuals or groups, as well as sophisticated groups such as nation-state and state-sponsored attackers, which can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits) also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, information systems or networks. Outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. While we have implemented security measures and employee training designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks, our systems and networks may be, and at times are, subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers data and information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisors, reputational harm or other damage to our business. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. In addition, the trend toward general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business. We employ third-party licensed software for use in our business, and the inability to maintain these licenses, problems with the software we license, or increases to the cost of software licenses could adversely affect our business. Multiple areas of our business rely on certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third- party software in the future. Unforeseen issues may arise in third-party software platforms which may have an adverse impact on our operations. Integration of new third-party software or modifications to our existing third-party software may require substantial investment of our time and resources. The inability to integrate or operate third-party software successfully or the inadequacy of third-party software may have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the cost of third-party software is significant and we expect it to increase in the future. If we have issues with the functionality or expense of third-party software, we may not be able to find acceptable alternatives in a timely manner or at all. Many of the risks associated with the use of third-party software cannot be eliminated, and these risks could negatively affect our business. Additionally, the software powering our technology systems incorporates software covered by open-source licenses. The terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our systems. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open-source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code or re-engineer all or a portion of our technology systems, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technology systems. Such risk could be difficult or impossible to eliminate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 Any cloud provider service failure or control weakness could adversely affect our business. We employ cloud-based services to host our applications and intend to expand our use. As we expand our use of cloud-based services, we will increasingly rely on third-party cloud providers to maintain appropriate controls and safeguards to protect confidential information we receive, including personal, personally identifiable, sensitive, confidential or proprietary data, and the integrity and continuous operation of our proprietary technology platform. While we conduct due diligence on these cloud providers with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the visibility to effectively monitor the implementation and efficacy of these controls. Outside parties may be able to circumvent controls or exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in operational disruption, data loss, defects or a security event. Migrating to the cloud increases the risk of operational disruption should internet service be interrupted. While we have implemented business contingency and other plans to facilitate continuous internet access, sustained or concurrent service denials or similar failures could limit our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or otherwise operate our business. Any such event or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations We are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. PSIC is subject to extensive regulation in Oregon, its state of domicile, California, where it is commercially domiciled, and to a lesser degree, the other states in which it operates. PESIC is subject to extensive regulation in Arizona, its state of domicile, and to a lesser degree, the other states in which it writes business. Our Bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary, Palomar Specialty Reinsurance Company Bermuda Ltd. PSRE ), is subject to regulation in Bermuda. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of investors or stockholders. These regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, capital and surplus requirements, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions, dividend limitations, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non-financial aspects of our business. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could further limit our discretion or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance regulators and the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA ), also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance and reinsurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may impose timing and expense constraints that could adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all our business objectives. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are part of an insurance holding company system within the meaning of applicable California, Oregon and Arizona statutes and regulations. As a result of such status, certain transactions between our U.S. insurance subsidiaries and one or more of their affiliates, such as a tax sharing agreement or cost sharing arrangement, may not be effected unless the insurer has provided notice of that transaction to the California Department of Insurance, the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, or the Arizona Department of Insurance, as applicable, at least 30 days prior to engaging in the transaction and the California Department of Insurance, the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, or the Arizona Department of Insurance, as applicable, has not disapproved such transaction within the 30-day time period. These prior notification requirements may result in business delays and additional business expenses. If any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries fail to file a required notification or fail to comply with other applicable insurance regulations in California, Oregon or Arizona, as applicable, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties and our working relationship with the California Department of Insurance, the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, or the Arizona Department of Insurance, as applicable, may be impaired.

 In addition, state insurance regulators have broad discretion to deny, suspend, or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or could otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could interfere with our operations and require us to bear additional costs of compliance, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements, based upon the risk based capital model adopted by the NAIC, and other minimum capital and surplus restrictions imposed under Arizona, Oregon and California law. These requirements establish the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure by any of our U.S. subsidiaries to maintain risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect their ability to maintain regulatory authority to conduct business. PSRE is subject to regulation from the European Union. The European Union adopted the Economic Substance Act 2018 and the Economic Substance Regulations 2018 (together, the ES Requirements ). As an insurance company, our Bermuda subsidiary conducts a relevant activity and will be subject to the ES Requirements. As a result, our Bermuda subsidiary may be required to change or increase our business operations in Bermuda to meet the new requirements. Compliance with the ES Requirements is required with effect from July 1, 2019. Unexpected changes in the interpretation of our coverage or provisions, including loss limitations and exclusions, in our policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that specifically negotiated loss limitations or exclusions in our policies will be enforceable in the manner we intend. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. For example, many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim, which may be shorter than the statutory period under which such claims can be brought against our policyholders. While these limitations and exclusions help us assess and mitigate our loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority or an executive action could nullify or void a limitation or exclusion, such as limitations on business interruption claims caused by pandemics or other crises, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such limitations or exclusions. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, court decisions, such as the 1995 Montrose decision in California could read policy exclusions narrowly so as to expand coverage, thereby requiring insurers to create and write new exclusions. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. We may become subject to additional government or market regulation, including additional regulation around cyber-attacks, which may have a material adverse impact on our business. Our business could be adversely affected by changes in state laws, including those relating to asset and reserve valuation requirements, surplus requirements, limitations on investments and dividends, enterprise risk and risk-based capital requirements, and, at the federal level, by laws and regulations that may affect certain aspects of the insurance industry, including proposals for preemptive federal regulation. The U.S. federal government generally has not directly 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies. In addition, the Bermuda reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions. As a result, the BMA has implemented and imposed additional requirements on the companies it regulates, which requirements could adversely impact the operations of PSRE. Any government mandates and/or legislative changes related to COVID-19 or other events, including mandated premium refunds or credits and extended premium grace periods, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Premium grace periods could significantly increase our expenses while decreasing our short-term revenues which would adversely impact our liquidity. Additionally, in response to the growing threat of cyber-attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions have begun to consider new cybersecurity measures, including the adoption of cybersecurity regulations which, among other things, would require insurance companies to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program and implement and maintain cybersecurity policies and procedures. On October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted its Insurance Data Security Model Law, intended to serve as model legislation for states to enact in order to govern cybersecurity and data protection practices of insurers, insurance agents, and other licensed entities registered under state insurance laws. As we expand our insurance operations, we expect to be impacted by this legislation and be required to file compliance certifications pertaining to this legislation. We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary data and information by electronic means and are subject to numerous data privacy laws and regulations enacted in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including recent laws in California whose impact on our business are difficult to predict. While we have implemented cybersecurity policies and procedures, there is no guarantee our policies and procedures will protect our systems against all attacks or comply with all provisions of these evolving regulations. Changes in tax laws as a result of the enactment of tax legislation could impact our operations and profitability. Any future tax legislation or changes to tax laws such as changing the corporate or personal tax rate or changes to allowed tax deductions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability by causing us to incur additional tax expense or by having a financial impact on our policyholders. If states increase the assessments that we are required to pay, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. Certain jurisdictions in which PSIC is admitted to transact business require property and casualty insurers doing business within that jurisdiction to participate in insurance guaranty associations. These organizations pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. They levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state based on the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. States may also assess admitted companies to fund their respective department of insurance operations. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offset or in limited circumstances by surcharging policyholders. PSIC is licensed to conduct insurance operations on an admitted basis in 37 states. As PSIC grows, its share of any assessments in each state in which it underwrites business on an admitted basis may increase. PSIC paid assessments of 0.1 million in 2021 and 0.6 million in 2022. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments, because they depend on factors outside our control, such as insolvencies of other insurance companies as well as the occurrence of significant catastrophes. Assessments are generally covered by our catastrophe XOL treaties and, to the extent we have experienced a net loss from an event in excess of our net retention, assessments would be recovered from our reinsurers with no additional expense to us. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the ceding insurer) of our primary liability to our

 policyholders. Significant assessments could result in higher operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, while some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offset or, in limited circumstances, by surcharging policyholders, there is no certainty that offsets or surcharges will be permitted in connection with any future assessments. Because we are a holding company and substantially all our operations are conducted by our insurance subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends depends on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other permitted payments from our insurance subsidiaries. The continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial capital. We do not intend to declare and pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Because we are a holding company with no business operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders largely depends on dividends and other distributions from our insurance subsidiaries, PSIC, PESIC and PSRE. State insurance laws, including the laws of Oregon, California, Arizona, and the laws of Bermuda restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. The maximum dividend distribution absent the approval or non-disapproval of the insurance regulatory authority in Oregon, California and Arizona is limited by Oregon law at ORS 732.576, California law at Cal. Ins. Code 1215.5(g) and Arizona Revised Statute 20-481. Under Oregon statute, dividend payments from PSIC are further limited to that part of available policyholder surplus that is derived from net profits on our business. State insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends up to the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Moreover, state insurance regulators that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by PSIC and PESIC may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect. PSRE is highly regulated and is required to comply with various conditions before it is able to pay dividends or make distributions to us. Bermuda law, including the Insurance Act 1978, as amended Insurance Act and the Companies Act 1981, as amended Companies Act impose restrictions on PSRE s ability to pay dividends to us based on solvency margins and surplus and capital requirements. These restrictions, and any other future restrictions adopted by the BMA, could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by PSRE without affirmative approval of the BMA. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking immediate cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. The effects of litigation on our business are uncertain and could have an adverse effect on our business. As is typical in our industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types, including disputes relating to insurance claims under our policies as well as other general commercial and corporate litigation. Although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including insurance and claim settlement practices. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business. We rely on the use of credit scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies and any legal or regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to access credit score information could decrease the accuracy of our pricing and underwriting process and thus decrease our ability to be profitable. We use credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law. Consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 people and are calling for laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. Laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring, if enacted in states in which we operate, could impact the integrity of our pricing and underwriting processes, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and make it harder for us to be profitable over time. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology platform and brand, or we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our intellectual property, which includes our rights in our proprietary technology platform and our brand. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, service providers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Additionally, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability and scope of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business. Our success also depends in part on us not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. In the future, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Changes in accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially affect our reported financial results. Developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The impact of changes in GAAP cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, stockholders equity, and other relevant financial statement line items. In addition to compliance with GAAP on a consolidated basis, PSIC, PESIC, and PSRE are required to comply with statutory accounting principles SAP ). SAP and various components of SAP are subject to constant review by the NAIC and its task forces and committees, as well as state insurance departments to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial reporting. Various proposals are pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC, some of which, if enacted, could have negative effects on insurance industry participants. The NAIC continuously examines existing laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether or in what form such reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect us. We incur significant costs as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations. As a public company, we incur certain legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and therefore we need to have the ability to prepare financial statements that comply with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which 
 43 

Table of Contents 
 impose significant compliance obligations upon us. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We must maintain accounting and financial staff and consultants with appropriate public company reporting, technical accounting, and internal control knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404 and provide internal audit services. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, have increased regulation of, and imposed enhanced disclosure and corporate governance requirements on, public companies. Our efforts to comply with these evolving laws, regulations and standards increases our operating costs and divert management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities. These requirements also place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We must retain accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. As a public company, we are required, among other things, to: prepare and file periodic reports and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and requirements of Nasdaq; define and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors and its committees; institute comprehensive compliance and investor relations functions; and evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We may not be successful in complying with these requirements, and compliance with them could materially adversely affect our business. These requirements increase our costs and may cause us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees or as executive officers. In addition, if we fail to implement and maintain the required controls with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our results of operations on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. If we do not implement the required controls in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of our investors and customers and could negatively affect our business and cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline. We are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. As a public company with SEC reporting obligations, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual assessments by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must implement and maintain substantial internal control systems and procedures to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. During our assessments, we may identify deficiencies that we are unable to remediate in a timely manner. Testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting may also divert management s attention from other 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 matters that are important to the operation of our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the cost and scope of remediation actions and their effect on our operations may be significant. Moreover, any material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may impede our ability to file timely and accurate reports with the SEC. Any of the above could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or our common stock listing on Nasdaq to be suspended or terminated, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control. Under applicable Oregon, California and Arizona insurance laws and regulations, no person may acquire control of a domestic insurer until written approval is obtained from the state insurance commissioner following a public hearing on the proposed acquisition. Such approval would be contingent upon the state insurance commissioner s consideration of a number of factors including, among others, the financial strength of the proposed acquiror, the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Oregon, California and Arizona insurance laws and regulations pertaining to changes of control apply to both the direct and indirect acquisition of ten percent or more of the voting stock of an insurer domiciled in that state. Accordingly, the acquisition of ten percent or more of our common stock would be considered an indirect change of control of Palomar Holdings, Inc. and would trigger the applicable change of control filing requirements under Oregon, California and Arizona insurance laws and regulations, absent a disclaimer of control filing and its acceptance by the Oregon, California and Arizona Insurance Departments. These requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Palomar Holdings, Inc., including through transactions that some or all of the stockholders of Palomar Holdings, Inc. might consider to be desirable. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Future transactions where we raise capital may negatively affect our stock price. We are currently a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer and may file automatic shelf registration statements at any time with the SEC. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities under our current or future shelf registration statements could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities. Our operating results and stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose all or part of their investment. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the short- and long-term, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the factors described in this Risk Factors section and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are: market conditions in the broader stock market; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors; 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations; results of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors; short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock; guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance; strategic actions by us or our competitors; announcement by us, our competitors or our acquisition targets; sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock, including by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders; additions or departures in our Board or Directors, senior management or other key personnel; regulatory, legal or political developments; public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; litigation and governmental investigations; changing economic conditions; changes in accounting principles; any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; default under agreements governing our indebtedness; exposure to capital and credit market risks that adversely affect our investment portfolio or our capital resources; changes in our credit ratings; changes in corporate tax rates; exchange rate fluctuations; and other events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, pandemics, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks or responses to these events. The securities markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general market, economic and political conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence or interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets, including Nasdaq, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend, divert management s attention and resources or harm our business.

 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay a change in management and limit our share price. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if such a change in control would increase the value of our common stock and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current Board of Directors or management. Our charter documents contain anti-takeover provisions that will hinder takeover attempts and could reduce the market value of our common stock or prevent sale at a premium. Our anti-takeover provisions: permit the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; provide, through 2027, that our Board of Directors are classified into three classes with staggered, three year terms and that directors may only be removed for cause; require super-majority voting to amend provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; include blank-check preferred stock, the preference, rights and other terms of which may be set by the Board of Directors and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairman of our Board of Directors, or our chief executive officer; prohibit stockholder action by other than unanimous written consent; provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a period of time. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following civil actions: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

 However, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, this provision applies to Securities Act claims and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business and our industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may , will , should , expects , plans , anticipates , could , intends , target , projects , contemplates , believes , estimates , predicts , would , potential or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.

 Item 2. Properties Our primary executive offices and insurance operations are located in La Jolla, California, which occupy approximately 14,700 square feet of office space for annual rent and rent-related operating payments of approximately 0.7 million. The lease for this space expires in 2024. We also have an office in Edina, Minnesota, which occupies 7,457 square feet of office space for annual rent and rent-related operating payments of approximately 0.2 million. The lease for this space expires in 2027. We do not own any real property. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to routine legal proceedings in the normal course of operating our insurance business. We are not involved in any legal proceedings which reasonably could be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market information for Common Stock Our common shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol PLMR on April 17, 2019. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common shares. As of February 22, 2023, there were approximately 9 holders of record of our common stock. Because most of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of our stockholders, this number is not representative our total stockholders. Payment of Dividends The continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial capital. We do not intend to declare and pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Because we are a holding company with no business operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders largely depends on dividends and other distributions from our U.S. subsidiaries, PESIC and PSIC, and our Bermuda subsidiary, PSRE. State insurance laws, including the laws of Arizona, Oregon and California, and the laws of Bermuda restrict the ability these subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus and restrict dividend payments. Dividend payments are further limited to that part of available policyholder surplus that is derived from net profits on our business. State insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends up to the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Moreover, state insurance regulators may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect. Our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is highly regulated and is required to comply with various conditions before it is able to pay dividends or make distributions to us. Bermuda law, including the Insurance Act 1978, as amended Insurance Act and the Companies Act 1981, as amended Companies Act impose restrictions on our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us based on solvency margins and surplus and capital requirements. These restrictions, and any other future restrictions adopted by the BMA, could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary without affirmative approval of the BMA.

 Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking immediate cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a 40 million share repurchase program and the Company repurchased 15.9 million of shares under this program in 2021.

 We provide admitted insurance products through our Oregon domiciled insurance company, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company PSIC ), and E S insurance products through our Arizona domiciled surplus lines insurance company, Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company PESIC ). Each of our insurance company subsidiaries as carries an A- rating from A.M. Best Company A.M. Best ), a leading rating agency for the insurance industry. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including retail agents, program administrators, wholesale brokers, and partnerships with other insurance companies. Our business strategy is supported by a comprehensive risk transfer program with reinsurance coverage that we believe reduces earnings volatility and provides appropriate levels of protection from catastrophic events. Our management team combines decades of insurance industry experience across specialty underwriting, reinsurance, program administration, distribution, and analytics. Founded in 2014, we have significantly grown our business and have generated attractive returns. We have organically increased gross written premiums from 16.6 million in our first year of operations to 881.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of approximately 64 . We have also been profitable since 2016 and our net income growth since 2016 reflects a compound annual growth rate of 41 . We seek to continuously grow our income by developing product offerings for lines of business that harness our core competencies and where we believe we can generate attractive risk adjusted returns. Since 2021, we have introduced several new products including General Casualty, Fronting, Excess Liability, and Excess Property to diversify our book of business and broaden our product portfolio. We believe that our market opportunity, distinctive products, and differentiated business model position us to grow our business profitably. Components of Our Results of Operations Gross Written Premiums Gross written premiums are the amounts received or to be received for insurance policies written or assumed by us during a specific period of time without reduction for policy acquisition costs, reinsurance costs or other deductions. The volume of our gross written premiums in any given period is generally influenced by: Volume of new business submissions in existing products or partnerships; Binding of new business submissions in existing products or partnerships into policies; Entrance into new partnerships or the offering of new types of insurance products; Exits from existing partnerships or reducing or ceasing to offer existing insurance products; Renewal rates of existing policies; and Average size and premium rate of bound policies. 
 Our gross written premiums are also impacted when we assume unearned in-force premiums due to new partnerships or other business reasons. In periods where we assume a large volume of unearned premiums, our gross written premiums may increase significantly compared to prior periods and the increase may not be indicative of future trends. Ceded Written Premiums Ceded written premiums are the amount of gross written premiums ceded to reinsurers. We enter into reinsurance contracts to limit our exposure to potential losses and to provide additional capacity for growth. We cede premiums through excess of loss XOL agreements, quota share agreements, and fronting agreements. Ceded written premiums are earned pro-rata over the period of risk covered. The volume of our ceded written premiums is impacted by the amount of our gross written premiums and our decisions to increase or decrease limits or retention levels in our XOL agreements and co-participation levels in our quota share agreements. The volume of ceded written premiums is also impacted by the amount of premium we write under fronting agreements. 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 Our ceded written premiums can be impacted significantly in certain periods due to changes in quota share agreements. In periods where we modify a quota share agreement, ceded written premiums may increase or decrease significantly compared to prior periods and these fluctuations may not be indicative of future trends. Our XOL costs as a percentage of gross earned premiums also may vary each period due to changes of premium in-force during the XOL contract period or due to acceleration of XOL charges or the need to purchase additional reinsurance due to losses. In addition, the volume of premiums ceded in fronting agreements each period may vary due to the timing of entering new fronting partnerships and terminations of fronting partnerships. Net Earned Premiums Net earned premiums represent the earned portion of our gross written premiums, less the earned portion that is ceded to third-party reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements. The majority of our insurance policies have a term of one year and premiums are earned pro rata over the terms of the policies. Commission and Other Income Commission and other income consist of commissions earned on policies written on behalf of third-party insurance companies where we have no exposure to the insured risk and certain fees earned in conjunction with underwriting policies. Commission and other income are earned on the effective date of the underlying policy. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the costs incurred for losses, net of any losses ceded to reinsurers. These expenses are a function of the size and term of the insurance policies we write and the loss experience associated with the underlying coverage. Certain policies we write subject us to attritional losses such as building fires. In addition, many of the policies we write subject us to catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses are certain losses resulting from events involving multiple claims and policyholders, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, convective storms, terrorist acts or other aggregating events. Our losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally affected by: The occurrence, frequency and severity of catastrophe events in the areas where we underwrite policies relating to these perils; The occurrence, frequency and severity of non-catastrophe attritional losses; The mix of business written by us; The reinsurance agreements we have in place at the time of a loss; The geographic location and characteristics of the policies we underwrite; Changes in the legal or regulatory environment related to the business we write; Trends in legal defense costs; Inflation in housing and construction costs; and Increases in amounts awarded by courts and juries. 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Losses and loss adjustment expenses may be paid out over multiple years. Acquisition Expenses Acquisition expenses are principally comprised of the commissions we pay retail agents, program administrators and wholesale brokers, net of ceding commissions and fronting fees we receive on business ceded under quota share and fronting reinsurance agreements. In addition, acquisition expenses include premium-related taxes and 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 other fees. Acquisition expenses related to each policy we write are deferred and expensed pro rata over the term of the policy. We earn fronting fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premiums on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. Other Underwriting Expenses Other underwriting expenses represent the general and administrative expenses of our insurance operations including employee salaries and benefits, software and technology costs, office rent, stock-based compensation, licenses and fees, and professional services fees such as legal, accounting, and actuarial services. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of the unused line fee and amortization of the commitment fee on our credit agreement with U.S. Bank National Association and interest incurred on borrowings from our FHLB line of credit. Net Investment Income We earn investment income on our portfolio of invested assets. We invest primarily in investment grade fixed maturity securities, including U.S. government issues, state government issues, mortgage and asset-backed obligations, and corporate bonds with a small portion of our portfolio in equity securities and cash and cash equivalents. The principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio, the yield on that portfolio, and investment management expenses. As measured by amortized cost, which excludes fair value fluctuations from changes in interest rates or other factors, the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of our invested capital along with premiums we receive from our insureds, less payments on policyholder claims and other operating expenses. Our balance of invested capital may be impacted in the future by repurchases of shares of our common stock or borrowings under our credit agreements. Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments are a function of the difference between the amount received by us on the sale of a security and the security s cost-basis, mark-to-market adjustments, credit losses recognized in earnings, and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and do not impact our net income. Income Tax Expense Currently our income tax expense consists mainly of federal income taxes imposed on our operations. Our effective tax rates are dependent upon the components of pretax earnings and the related tax effects.

 Key Financial and Operating Metrics We discuss certain key financial and operating metrics, described below, which provide useful information about our business and the operational factors underlying our financial performance. Underwriting revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue, excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP to underwriting revenue. Underwriting income is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as income before income taxes excluding net investment income, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and interest expense. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of income before income taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP to underwriting income. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook, net of tax impact. We calculate the tax impact only on adjustments which would be included in calculating our income tax expense using the estimated tax rate at which the company received a deduction for these adjustments. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of net income calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income. Annualized return on equity is net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders equity during the period. Annualized adjusted return on equity is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders equity during the period. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of return on equity calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to adjusted return on equity. Loss ratio , expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses, to net earned premiums. Expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of acquisition and other underwriting expenses, net of commission and other income to net earned premiums. Combined ratio is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100 generally indicates an underwriting loss. Adjusted combined ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio calculated excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of combined ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to adjusted combined ratio. Diluted adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period, reflecting the dilution which could occur if equity-based awards are converted into common share equivalents as calculated using the treasury stock method. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to diluted adjusted earnings per share. Catastrophe loss ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as the ratio of catastrophe losses to net earned premiums. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of loss ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to catastrophe loss ratio.

 (2) Beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are including the impact of net realized and unrealized losses and gains on investments as an adjustment to our net income. As this balance is primarily driven by equity market fluctuations rather than our underlying business performance, we believe adding this adjustment provides a more meaningful comparison of our performance. We have also changed the prior year adjusted net income to conform to this presentation. 
 Gross Written Premiums Gross written premiums were 881.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 535.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 346.7 million, or 64.8 . Premium growth was primarily due to an increased volume of policies written across our lines of business which was driven by new business generated with existing partners, strong premium retention rates for existing business, expansion of our distribution footprint, and new partnerships. For commercial products, substantial rate increases also contributed to premium growth. The following table summarizes our gross written premiums by line of business and shows each line s percentage of total gross written premiums for each period:

In a fronting agreement, we write the premium and then cede the majority of the premium and risk in exchange for a fronting fee, which is our primary source of profit in the arrangement. We expect to continue to write fronting premiums for the foreseeable future. The volume of fronting premiums written each period may vary due to the timing of entering new fronting partnerships and terminations of fronting partnerships. During the second quarter of 2022, we ceased writing Specialty Homeowners business outside of Texas and converted our Texas Specialty Homeowners business to a fronting arrangement beginning June 1, 2022. These underwriting changes caused the decline in Specialty Homeowners premiums shown above.

The increase was primarily due to increased premiums ceded under quota share and fronting agreements due to growth in the volume of written premiums subject to quota share or fronting agreements. In addition, we incurred increased excess of loss XOL reinsurance expense due to growth in exposure. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our XOL reinsurance expense was impacted by Hurricane Ian. Catastrophe losses from Ian caused us to utilize certain layers of our XOL program and incur approximately 2.0 million of expense associated with the acceleration of XOL expense and the reinstatement of our reinsurance program. We also will incur an additional 1.9 million of XOL expense in 2023 related to the reinstatement of our reinsurance program due to Ian related Catastrophe losses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our XOL reinsurance expense was significantly impacted by Winter Storm Uri Uri ). Catastrophe losses from Uri caused us to utilize certain layers of our XOL program and incur approximately 7.9 million of expense associated with the reinstatement of our reinsurance program. Ceded written premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums increased to 59.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 41.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to increased quota share and fronting cessions as previously described. Net Written Premiums Net written premiums increased 45.6 million, or 14.6 , to 357.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 311.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gross written premiums, partially offset by increased ceded written premiums. Net Earned Premiums Net earned premiums increased 82.6 million, or 35.3 , to 316.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 233.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to the earning of increased gross written premiums offset by the earning of ceded written premiums under reinsurance agreements. The table below shows the amount of premiums we earned on a gross and net basis for each period presented:

This was due to an increase in policy related fees associated with an increased volume of premiums written. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased 37.2 million, or 89.8 , to 78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses consisted of the following elements during the respective periods: 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change in thousands) Catastrophe losses 15,394 5,015 10,379 207.0 Non-catastrophe losses 63,278 36,442 26,836 73.6 Total losses and loss adjustment expenses 78,672 41,457 37,215 89.8 Catastrophe loss ratio 4.9 2.1 Non-catastrophe loss ratio 20.0 15.6 Catastrophe losses during the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to losses from Hurricane Ian which primarily impacted our Commercial All Risk line of business. Catastrophe losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included losses from Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas, Winter Storm Uri, and a single loss from an excess liability indemnity policy covered by PESIC. Non-catastrophe losses and loss ratio increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 due mainly to growth on lines of business subject to attritional losses such as Inland Marine, Commercial All Risk, and Casualty. Acquisition Expenses Acquisition expenses increased 15.3 million, or 16.1 , to 110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher earned premiums which resulted in higher commissions and premium-related taxes. The higher commissions and premium-related taxes were partially offset by higher earned ceding commissions and fronting fees due to an increase in premiums subject to a quota share or fronting agreement. Acquisition expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 15.9 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 22.0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Acquisition expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums decreased due to the recognition of higher ceding commission and fronting fee income as a percentage of gross earned premiums due to changes in mix of business produced and growth in fronting premiums.

 Other Underwriting Expenses Other underwriting expenses increased 15.5 million, or 28.8 , to 69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the Company incurring higher payroll, technology, and stock-based compensation expenses associated with growth of the Company. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 10.0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 12.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of expenses relating to transactions, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and catastrophe bonds, other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 7.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 10.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This percentage decreased due to an increase in earned premiums without a corresponding increase in operating expenses. Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net investment income increased 4.8 million, or 52.8 , to 13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a higher average balance of investments during the year ended December 31, 2022 and higher yields on invested assets. The Company incurred 7.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses on investments for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a 1.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher realized losses on fixed maturity securities and unrealized losses on our equity securities held during the period ended December 31, 2022. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and do not impact our net income. The following table summarizes the components of our investment income for each period presented:

For the year ended December 31, 2022 our effective tax rate was 22.8 and the difference between our tax effective tax rate and the statutory rate of 21 relates primarily to non-deductible executive compensation expense and state taxes, offset by the permanent component of employee stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective tax rate was 19.8 and the difference between our tax rate and the statutory rate of 21 relates primarily to a benefit from the permanent component of employee stock option exercises and charges related to state tax accruals, offset by the non-deductible executive compensation expense.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Underwriting Revenue We define underwriting revenue as total revenue excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. Underwriting revenue represents revenue generated by our underwriting operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting revenue should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting revenue differently.

Underwriting income represents the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for pre-tax income calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting income differently. We define adjusted underwriting income as underwriting income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Adjusted underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for pre-tax income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define adjusted underwriting income differently.

We calculate the tax impact only on adjustments which would be included in calculating our income tax expense using the estimated tax rate at which the company received a deduction for these adjustments. We use adjusted net income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and financial statement users useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.

Our definition of tangible stockholders equity may not be comparable to that of other companies, and it should not be viewed as a substitute for stockholders equity calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use tangible stockholders equity internally to evaluate the strength of our balance sheet and to compare returns relative to this measure. Stockholders equity calculated in accordance with GAAP reconciles to tangible stockholders equity as follows:

Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and pay taxes and administrative expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates, whose ability to pay us is highly regulated. The Company s U.S. insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC and PESIC are restricted by the statutes as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without prior approval by state insurance commissioners. Under California and Oregon statute which govern PSIC, dividends paid in a consecutive twelve month period cannot exceed the greater of (i) 10 of an insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) 100 of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Any dividends or distributions in excess of these amounts would require regulatory approval. In addition, under Oregon statute PSIC may only declare a dividend from earned surplus, which does not include contributed capital. Surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets is not considered part of earned surplus. Based on the above restrictions, PSIC may

Table of Contents 
 pay a dividend or distribution of no greater than 78.2 million in 2023 without approval by the California and Oregon Insurance Commissioners. Under Arizona statute which governs PESIC, dividends paid in a consecutive twelve month period cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 10 of an insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) 100 of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Based on the above restrictions, PESIC may not pay a dividend or distribution in 2023 without approval of the Arizona Insurance Commissioner due to incurring a statutory net loss in 2022. In addition to the above limitations, any dividend or distribution declared is also subject to state regulatory approval prior to payment. In the future, state insurance regulatory authorities may adopt statutory provisions and dividend limitations more restrictive than those currently in effect. Insurance companies in the United States are also required by state law to maintain a minimum level of policyholder s surplus. State insurance regulators have a risk-based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of the insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the total adjusted capital of PSIC and PESIC were in excess of their respective prescribed risk-based capital requirements. Under the Insurance Act and related regulations, our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, PSRE, is required to maintain certain solvency and liquidity levels, which it maintained as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. PSRE maintains a Class 3A license and thus must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio in which the value of its relevant assets is not less than 75 of the amount of its relevant liabilities for general business. Relevant assets include cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities, accrued interest income, premiums receivable, losses recoverable from reinsurers, and funds withheld. The relevant liabilities include total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities, less sundry liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we met the minimum liquidity ratio requirement. Bermuda regulations limit the amount of dividends and return of capital paid by a regulated entity. A Class 3A insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin, its enhanced capital requirement, or its minimum liquidity ratio, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. If a Class 3A insurer has failed to meet its minimum solvency margin on the last day of any financial year, it will also be prohibited, without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority BMA ), from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. Furthermore, the Insurance Act limits the ability of PSRE to pay dividends or make capital distributions by stipulating certain margin and solvency requirements and by requiring approval from the BMA prior to a reduction of 15 or more of a Class 3A insurer s total statutory capital as reported on its prior year statutory balance sheet. Moreover, an insurer must submit an affidavit to the BMA, sworn by at least two directors and the principal representative in Bermuda of the Class 3A insurer, at least seven days prior to payment of any dividend which would exceed 25 of that insurer s total statutory capital and surplus as reported on its prior year statutory balance sheet. The affidavit must state that in the opinion of those swearing the declaration of such dividend has not caused the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins. Further, under the Companies Act, PSRE may only declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that: (1) it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or (2) the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities. Pursuant to Bermuda regulations, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available to be paid by a reinsurer is determined pursuant to a formula. Under this formula, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available from PSRE during 2023 is calculated to be approximately 3.9 million. However, this dividend amount is subject to annual enhanced solvency requirement calculations. During the year ended December 31 2021, PSRE paid dividends of 15.0 million and 10.0 million to the Company. These dividend payments were approved by the BMA. There were no dividends declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 One of our insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Membership allows PSIC access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets. Cash Flows Our primary sources of cash flow are written premiums, investment income, reinsurance recoveries, sales and redemptions of investments, and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities. We use our cash flows primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, operating expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and income taxes. Our cash flows from operations may differ substantially from our net income due to non-cash charges or due to changes in balance sheet accounts. The timing of our cash flows from operating activities can also vary among periods due to the timing by which payments are made or received. Some of our payments and receipts, including loss settlements and subsequent reinsurance receipts, can be significant. Therefore, their timing can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period. The potential for a large claim under an insurance or reinsurance contract means that our insurance subsidiaries may need to make substantial payments within relatively short periods of time, which would have a negative impact on our operating cash flows. We generated positive cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management believes that cash receipts from premium, proceeds from investment sales and redemptions, and investment income and reinsurance recoveries, if necessary, are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 in thousands) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 169,584 87,814 Investing activities (156,808) (58,188) Financing activities 5,017 (13,041) Change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 17,793 16,585 Our cash flow from operating activities has been positive in each of the last two years. Variations in operating cash flow between periods are primarily driven by variations in our gross and ceded written premiums and the volume and timing of premium receipts, claim payments, reinsurance payments, and reinsurance recoveries on paid losses. In addition, fluctuations in losses and loss adjustment expenses and other insurance operating expenses impact operating cash flow. Cash used in investing activities for each of the last two years related primarily to purchases of fixed income and equity securities in excess of sales and maturities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to 36.4 million in proceeds from our FHLB line of credit and 3.0 million in proceeds from common stock issued via stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan, offset by the repurchase of 34.4 million of our common stock. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the repurchase of 15.9 million of our common stock offset by 2.8 million in proceeds from common stock issued via stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan.

 We do not have any current plans for material capital expenditures other than current operating requirements. We believe that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond. The key factor that will affect our future operating cash flows is the frequency and severity of catastrophic loss events. To the extent our future operating cash flows are insufficient to cover our net losses from catastrophic events, we had 621.8 million in cash and investment securities available at December 31, 2022. We also have the ability to access additional capital through pursuing third-party borrowings including our credit agreement, sales of our equity or debt securities or entrance into a reinsurance arrangement. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table illustrates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments by due date as of December 31, 2022: 

One Year Three Years Less Than to Less Than to Less Than More Than Total One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years (in thousands) Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 231,415 177,877 29,513 23,742 283 Operating lease obligations 2,187 966 808 413 Total 233,602 178,843 30,321 24,155 283 The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent management s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling losses. As more fully discussed in Critical Accounting Policies Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses below, the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on various complex and subjective judgments. Actual losses paid may differ, perhaps significantly, from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the timing of payment of our estimated losses is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity. The assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns, but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments, there is a risk that the amounts paid can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed above. The amounts in the above table represent our gross estimates of known liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and do not include any allowance for claims for future events within the time period specified. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the total amounts of obligations paid by us in the time periods shown will be greater than those indicated in the table. Share repurchases During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a 40 million share repurchase program and we repurchased 15.9 million of shares under this program in 2021. On January 24, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, replacing the existing program and authorizing the repurchase by the Company of up to 100 million of our outstanding shares of common stock over the period ending on March 31, 2024 . We purchased 621,415 shares for 34.4 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 65.6 million remains available for future repurchases. The timing and amount of future share repurchases will depend on several factors, including our stock price performance, ongoing capital planning considerations, general market conditions, and applicable legal requirements. Credit Agreement In December 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank National Association which provides a revolving credit facility of up to 100 million through December 8, 2026. Interest on the credit facility accrues on each SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) rate loan at the applicable SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.75 and on each base rate loan at the applicable Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.75 . A loan may be either a SOFR rate loan or a base rate loan, at our discretion. Outstanding

 amounts under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in full or in part at any time with no prepayment premium and may be reduced in full or in part at any time upon prior notice. As of December 31, 2022 we do not have any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, but we may seek to borrow under the Credit Agreement in the future. Our PSIC subsidiary is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco FHLB ). Membership in the FHLB provides PSIC access to collateralized advances, which can be drawn for general corporate purposes and used to enhance liquidity management. All borrowings are fully secured by a pledge of specific investment securities of PSIC and the borrowing capacity is equal to 10 of PSIC s statutory admitted assets. All advances have predetermined term and the interest rate varies based on the term of the advance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 36.4 million of borrowings outstanding through the FHLB line of credit. Financial Condition Stockholders Equity At December 31, 2022 total stockholders equity was 384.8 million and tangible stockholders equity was 376.5 million, compared to total stockholders equity of 394.2 million and tangible stockholders equity of 384.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Stockholders equity decreased primarily due to unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities and repurchases of shares of our common stock and was partially offset by the net income we earned for the period and activity related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is treated as an additional paid-in-capital and increases stockholders equity. Tangible stockholders equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of stockholders equity in accordance with GAAP to tangible stockholders equity. Investment Portfolio Our primary investment objectives are to maintain liquidity, preserve capital and generate a stable level of investment income. We purchase securities that we believe are attractive on a relative value basis and seek to generate returns in excess of predetermined benchmarks. Our Board of Directors approves our investment guidelines in compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions on asset type, quality and concentration. Our current investment guidelines allow us to invest in taxable and tax-exempt fixed maturities, as well as publicly traded mutual funds and common stock of individual companies. Our cash and invested assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities, and equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our investment portfolio, or 515.1 million, was comprised of fixed maturity securities that are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of applicable taxes, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Also included in our investment portfolio were 38.6 million of equity securities. In addition, we maintained a non-restricted cash and cash equivalent balance of 68.1 million at December 31, 2022. Our fixed maturity securities, including cash equivalents, had a weighted average effective duration of 3.81 and 3.99 years and an average rating of A1/A+ and A2/A at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Our fixed income investment portfolio had a book yield of 3.30 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 2.23 as of December 31, 2021.

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates- Investment Valuation and Fair Value for discussion of investment valuation considerations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. For a detailed discussion of our accounting policies, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date. We do not discount this reserve. We seek to establish reserves that will ultimately prove to be adequate. We categorize our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses into two types: case reserves and reserves for incurred but not yet reported losses IBNR ). Through our third-party administrators TPAs ), we generally are notified of losses by our insureds or their agents or brokers. Based on the information provided by the TPAs, we establish initial case reserves by estimating the ultimate losses from the claim, including administrative costs associated with the ultimate settlement of the claim. Our personnel use their knowledge of the specific claim along with internal and external experts, including underwriters and legal counsel, to estimate the expected ultimate losses. 
 74 

Table of Contents 
 We establish IBNR reserves to provide for (i) the estimated amount of future loss payments on incurred claims not yet reported, and (ii) potential development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are estimated based on generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques that consider quantitative loss experience data and, where appropriate, qualitative factors. With the assistance of an independent actuarial firm, we use statistical analysis to estimate the cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to IBNR. Those estimates are based on our historical information, industry information and practices, and estimates of trends that may affect the ultimate frequency of incurred but not reported claims and changes in ultimate claims severity. We regularly review our reserve estimates and adjust them as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations. During the loss settlement period, if we have indications that claims frequency or severity exceeds our initial expectations, we generally increase our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Conversely, when claims frequency and severity trends are more favorable than initially anticipated, we generally reduce our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses once we have sufficient data to confirm the validity of the favorable trends. Even after such adjustments, the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimate included in our consolidated financial statements. The following tables summarize our gross and net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

On a quarterly basis, we perform an analysis of our loss development and select the expected ultimate loss ratio for each of our product lines by accident year. In our actuarial analysis, we use input from our TPAs and our underwriting departments, including premium pricing assumptions and historical experience. Multiple actuarial methods are used to estimate the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. These methods utilize, to varying degrees, the initial expected loss ratio, detailed statistical analysis of past claims reporting and payment patterns, claims frequency and severity, paid loss experience, industry loss experience, and changes in market conditions, policy forms, exclusions, and exposures. The actuarial methods used to estimate loss reserves are: Reported and/or Paid Loss Development Methods Ultimate losses are estimated based on historical reported and/or paid loss patterns. Reported losses are the sum of paid and case losses. Industry development patterns are substituted for historical development patterns when sufficient historical data is not available. IBNR-to-Case Reserve Ratio Method This method calculates ratios of IBNR to case reserves based on incurred and paid development factors from the development methods. Estimated IBNR equals the product of case reserves and the IBNR-to-case reserve ratio. These IBNR amounts are added to the reported-to-date amount to derive ultimate losses.

 Reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson Severity Method Under this method, ultimate losses are estimated as the sum of cumulative reported losses and estimated IBNR losses. IBNR losses are estimated based on expected average severity, estimated ultimate claim counts and the historical development patterns of reported losses. Reported Bornhuetter Ferguson Pure Premium Method Under this method, ultimate losses are estimated as the sum of cumulative reported losses and estimated IBNR losses. IBNR losses are estimated based on expected pure premium and on the historical development patterns of reported losses. 
 The method(s) used vary based on the line of business and the nature of the loss event. Development patterns for catastrophic events are based on the time since event versus an accident quarter and year pattern used for non-catastrophic events. Considering each of the alternative ultimate estimates, we select an estimate of ultimate loss for each line of business. For Earthquake and Difference in Conditions policies, more emphasis is placed on reported methods. For the remainder, a weighted average is selected. Loss Adjustment Expense reserves are estimated based on the ratio of paid loss adjustment expense to paid loss, which is estimated separately by line of business as well as split by hurricane and excluding hurricane. We then apply this ratio to our estimated unpaid loss, by multiplying the ratio times 50 of loss case reserves and 100 of loss IBNR reserves. This is applied by line of business and accident year to arrive at estimated unpaid loss adjustment expense on a gross basis. We then add the estimated unpaid loss adjustment expense on a gross basis to the paid loss adjustment expense to calculate estimated ultimate loss adjustment expense. On a quarterly basis, the leaders of our executive management, accounting, actuarial, and claims teams meet to review the recommendations made by our actuarial team and use their best judgment to determine the best estimate to be recorded for the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses on our balance sheet. Our reserves are driven by several important factors, including litigation and regulatory trends, legislative activity, climate change, social and economic patterns and claims inflation assumptions. Our reserve estimates reflect current inflation in legal claims settlements and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. The impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific, significant new regulation or legislation. In the event of significant new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business, but no assurance can be given that our attempt to quantify such inputs will be accurate or successful. The table below quantifies the impact of potential reserve deviations from our carried reserve at December 31, 2022. We applied sensitivity factors to incurred losses for the three most recent accident years and to the carried reserve for all prior accident years combined. We believe that potential changes such as these would not have a material impact on our liquidity.

 The amount by which estimated losses differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development. Development is unfavorable when the losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on unresolved claims. Development is favorable when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved, or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on unresolved claims. We reflect favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. The following tables present the development of our loss reserves by accident year on a gross basis and net of reinsurance recoveries during each of the below calendar years: Gross Ultimate Loss and LAE Development- (Favorable) Unfavorable Calendar Year 2019 to 2020 to 2021 to Accident Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 (in thousands) Prior 81,778 78,503 83,896 87,938 (3,275) 5,393 4,042 2020 171,470 194,752 206,532 23,282 11,780 2021 171,922 156,434 (15,488) 2022 200,765 (3,275) 28,675 334 Net Ultimate Loss and LAE Development- (Favorable) Unfavorable Calendar Year 2019 to 2020 to 2021 to Accident Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 (in thousands) Prior 33,958 33,894 33,487 33,870 (64) (407) 383 2020 64,179 61,001 64,171 (3,178) 3,170 2021 45,042 43,872 (1,170) 2022 76,289 (64) (3,585) 2,383 During the year ended December 31, 2022, our total gross incurred losses for accident years 2021 and prior developed unfavorably by 0.3 million. The gross unfavorable development was due primarily to losses on certain 2020 Hurricanes emerging at a higher severity than expected, primarily in our special property lines of business. This was offset by favorable development on 2021 attritional and catastrophe losses. On a net basis, the development was unfavorable by 2.4 million due to the effect of ceding under our reinsurance program. The favorable 2021 development was subject to a higher amount of ceding versus the unfavorable 2020 development resulting in the net unfavorable development being higher than the gross amount. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our gross incurred losses for accident years 2020 and prior developed unfavorably by 28.7 million. The gross unfavorable development was due primarily to losses on certain 2020 Hurricanes emerging at a higher severity than expected, primarily in our special property lines of business. On a net basis, the development was favorable by 3.6 million due to the effect of ceding gross unfavorable development under our reinsurance program. The catastrophe events which experienced unfavorable development were primarily subject to ceding under our XOL treaties while the catastrophe events which experienced favorable development were subject to a lower amount of ceding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our gross incurred losses for accident years 2018 and prior developed favorably by 3.3 million. The gross favorable development was due to reported losses emerging at a lower level than expected, primarily in our homeowners and special property lines of business, offset by higher frequency and severity of losses emerging in our assumed reinsurance line. The net favorable development of 0.1 million reflects the effect of ceding the gross favorability under our reinsurance program.

 Although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions. Specifically, our actual ultimate loss ratio could differ from our initial expected loss ratio or our actual reporting and payment patterns could differ from our expected reporting and payment patterns, which are based on our own data and industry data. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We regularly review our estimates and adjust them as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in the results of current operations. Investment Valuation and Fair Value We invest in a variety of investment grade fixed maturity securities, including U.S. government issues, state government issues, mortgage and asset-backed obligations, and corporate bonds. All of our investments in fixed maturity securities and equity securities are carried at fair value, defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. In our disclosure of the fair value of our investments, we utilize a hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar investments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar investments in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Pricing inputs into models are unobservable for the investment. The unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. We use independent pricing sources to obtain the estimated fair values of investments. The fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the type of investment. The fair values obtained from independent pricing sources are reviewed for reasonableness and any discrepancies are investigated for final valuation. The fair value of our investments in fixed maturity securities is estimated using relevant inputs, including available market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. An Option Adjusted Spread model is also used to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. These fair value measurements are estimated based on observable, objectively verifiable market information rather than market quotes; therefore, these investments are classified and disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The fair value of our investments in equity securities is based on quoted prices available in active markets and classified and disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. Investment securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in issuer-specific circumstances, such as credit rating, and changes in industry-specific circumstances, such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks. In addition, fixed maturities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates. As a result of these potential fluctuations, it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security. Unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of total stockholders equity. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of net income on the Company s consolidated statement of income.

Table of Contents 
 All financial assets measured at amortized cost, including available-for-sale securities are required to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by means of an allowance for credit losses that is included in net income. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are also required to be recorded through a reversible allowance for credit losses, but the allowance is limited to the amount by which fair value is less than amortized cost. The Company reviews all securities with unrealized losses on a regular basis to assess whether the decline in the securities fair value necessitates the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. Factors considered in the review include the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, and current market interest rates and whether the unrealized loss is credit- driven or a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company also considers factors specific to the issuer including the general financial condition of the issuer, the issuers industry and future business prospects, any past failure of issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and the payment structure of the investment and the issuers ability to make contractual payments on the investment. The Company also considers whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. When assessing whether it intends to sell a fixed-maturity security or if it is likely to be required to sell a fixed-maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost, the Company evaluates facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition the investment portfolio, potential sales of investments to meet cash flow needs, and potential sales of investments to capitalize on favorable pricing. For fixed-maturity securities where a decline in fair value is below the amortized cost basis and the Company intends to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, a credit-loss charge is recognized in net income based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment. For fixed-maturity securities that the Company has the intent and ability to hold, the Company compares the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. The extent to which the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security represents the credit-related portion of the impairment, which is recognized in net income through an allowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company reports accrued interest receivable as a component of accrued investment income on its consolidated balance sheet which is presented separately from available-for-sale securities. The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable and instead would write off accrued interest receivable at the time an issuer defaults or is expected to default on payments. Deferred Income Taxes We account for taxes under the asset and liability method, under which we record deferred income taxes as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet to reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax assets result from temporary differences primarily attributable to unearned premiums, net operating losses NOLs and unrealized losses on investments. Our deferred tax liabilities result primarily from deferred acquisition costs, internally developed software, and unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We recognize deferred tax assets when we determine that such assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized in future periods. In making such a determination, we consider all available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, projected future tax rates, and results of recent operations. On a quarterly basis, we review our deferred tax assets and, if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we reduce our deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. The assessment requires significant judgement and review of all positive and negative

 evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some of portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, we are required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information regarding reversals of existing temporary differences, carryback capacity, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Recent events, including changes in market interest rates and significant financial market volatility have caused us to incur unrealized losses on investments which contributes to us having a net capital deferred tax asset in the amount of 11.0 million at December 31, 2022, as compared to a net capital deferred tax liability of 0.3 million at December 31, 2021. We are currently utilizing tax planning strategies in our assessment of the realizability of a portion of our net capital deferred tax asset at December 31, 2022. These tax planning strategies include the holding of fixed maturity and equity securities that are currently in a net unrealized loss position for tax purposes until recovery or maturity, if needed, to avoid future expiring capital loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of 3.0 million relating to our state net operating loss carryforwards and the remainder of our deferred tax assets did not require a valuation allowance. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted and their potential impact to our financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our consolidated balance sheets include assets and liabilities with estimated fair values that are subject to market risk. Our primary market risks have been equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities and interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We do not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity risk. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in an issuer s ability to repay its debt obligations. General concern exists about the number of municipalities experiencing financial difficulties in light of the adverse economic conditions experienced over the past several years. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our municipal bond portfolio by investing in high quality securities and by diversifying our holdings, which are typically either general obligation or revenue bonds related to essential products and services. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our corporate bond portfolio by investing in high quality securities and by diversifying our holdings. We monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that credit risk does not exceed prudent levels. The majority of our investment portfolio is invested in high credit quality, investment grade fixed maturity securities. We also invest in higher yielding fixed maturities and equity securities. Our fixed maturity portfolio has an average rating by at least one nationally recognized rating organization of AA , with approximately 79.5 rated A or better. At December 31, 2022, 2.0 of our fixed maturity portfolio was unrated or rated below investment grade. Our fixed maturity portfolio includes some securities issued with financial guaranty insurance. We purchase fixed maturities based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying assets without regard to insurance.

Table of Contents 
 Interest Rate Risk We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset/liability matching and capital management process. In the management of this risk, the characteristics of duration, credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements. We regularly assess these risks and balance them within the context of our liability and capital position. As of December 31, 2022 the estimated fair value of our fixed maturities was 515.1 million. We estimate that a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would cause a 3.7 decline in the estimated fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio, while a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a 3.9 increase in the estimated fair value of that portfolio. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio. Inflation We establish our insurance premiums prior to knowing the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts. We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in our pricing and our establishing of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause losses and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated. Inflation assumptions also impact our reinsurance costs and the amount of reinsurance we must purchase to meet certain thresholds and higher inflation assumptions cause our reinsurance costs to increase. Substantial future increases in inflation could also result in future increases in interest rates, which in turn are likely to result in a decline in the market value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized losses or reductions in total stockholders equity. Seasonality Our Commercial All Risk and Hawaii Hurricane businesses expose us to claims from seasonal weather events such as hurricanes and windstorms. The occurrence of such events typically increases between June and November of each year. As a result, we may experience increased losses in our Commercial All Risk and Hawaii Hurricane lines of business during this period. Our Residential Earthquake and Commercial Earthquake businesses are not subject to seasonality.

Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst Young LLP San Francisco, California March 1, 2023

Valuation of Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 91 

Table of Contents 
 Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) is 231,415 (in thousands). As explained in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for losses and LAE represents management s best estimate for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses on reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), net of salvage and subrogation recoveries. The liability is based on individual claims, case reserves and other estimates reported by policyholders, as well as management estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claims severity and frequency and other factors that could vary significantly as claims are settled. IBNR reserves include an estimate for future loss payments on incurred claims not yet reported and for expected development on reported claims. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management s best estimate of IBNR, which is sensitive to significant assumptions including the selection of actuarial methods and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Auditing management s best estimate of IBNR reserves was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions, including selection of actuarial methods and reported and paid loss emergence patterns, used in the valuation process. These assumptions have a significant effect on the valuation of reserves for IBNR claims. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over the process for estimating IBNR reserves. This included, among other procedures, testing management review controls in place over the review and approval of methods and assumptions used in estimating IBNR reserves. To test IBNR reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation by testing reconciliations of the underlying claims and policyholder data recorded in the source systems to the actuarial reserving calculations and comparing a sample of incurred and paid claims to source documentation. With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the Company s selection and weighting of actuarial methods compared to methods used in prior periods and in the industry for the specific types of insurance. To evaluate the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the assumptions to current and historical claims trends and to current industry benchmarks. We compared the Company s recorded reserves to a range of reasonable reserve estimates developed by our actuarial specialists based on independently selected methods and assumptions. We also compared the results of the reserve study prepared by a third-party actuarial firm to management s recorded reserve. Additionally, we performed a hindsight analysis of the prior period estimates using subsequent claims development. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016 March 1, 2023

During 2022, the net unfavorable reserve development was primarily attributable to prior year catastrophe events including certain 2020 Hurricanes, offset by favorable development related to 2021 attritional and catastrophe losses. During 2021, this net favorable reserve development was primarily due to the effect of ceding gross unfavorable development under our reinsurance program and lower than anticipated severity of catastrophe losses associated with certain hurricanes that occurred during the second half of 2020. During 2020, this favorable reserve development related to lower than anticipated frequency and severity of claims in our homeowners and special property lines of business offset by higher than anticipated frequency and severity of claims in our assumed reinsurance line. The Company compiles and aggregates its claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred Accident Year when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. For the purpose of defining claims frequency, the number of reported claims is by loss occurrence and includes claims that do not result in a liability or payment associated with them. The Company analyzed the usefulness of disaggregation of its results and determined the characteristics associated with the policies and the related unpaid loss reserves, incurred losses, and payment patterns are similar in nature. The Company separates its special property and other claim experience from its homeowner claim experience when analyzing losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid development and claim count triangles, as there are distinct differences in the development and claim count emergence patterns as well as methods of IBNR projection. The Special Property classification includes fire, allied lines, inland marine, and earthquake claims. As such, the following tables show the Company s historical homeowner and special property incurred and cumulative paid losses and LAE development, net of reinsurance, as well as IBNR loss reserves and the number of reported claims on an aggregate basis as of December 31, 2022 and for previous accident years.

This amount reflects gross and net reserves related to this treaty and the ultimate incurred amount reflects IBNR only. The Company does not have direct access to individual claim information underlying the assumed quota arrangement. The Company does not use claim frequency information in the determination of loss reserves or for other internal purposes. Based on these considerations, the Company does not believe providing claims frequency information is practicable as it relates to this line of business . million and million for hurricane and earthquake events. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s catastrophe event retention is million for all perils. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s XOL reinsurance structure provides protection up to billion for earthquake events, billion for Hawaii hurricane events, and million for continental U.S. hurricane events. In a quota share agreement, the Company transfers, or cedes, a portion of its premiums to reinsurers and, in return, the reinsurer must share an agreed upon portion of losses and pay a ceding commission to the Company. In a fronting agreement, the Company writes premium and then cedes the majority of the premium and risk in exchange for a fronting fee, which is the primary source of profit in the arrangement.

As part of its reinsurance program, in May 2017, the Company obtained catastrophe protection through a reinsurance agreement with Torrey Pines Re Ltd. TPRe ). In connection with the reinsurance agreement, TPRe issued notes to unrelated investors in an amount equal to the full million of coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement covering a three-year period, ending May 31, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company closed a million 144A catastrophe bond which became effective June 1, 2021. The catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Pte. Ltd.

 Assumed Ceded ) ) ) Net The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policy coverage, and therefore the Company will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. To minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurance insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk. To reduce credit exposure to reinsurance recoverable balances, the Company obtains letters of credit from certain reinsurers that are not authorized as reinsurers under U.S. state insurance regulations. In addition, under the terms of its reinsurance contracts, the Company may retain funds due from reinsurers as security for those recoverable balances. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had retained million and million in funds from reinsurers, respectively. The Company is able to use the funds in the ordinary course of its business.

 (1) Determined based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options. (2) Determined based on a blend of the Company s historic stock price volatility and the historic volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies. (3) Determined using the simplified method for estimating the expected option life, which is the average of the weighted-average vesting period and contractual term of the option as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its common stock has been publicly traded. (4) Determined to be as the Company does not currently plan to issue dividends. 
 Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units are valued on their grant date and generally vest either on the first anniversary of the grant date or over a period with one third vesting on each anniversary date, subject to continued service with the Company.

Performance Stock Units PSUs The Company issues PSUs to employees with a combination of service, performance, and market conditions. The majority of PSUs were issued pursuant to the 2021 Executive Stock Grants, as described below. For other PSU grants, vesting of PSUs requires a period of future service and the number of shares that vest depends on performance relative to predetermined targets of the Company s Gross Written Premiums and Adjusted Return on Equity as set by the Compensation Committee. The PSU s performance period is the fiscal year of the grant. At the end of the performance period, the actual results will be measured against the predetermined targets to determine the number of PSUs to be earned as compensation.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors. Based on that assessment under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation
