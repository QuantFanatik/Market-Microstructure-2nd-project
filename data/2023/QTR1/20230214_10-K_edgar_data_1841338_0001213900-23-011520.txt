any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements that are

may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to:

 our initial business combination (as defined below), including the Zapp Business Combination (as defined below); 

our success in retaining
 or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;

 obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the Zapp Business Combination; 

the ability of our officers
 and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities if we do not close the Zapp Business Combination;

on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number
of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. While we may pursue an
initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry or sector, we have focused our search
in the technology, media and telecommunications industries and on companies with sustainability business models TMTS that are enabled by technology. 

Our sponsor is an entity
that was formed by our management team. We believe our management team s extensive operational and financial experience coupled
with their experience in identifying and executing acquisitions globally with a collectively vast network to source and structure additional
acquisition opportunities, make us attractive in the marketplace. Although we may pursue our initial business combination with a private
or public target in any business, industry or geographic location, we have focused on opportunities to capitalize on the ability of our
management team, particularly our executive officers, to identify, acquire and operate a business in the TMTS industries. 

Initial Public Offering 

On September 17, 2021, we
consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of
one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock
for 11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 287,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 12,062,500 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price
of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 12,062,500. 

A total of 291,812,500,
comprised of 287,500,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement
warrants was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 

It is the job of our sponsor
and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Peter Cuneo, our Executive Chairman,
Gavin Cuneo, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Minnick, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, who have many years of experience,
relationships and connectivity in the TMTS sector. We must complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period
on March 17, 2023, 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (September 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate
our initial business combination). If our initial business combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, then
our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.

November 22, 2022, the Company entered into the Zapp Merger Agreement with Zapp, Pubco and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Zapp Merger Agreement,

Our Management Team 

The members of our management
team, including Peter Cuneo, our Executive Chairman, and our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Gavin Cuneo and Michael Minnick, have
experience operating a SPAC and consummating a business combination. 

In December 2019, Messrs.
Peter Cuneo, Gavin Cuneo and Michael Minnick, founded CIIG Merger Corp., or CIIC, a blank check merger company formed for the purpose
of effecting a business combination. CIIC completed its initial public offering in December 2019, generating gross proceeds of 258,750,000.
In March 2021 CIIC, closed its initial business combination with Arrival Group (Nasdaq: ARVL), the global technology company creating
electric vehicles. As part of the transaction, CIIC raised a 400 million fully committed common stock PIPE that was anchored by
Fidelity Management Research Company LLC, Wellington Management, BNP Paribas Asset Management Energy Transition Fund, and
funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. 

The members of our management
team are identical to the management of CIIC. Our management team members have an average of 35 years of operating and transactional
expertise as well as each having a broad industry network that encompasses a wide array of subsectors within the TMTS industries. Each
member of the team has value creation credentials across a variety of sectors and has a track record of senior leadership success in
diverse organizations and situations. Our management team s relationships and experience create a powerful foundation that extends
globally across various TMTS sectors. Our management team has previously demonstrated its capabilities in providing creative solutions
for complex transactions using the complementary skill sets of its members and its multi-disciplinary approach to investment opportunities.
Our management team has a long-term professional relationship with one another, and plans to be active with deal sourcing, evaluating
targets and facilitating transactions. We believe this integrated platform affords our management team the ability to identify sizable
investment opportunities ahead of several leading private equity funds, strategic companies, and investment bankers. 

Our management team combines
a broad array of resources and backgrounds, including experience in the following: 

sourcing, structuring,
 acquiring and selling businesses; 

operating companies as
 executives and active board members, and setting clear and effective business strategies for companies in TMTS and other industries; 

strategic insight from
 mergers and acquisitions and capital structure capabilities based on debt and equity capital executions; 

delivering stockholder
 value over an extended time period in the top quartile of equity investment returns; 

4 

deploying a broad value
 creation toolkit including identifying value enhancements and delivering operating efficiency; and 

accessing the capital markets
 across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with the transition to public ownership. 

This experience is supplemented
with an in-depth network of relationships that extend to strategic companies across various TMTS verticals as well as to private
equity sponsors including bulge-bracket and TMTS sector focused funds. Our management team also has contacts with leading institutional
investors including pension and sovereign wealth funds. 

Market Opportunity 

Our focus has been and will
continue to be on the TMT sector and on companies with sustainability business models enabled by technology, collectively termed as the
TMTS sector. Each member of our management team has expertise, relationships and connectivity in the TMTS sector. Additionally, the TMTS
sector benefits from positive macroeconomic trends, considerable capital allocation and substantial actionable targets of meaningful
scale that fit our acquisition criteria. We believe changes occurring within the TMT sector are propelling this strategic activity. For
instance, technology advancements and over-the-top content providers have caused what we believe are massive shifts in the media
sector as key players look to consolidate and scale in order to compete. Similarly, new technologies have reduced barriers to entry,
introducing increased, low-cost competition, and the need for strategic actions to address growing structural challenges. Additionally,
the telecommunications industry is facing significant consolidation and increased spending as the next generation of wireless and broadband
technology nears. These critical themes in TMT, among many, provide what we believe is a strong environment for sourcing a differentiated
opportunity and consummating a business combination. 

Sustainability is being driven
by technology, technological advancements and societal change. By way of extension, we naturally see many attractive opportunities such
as Zapp within our core TMT mandate that are principally aligned with themes in sustainability. Complementary to TMT sector-specific opportunities,
we are targeting opportunities and companies such as Zapp that have existing environmental sustainability practices or that may benefit,
both operationally and economically, from our management team s commitment and expertise in executing such practices. We believe
there are significant attractive investment opportunities that drive more favorable investor sentiment and benefit due to their strong
Environmental, Social and Governance ESG profiles. Our target universe could also include companies undergoing a transition
to increase their sustainability profiles, reflecting an opportunity to bring environmentally sustainable practices to companies that
may or may not have historically been focused on environmental sustainability. 

We believe there is a large
universe of market-leading private companies, with environmental sustainability practices in place or are undergoing a transition
to increase their sustainability profiles, which will benefit greatly from access to public markets and a partnership with a platform
such as ours. While our target opportunity set captures a broad range of business profiles, we have identified several specific sustainability
sectors on which we are focusing, including, but not limited to, waste water management, decarbonization initiatives, renewable energy
and digital twin technologies. 

Business Strategy 

We seek to identify TMTS
companies, such as Zapp, that demonstrate significant growth potential and/or value creation opportunities. Identified target companies,
such as Zapp, may demonstrate the characteristics set out under Acquisition Criteria below. Our experience in identifying
and capitalizing on previously underappreciated macroeconomic trends and market dislocations, in addition to our high caliber industry
relationships, provides a competitive advantage in identifying these potential targets. 

We conduct diligence on targets,
establishing the intrinsic worth of the business while providing for our ability to effect change to unlock value. While our approach
has focused and will continue to focus on industries where we have differentiated insights, we can also help businesses implement change
through a comprehensive value creation framework. We favor opportunities with strong fundamental platforms that can provide downside
protection while our efforts focus on improving the risk-reward investment profile by accelerating the target s growth initiatives. 

To achieve a successful initial
business combination, our management team deploys a proactive sourcing strategy and will create value in the public markets after the
initial combination by serving as active owners/directors of the acquired business. We believe the combination of our management team s
experience in and ability to maneuver through industry cycles, sub-verticals and across geographies within the TMTS sector, proprietary
deal flow, and professional relationships will allow us to identify an attractive acquisition target. Then through our operational experience,
by working closely with the target business, we can act as a catalyst to enhance its growth potential and value in order to realize an
attractive risk-adjusted return to our stockholders. 

5 

Acquisition Criteria 

We have sought to identify
companies that have compelling growth potential and a combination of the characteristics outlined below. We have used and will continue
to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, such as Zapp, but we may decide to enter into our initial
business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or assets
that we believe have the following attributes: 

are in the TMTS sectors
 where we can utilize our management team s global network of contacts to effect necessary change; 

are at an inflection point,
 requiring additional management expertise to reinvigorate operations, facilitate growth, improve financial performance and optimize
 capital structure; 

are fundamentally sound,
 with strong underlying free cash flow or strong cash flow potential, an experienced management team and which demonstrate strong
 or improving growth prospects and the potential to scale via organic growth and strategic action, or are underperforming what we
 believe to be their potential; 

exhibit unrecognized value
 or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company s growth strategy, that
 we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; 

can offer an attractive
 long term risk-adjusted return for our stockholders, provide potential upside from incremental growth and offer an improved
 capital structure, all of which will be weighed against any identified downside risks; 

benefit from being positioned
 as a public company and gaining access to the capital markets; 

can benefit from product
 extensions and/or geographic expansion; 

maintain competitive market
 positions while exhibiting operational efficiencies relative to industry peers; 

that offer scope for operational
 improvement, scale economics, sector convergence opportunities, new growth avenues and margin expansion efficiencies; 

have existing operating
 practices that promote and profit from environmental sustainability or would benefit from implementing environmentally sustainable
 commercial and operating practices; and 

are well positioned to
 capitalize on market opportunities associated with seismic shifts and pivot to sustainable energy consumption in-line with global
 public policy. 

These criteria are not intended
to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant,
on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event
that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines,
we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business
combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that
we would file with the SEC, such as the Zapp Registration Statement. 

Initial Business Combination 

Our initial business combination
must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the assets held in
the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the
time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market
value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of
FINRA, or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with
a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination
must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors,
we have determined that the fair market value of Zapp was in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test was
therefore satisfied. 

6 

We have until March 17, 2023
to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination
by March 17, 2023, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional six
months (or until September 17, 2023 to complete a business combination); provided that our sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into
the trust account funds equal to one percent (1.0 of the gross proceeds of the offering for such extension, in exchange for a non-interest bearing,
unsecured promissory note. Such loan may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such
time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding
public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including
any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and net of interest that may be used by us to pay our taxes, and less up to
 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish the public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if
any), subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. The pro rata redemption price
is approximately 10.30 per public share as of December 31, 2022, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However,
we cannot assure you that we will in fact, be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors, which may take priority
over the claims of our public stockholders. 

Our public stockholders will
not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination from March 17, 2023 to
September 17, 2023 described above or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. However, our public stockholders will be
entitled to vote and/or redeem their shares in connection with a stockholder meeting held to approve an initial business combination
or in a tender offer undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during
any 6-month extension period. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement
entered into between us and Continental on the date of the IPO Registration Statement, in order for the time available for us to consummate
our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the
deadline, must deposit into the trust account an aggregate of 2,587,500 on or prior to the date of the deadline, for such extension.
Any such payments would be made in the form of a non-interest bearing loan which would be due and payable on the consummation of
our initial business combination out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Such loan may be convertible into warrants,
at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. If we
do not complete a business combination, we may repay such loans solely from assets not held in the trust account, if any. 

In the event that we receive
notice from our sponsor five days prior to the deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release
announcing such intention at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the
deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or permitted designees are not
obligated to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 

We may, at our option, pursue
an acquisition opportunity jointly with members of our management team (or their affiliates, including IIG Holdings), which we refer
to as an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of
our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class
of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers,
as a specified future issuance throughout this Report. 

The amount and other terms
and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified
future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions
of our Class B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that
our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20 of the sum
of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of our initial public offering plus all shares issued in
the specified future issuance (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller in the initial
business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agreed to waive
such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority
of the holders of our Class B common stock at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment
to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of
holders of our Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage ownership of our public stockholders. If such adjustment is
waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock. 

Our Acquisition Process 

We believe that conducting
comprehensive due diligence on prospective investments, such as Zapp, is particularly important within the TMTS industries. We utilize
the diligence, rigor, and expertise of our management team to evaluate potential targets strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities
to seek to identify the relative risk and return profile of any potential target for our initial business combination. Given our management
team s extensive tenure investing in the TMTS industries, we expect to often be familiar with the prospective target s end-market,
competitive landscape and business model. 

In evaluating a prospective
initial business combination, such as Zapp, we conduct a thorough diligence review that encompasses, among other things, meetings with
incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, and financial analyses as well as a review of other information
that will be made available to us. 

7 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, our officers, or our directors, or any of
their respective affiliates, subject to certain approvals and consents. While Zapp is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors
in the event that we do not consummate the Zapp Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a
company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, we, or a committee of independent directors,
will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that
our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. Currently, we are not aware of an affiliate of such parties
that would make a suitable target for our initial business combination. 

Each of our officers and
directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant
to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers
or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such
entity. One of our officers is the managing member of IIG Holdings. IIG Holdings is continuously made aware of potential investment opportunities,
one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint
Acquisition opportunity with IIG Holdings or another entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation.
Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise
additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. 

Members of our management
team may become officers or directors of other SPACs before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business
combination. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure
as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Zapp. As an existing public company,
we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination.
In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock
or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See
 Zapp Business Combination above for more information regarding such exchanges in the Zapp Business Combination. Although
there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses such as Zapp will find this
method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial
public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present
to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed
business combination is completed, such as the Zapp Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas
an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions,
which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target
business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders 
interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in
attracting talented employees. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following September 17, 2026, (b) in which
we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the
prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain
reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain
a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds
 250 million as of the end of the prior June 30 th , or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during
such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior
June 30 th . To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial
statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.

Financial Position 

With funds available for a
business combination in the amount of approximately 296 million as of December 31, 2022 which amount includes 10,062,500 of deferred
underwriting fees and excludes fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business, such as
Zapp, a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion
of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business
combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient
combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we
have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to complete our initial
business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants,
our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to
complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development
or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which
may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather
than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete
such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded
with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would
disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no
prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection
with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with
respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 

The time required to structure
and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree
of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business
combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another
business combination. 

See Zapp Business
Combination above for more information regarding the financing of and the agreements related to the Zapp Business Combination. 

Sources of Target Businesses 

We expect to receive a number
of proprietary transaction opportunities, such as Zapp, to originate as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and
deal sourcing activities of our management team. In addition to the proprietary deal flow, target business candidates may be brought
to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity
groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which
they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus for our initial public
offering or this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our management team, as well as some of their affiliates,
may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal
or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. Some of our officers and directors
may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination.
The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any
finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), except that at the closing of our initial business
combination, we may pay a customary financial consulting fee to IIG Holdings, or another affiliate of our sponsor, which will not be
made from the proceeds of our initial public offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial
or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate
and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing
market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant
to the audit committee s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. 

9 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors
or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. While Zapp
is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event that we do not consummate the Zapp Business Combination and we
seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or
directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is
a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial
point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial
business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of
a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting
such business combination opportunity to us. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial
business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any
such entity. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period
of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we have focused our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing
our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative
 economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry
 in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend on the
 marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of Zapp, when evaluating the desirability of effecting
our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Zapp Business Combination is not consummated and we
seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In
addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any
certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business
combination, including the Zapp Business Combination in which Patricia Wilber and Kenneth West, two of the our current directors, will
serve on the board of directors of Pubco, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent
to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge
relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will
remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

At the consummation of the
Zapp Business Combination, Patricia Wilber and Kenneth West, two of the Company s current directors, will serve on the board of
directors of Pubco.Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers
to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional
managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required
by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case with the Zapp Business Combination as currently contemplated), or we may decide
to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types
of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such
transaction. 

10 

Type of Transaction 
 Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of the company with a target 
 Yes 

Under Nasdaq s listing
rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue shares of Class A
 common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; 

any of our directors, officers
 or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or
 greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential
 issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential
 issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

See Zapp Business
Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Zapp Business Combination. 

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 

In the event we seek stockholder
approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender
offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, as of the date hereof,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions
for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not
make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such
stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise
its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders
would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any,
would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject
to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the
purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 

The purpose of such purchases
would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder
approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would
otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

In addition, if such purchases
are made, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may
be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities
exchange. 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates
may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests
submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent
that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only
potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or
vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such
purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

11 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only
be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for
manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements
that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their
affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act. 

See Zapp Business
Combination above for more information regarding such purchases in the Zapp Business Combination. 

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders
upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as
of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the Zapp Business Combination, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately
 10.30 per public share and such amount may be increased by 0.10 per public share for the 6-month extension of our time to consummate
our initial business combination, as described in this Report. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly
redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers
and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect
to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our
initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination, such
as the Zapp Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer if the Zapp Business Combination is not consummated. The decision
as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely
in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction
would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases
would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where
we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require
stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder
approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We intend
to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required
by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long
as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 

If a stockholder vote is
not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions
 pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents
 with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information
 about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates
 the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement
of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase
shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply
with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

In the event that we conduct
redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration
of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified
number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem
our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to
or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are
not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained
in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase,
we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

12 

If, however, stockholder
approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for
business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions
 in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies,
 and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with
 the SEC. 

In the event that we seek
stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our
public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If we seek stockholder approval,
unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, we will complete our initial business combination only
if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting
will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority
of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our sponsor, officers
and directors will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after
our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking such approval, unless otherwise required
by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination
once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our sponsor, officers and directors founder shares, and shares of Class
A common stock purchased by our anchor investors in the initial public offering, we need 8,625,001, or 30 , of the 28,750,000 public
shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted); or 1,796,876,
or 6.25 of the 28,750,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming only the
minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. In addition, as
a result of the founder shares and private placement warrants that our anchor investors may hold indirectly, they may have different
interests with respect to a vote on an initial business combination than other public stockholders. We intend to give approximately 30 days
(but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall
be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our sponsor, officers
and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to
redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible
assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment
of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater
net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example,
the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to
be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other
conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would
be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to
satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us,
we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption
will be returned to the holders thereof. 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion
of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an
aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe
this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use
their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to
purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision,
a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise
its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market
price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold in our
initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability
to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
does not restrict our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. 

See Zapp Business
Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Zapp Business Combination. 

13 

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection
with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We may require our public
stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders,
or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials,
or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder s option. The tender offer
or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination
will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would
have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the
vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise
its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their
public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System.
The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost
on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption
rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of
when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and
a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking
to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to
arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option
window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s
stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually
delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they
needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business
combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting
ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or our proxy materials, as applicable.
Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently
decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return
the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing
to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If the Zapp Business Combination
is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the end of the Combination
Period. 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
if no Initial Business Combination 

Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until the end of the Combination Period to complete our initial business
combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all
operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining
stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by the end of the Combination
Period. 

14 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them
if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period. However, if our sponsor, officers, directors
or anchor investors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination
Period. 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us (filed as an exhibit to the IPO Registration Statement), that they will
not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, unless
we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such
amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least
 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters 
fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right
is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described
above) we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares. 

If we do not consummate the
Zapp Business Combination or any other initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to
any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately 42,858 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of
December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest
accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee
to release to us an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.30. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you
that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.30. Under Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made
in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our
remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient
to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we seek to have
all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us
waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public
stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be
prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility
or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with
respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement
waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to
it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s
engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third
party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed
by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Grant Thornton, our independent registered public accounting firm will
not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor will the underwriters of our initial
public offering. 

15 

In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) 10.15
per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust
account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes,
except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as
to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will
not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor,
which is a newly formed entity, has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets
are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust
account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.30 per public share.
In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in
connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without
limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.30 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the
independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome
is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the
per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.30 per public share. 

We have sought and will continue
to seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring
to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements
with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not
be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have access to up to approximately 42,858 from the proceeds of our
initial public offering with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined
that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for
claims made by creditors. As of December 31, 2022, the amount held outside of the trust account was 42,858. 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our business combination by the end of the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable
provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting
period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution
is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any
liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

Furthermore, if the pro rata
portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete
our business combination by the end of the Combination Period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such
redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims
of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating
distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all
operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining
stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as
soon as reasonably possible following March 17, 2023 (or September 17, 2023, if applicable) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply
with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by
them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

16 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will
provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent
10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to
searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result
of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result
in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that
the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.30 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case
net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third-party claims. 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.30 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you
that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only on the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our
initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end
of the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business
combination activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by the end
of the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. Stockholders who do not exercise their rights to the funds in connection with an
amendment to our certificate of incorporation would still have rights to the funds in connection with a subsequent business combination.
In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek
stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the business
combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account.
Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. 

17 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our business combination, such as Zapp, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense
competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups
and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited
by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the
resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially
represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage
in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We currently have three officers.
These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they
deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period
will vary based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees
prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

Our units, Class A common
stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that
we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports,
including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

We will provide stockholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business, including the Zapp Registration Statement. In all likelihood, these
financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business
selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or that the
potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To the extent that this requirement
cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates,
we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal
control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy
of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

18 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors
in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect
on the Company and its operations: 

we
are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, including the Zapp Business Combination, in the prescribed time frame; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, including Zapp, may not be realized; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain additional
 financing to complete our initial business combination, including the Zapp Business Combination, or reduce the number of
 stockholders requesting redemption; 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination; 

if we fail to complete the Zapp Business Combination, we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability; 

we may attempt to complete our initial business
 combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company
 that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

19 

since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination; 

changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per share; 

resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.30 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless; 

in March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

to mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on the funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; 

we may not be able to
 complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies, including Zapp, if a proposed transaction with the
 target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or
 regulations; 

recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

a 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption; and 

there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

20 

We
intend to file the Zapp Registration Statement in connection with the Zapp Business Combination, in which risks related to Zapp, the
Zapp Business Combination and the post-combination company will be included. 

For the complete list of
risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) IPO Registration Statement,
(ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022, and (iii) Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022, August
15, 2022, and November 14, 2022, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial
business combination. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings
with the SEC. 

For risks relating to Zapp
and the Zapp Business Combination, please see the Zapp Registration Statement once filed.

Statements 

All statements other than

position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used
in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend 
and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements
are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual
results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in
our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the
notes related thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 

22 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 6, 2021 for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. We intend
to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering initial public offering and
the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We expect to continue to
incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial business
combination will be successful. 

Zapp Business Combination 

On November 22, 2022, the
Company, Zapp, Pubco and Merger Sub entered into the Zapp Merger Agreement pursuant to which (i) Pubco, Zapp and certain shareholders
of Zapp entered into an Investor Exchange and Support Agreement or a Management Exchange and Support Agreement, pursuant to which such
shareholders will transfer their respective ordinary shares of Zapp to Pubco in exchange for Pubco common shares and (ii) immediately
thereafter, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation and each outstanding share
of Company common stock (other than certain excluded shares) converting into the right to receive one Pubco common share as set forth
in the Zapp Merger Agreement. 

The Zapp Business Combination
is expected to be consummated after the required approval by the stockholders of the Company and the satisfaction of other conditions
as further described in the Zapp Merger Agreement. For a full description of the Zapp Merger Agreement and the proposed Zapp Business
Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in
any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from January 6, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering, described below, and identifying a target company
for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business
combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account. We incur
expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due
diligence expenses. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, we had a net loss of 1,716,378, which consists of formation and operational costs of 5,493,089 and provision for income taxes
of 906,414, offset by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 4,683,125. 

For the period from January
6, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 1,518,280, which consists of formation and operational costs of
 1,548,562, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 30,282. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On September 17, 2021, we
consummated the initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment
option in the amount of 3,750,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 287,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 12,062,500 private placement warrants at a price of 1.00 per private placement
warrant in a private placement to the sponsor generating gross proceeds of 12,062,500. 

Following the initial public
offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of 291,812,500 was
placed in the trust account. We incurred 16,342,432 in initial public offering related costs, including 5,750,000 of underwriting fees
and 529,932 of other offering costs. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was 1,355,363. Net loss of 1,716,378 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable
securities held in the trust account of 4,683,125 and deferred tax provision 502,902. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided
 4,541,238 of cash from operating activities. 

For the period from January
6, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was 836,504. Net loss of 1,518,280 was affected by
interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 30,282. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 712,058
of cash from operating activities. 

As of December 31, 2022,
we had marketable securities held in the trust account of 295,886,250 (including approximately 4,683,125 of interest income) consisting
of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to
pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we withdrew 639,657 interest earned from the trust account. 

23 

We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less income taxes
payable and deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or
debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the
trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of December 31, 2022,
we had cash of 42,858. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses,
perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses,
and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination. 

In order to fund working
capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the sponsor, or certain of our
officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial
business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, we may use
a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would
be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be converted into warrants of the post initial business
combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. 

On December 15, 2022, we
executed the Convertible Note with the sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 100,000. The
Convertible Note is non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of March 17, 2023 and the date that we consummate our business combination.
In the event that we do not consummate a business combination, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside of the trust
account to repay such additional loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 100,000
of such additional loans (if any) may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the sponsor. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
issuance of the Convertible Note was approved by our board of directors and the audit committee on December 15, 2022. The conversion
feature was reviewed under ASC 815 and noted no conditions that would require bifurcation of the conversion feature. As of December 31,
2022, there was 100,000 outstanding under the Convertible Note. 

We will need to raise additional
capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers.
Our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from
time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly,
we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional
measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit
of a potential transaction and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

In connection with our assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Basis of Presentation Going Concern, 
management has determined that the expected shortfall in working capital over the period of time between the date the financial statements
are issued and our estimated initial business combination date raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or the date we are required to liquidate. Based on the above
factors, management determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if we are unable
to continue as a going concern. Our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet
our working capital needs. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased
any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than our agreement to pay an affiliate of
the sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these
fees on September 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the initial business
combination and our liquidation. 

24 

The underwriters are entitled
to a deferred fee of 0.35 per unit, or 10,062,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the
amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that the Company completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms
of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified
the following critical accounting policies: 

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible
Redemption 

We account for our Class
A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the
control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as
temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain
redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,
shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit
section of our balance sheets. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock 

Net loss per share of common
stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
We have two classes of common stock, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Income and losses are shared
pro rata between the two classes of common stock. This presentation contemplates an initial business combination as the most likely outcome,
in which case, both classes of common stock share pro rata in our loss. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common
stock is excluded from income (loss) per share of common stock as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the FASB
issued ASU Topic 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under
current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted
ASU 2020-06 effective as of January 6, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our financial statements. 

Management does not believe
that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations 

Our results of operations
and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty
and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things,
downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply
chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences
and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully
predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact
our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-21 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
Co-Chief Executive Officers (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based
on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures,
no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies
and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
 effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

26 

Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information. 

On December 15, 2022, we
executed the Convertible Note with the sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 100,000. The
Convertible Note is non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of March 17, 2023 and the date that we consummate our business combination.
In the event that we do not consummate a business combination, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside of the trust
account to repay such additional loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 100,000
of such additional loans (if any) may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the sponsor. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
issuance of the Convertible Note was approved by our board of directors and the audit committee on December 15, 2022. The conversion
feature was reviewed under ASC 815 and noted no conditions that would require bifurcation of the conversion feature. As of December 31,
2022, there was 100,000 outstanding under the Convertible Note.

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We currently have seven directors.
Holders of our founder shares have the right to elect all of our directors prior to consummation of our initial business combination
and holders of our public shares will not have the right to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by at least 90 of our common stock voting at a stockholder
meeting. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class
(except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. The term of
office of the first class of directors, consisting of Mr. West and Rogers, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders.
The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Mr. Flowers and Ms. Wilber, will expire at the second annual
meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Cuneo, Cuneo and Minnick, will expire
at the third annual meeting of stockholders. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate our initial
business combination. 

Our officers are appointed
by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board
of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that
our officers may consist of one or more Chairmen of the Board, one or more Chief Executive Officers, a President, a Chief Financial Officer,
Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the
rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely
of independent directors, and the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of
independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board and has the composition and responsibilities
described below. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. West, Flowers and Rogers serve as members of our audit committee with Mr. Flowers as chair.
Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all
of whom must be independent, subject to certain phase-in provisions. Messrs. West, Flowers and Rogers meet the independent director
standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit
committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Flowers qualifies as an audit committee
financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the appointment, compensation,
 retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting
 firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all
 audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting
 firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

reviewing and discussing
 with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence; 

setting clear hiring policies
 for employees or former employees of the independent auditors; 

30 

setting clear policies
 for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing
 a report, at least annually, from the independent auditors describing (i) the independent auditor s internal quality-control procedures
 and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm,
 or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or
 more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues; 

reviewing and approving
 any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior
 to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management,
 the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence
 with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our
 financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial
 Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established
a compensation committee of the board of directors. Mr. Rogers and Ms. Wilber serve as members of our compensation committee.
Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee,
all of whom must be independent, subject to certain phase-in provisions. Mr. Rogers and Ms. Wilber meet the independent
director standard under Nasdaq listing standards applicable to members of the compensation committee. 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which will detail the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating
our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration
(if any) of our Chief Executive Officers based on such evaluations; 

reviewing
and approving on an annual basis the compensation of all of our other officers; 

reviewing
on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing
and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting
management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving
all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if
required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing,
evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as indicated above, other than the payment to an affiliate of our sponsor of 10,000 per month, until March 17, 2023 (or September 17,
2023, if applicable), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation
of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers,
directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to complete the consummation of a
business combination, except that at the closing of our initial business combination, we may pay a customary financial consulting fee
to IIG Holdings, or another affiliate of our sponsor, which will not be made from the proceeds of our initial public offering held in
the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event
such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships,
services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The
amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions
at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee s policies and procedures
relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements
to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

31 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel
or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of
Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit and compensation
committee charters as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement. You can review these documents by accessing our public filings at the
SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request
from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities
to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities.
These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies
of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations
from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2022, all reports applicable to our executive officers,
directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
except as set forth below: 

During the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, Ms. Wilber, a member of the board of directors, failed to timely file one Form 3. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 

None of our officers or directors
has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and we will continue to do so through the earlier of the consummation of
our initial business combination and our liquidation. No compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, has
been or will be paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or
in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, except that at the closing of our initial business combination,
we may pay a customary financial consulting fee to IIG Holdings, or another affiliate of our sponsor, which will not be made from the
proceeds of our initial public offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We may
pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or
market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate
and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing
market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant
to the audit committee s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. However, these
individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly
basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. 

After the completion
of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management
fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer
materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. 

We have not established any
limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the
amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business
will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined,
or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors
or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

Following a business combination,
to the extent we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target
business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the
requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February 14, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons
named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each person known by us
 to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

each of our executive officers
 and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all our executive officers
 and directors as a group. 

In the table below, percentage
ownership is based on 35,937,500 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 28,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock and (ii)
7,187,500 shares of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of February 14, 2023. On all matters to be voted upon, except
for the election of directors of the board, holders of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together
as a single class. Currently, all of the shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

Unless otherwise indicated,
we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially
owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants
are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence. 

In January 2021, our
sponsor acquired 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000. In July 2021, our sponsor forfeited 2,156,250 founder
shares, resulting in our sponsor holding 6,468,750 founder shares, up to 843,750 of which were subject to forfeiture. Prior to the initial
investment in the company of 25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The number of founder shares
issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion
of our initial public offering. In September 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 0.11111111 shares for each founder share outstanding,
resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate number of 7,187,500 founder shares. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the share cancellation. As a result of the underwriters election to fully exercise their over-allotment option
at the close of the initial public offering, a total of 937,500 founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. 

Our sponsor and the direct
anchor investors have purchased an aggregate of 12,062,500 private placement warrants for a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant in a
private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, generating gross proceeds of 12,062,500.
Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at 11.50 per share. The private
placement warrants (including the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of extension loans and Working Capital Loans and the Class A
common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold
by the holder. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our founder shares or warrants, which
will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the Combination Period. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she
has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations
to other entities that may take priority over their duties to us. We may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity
with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us
in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition
by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. 

34 

We will have until March
17, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial
business combination by March 17, 2023, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination
by an additional six months (until September 17, 2023), for a total of up to 24 months to complete a business combination); provided
that our sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the trust account funds equal to one percent (1.0 of the gross proceeds of the
offering for such extension, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Such loan may be convertible into
warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
Our public stockholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination
from 18 months to 24 months described above or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. However, our public stockholders
will be entitled to vote and/or redeem their shares in connection with a stockholder meeting held to approve an initial business combination
or in a tender offer undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during
any 6-month extension period. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement
entered into between us and Continental on the date of the IPO Registration Statement, in order for the time available for us to consummate
our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the
deadline, must deposit into the trust account an aggregate of 2,587,500 on or prior to the date of the deadline, for such extension.
Any such payments would be made in the form of a non-interest bearing loan which would be due and payable on the consummation of
our initial business combination out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 

No compensation of any kind,
including finder s and consulting fees, has been or will be paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination, except that at the
closing of our initial business combination, we may pay a customary financial consulting fee to IIG Holdings, or another affiliate of
our sponsor, which will not be made from the proceeds of our initial public offering held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination. We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific
target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are
necessary in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee
we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to
the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present
conflicts of interest. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates
and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

We pay an affiliate of our
sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

On February 26, 2021, the
sponsor agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to the initial public offering (the Promissory
Note ). The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of September 30, 2021 or the completion of the initial
public offering. We borrowed a total of 167,417 under the Promissory Note, which was repaid on September 20, 2021. In addition, in order
to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used
for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of
the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors,
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide
a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

On December 15, 2022, we
executed the Convertible Note with the sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 100,000. The
Convertible Note is non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of March 17, 2023 and the date that we consummate our business combination.
In the event that we do not consummate a business combination, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside of the trust
account to repay such additional loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 100,000
of such additional loans (if any) may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the sponsor. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
issuance of the Convertible Note was approved by our board of directors and the audit committee on December 15, 2022. The conversion
feature was reviewed under ASC 815 and noted no conditions that would require bifurcation of the conversion feature. As of December 31,
2022, there was 100,000 outstanding under the Convertible Note. 

35 

After our initial business
combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company
with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation
materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of
distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination,
as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 

We have entered into a registration
rights agreement with respect to the founder shares, the private placement warrants, the warrants that may be issued upon conversion
of extension loans and Working Capital Loans (and their respective component securities) and the shares of Class A common stock
issuable upon conversion of the founder shares.

require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person
other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion
of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out
the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. West, Flowers and Rogers and Ms. Wilber are independent
directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our audit committee is entirely composed of independent
directors meeting Nasdaq s additional requirements applicable to members of the audit committee. Our independent directors have
regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

Board of Directors and Stockholders 
CIIG Capital Partners II, Inc. 

Opinion on the financial statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of CIIG Capital Partners
II, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 6, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 6, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company expects a working capital
shortfall during the period of twelve months from the issuance date of the financial statements or through completion of a Business Combination,
if sooner. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

Trust Account will initially be approximately per Public Share and such amount may be increased by per Public Share for
a 6-month extension of time to consummate the Business Combination, as described herein. The per-share amount to be distributed to public
stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the
underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect

not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior
to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides
to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation
pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with
a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note
5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally,

Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will
seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to
have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements

shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are
permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same
taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.
