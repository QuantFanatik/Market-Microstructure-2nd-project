 PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

A. INTRODUCTION 
 
 In this report, when we refer to "us," "we," "our," or "ours," we are referring to Wisconsin Public Service Corporation. The term "utility" refers to our regulated activities, while the term "non-utility" refers to our activities that are not regulated. References to "Notes" are to the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We are an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group and were incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1883. We serve customers in northeastern and central Wisconsin. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. 
 
 For more information about our utility operations, including financial and geographic information, see Note 20, Segment Information, and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations. For information about our business strategy, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Corporate Developments. 
 
 Available Information 
 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are made available on WEC Energy Group's website, www.wecenergygroup.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. 

B. UTILITY SEGMENT 

Electric Utility Operations 
 
 We generate and distribute electric energy to customers located in northeastern and central Wisconsin. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 For information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, see Note 4, Operating Revenues. 
 
 Electric Sales 
 
 Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail, wholesale, and resale customers. In 2022, retail revenues accounted for 89.4 of total electric operating revenues, wholesale revenues accounted for 7.2 of total electric operating revenues, and resale revenues accounted for 2.1 of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Utility Segment Contribution to Net Income for information on MWh sales by customer class. 
 
 We are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. 
 
 We buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets compared to our competitors affects how often our generating units are dispatched and whether we buy or sell power, based on our customers' needs. We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. For more information, see D. Regulation. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 3 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 The majority of our sales for resale are sold into an energy market operated by MISO at market rates based on the availability of our generation and market demand. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales. 
 
 Electric Sales Forecast 
 
 Our service territory experienced lower weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2022, compared with 2021. Weather-normalized sales to residential and commercial and industrial customers were above pre-pandemic 2019 levels. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes to grow at an annual rate between 0.7 and 1.0 for the period 2025 through 2027, assuming normal weather. Electric peak demand is expected to be flat over the same period. 
 
 Customers 
 Year Ended December 31 (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Electric customers end of year Residential 405.6 401.7 398.3 Small commercial and industrial 55.4 55.0 54.7 Large commercial and industrial 0.2 0.2 0.2 Total electric customers end of year 461.2 456.9 453.2 
 
 Electric Commercial and Industrial Retail Customers 
 
 We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in industries such as paper, metals and other manufacturing, utilities, food products, and governmental. 
 
 Electric Generation and Supply Mix 
 
 Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to balance a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity with environmental stewardship. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term purchase power agreements and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess power supply into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 
 
 The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years ended December 31, as well as estimates for 2023: 
 Estimate (1) 
 Actual 2023 2022 2021 2020 Company-owned generation units: Coal 33.3 34.2 39.4 34.5 Natural gas combined cycle 31.4 31.8 31.0 31.9 Natural gas/oil peaking units 2.6 3.1 2.5 1.4 Renewables (2)

 (1) The values included in the estimate assume a natural gas price based on the December 2022 NYMEX. 
 
 (2) Includes hydroelectric, solar, and wind generation. 
 
 Electric Generation Facilities 
 
 Our generation portfolio is a mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to balance providing energy that is stable, reliable, and affordable with environmental stewardship. We own 2,475 MW of generation capacity, including wholly owned and jointly owned facilities. Our facilities include coal-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants, and renewable generation. Certain of our natural gas-fired generation units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our facilities, see Item 2. Properties. 
 
 Environmental Goals 
 
 WEC Energy Group has set goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from its electric generation fleet, which includes us, by 60 by the end of 2025 and by 80 by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. WEC Energy Group expects to achieve these goals by making operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing its capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for WEC Energy Group's generation fleet is net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. 
 
 By the end of 2030, WEC Energy Group expects to use coal as a backup fuel only and believes it will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2035. 
 
 Creating a Sustainable Future 
 
 WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fired generation. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce CO 2 emissions from our electric generation. When taken together, the retirements and new investments in renewables and clean generation discussed in more detail below, should better balance our supply with our demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. 
 
 WEC Energy Group has already retired more than 1,800 MWs of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2018 retirement of the Pulliam power plant and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. Through the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, which includes the planned retirement by June 2026 of jointly-owned Columbia Units 1-2. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information. 
 
 See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Corporate Developments for more information on the ESG Progress Plan. 
 
 Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Legislation and Regulation - Our operations, capital expenditures, and financial results may be affected by the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals. 
 
 Renewable Generation 
 
 We meet a portion of our electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric. This helps us maintain compliance with renewable energy legislation. These renewable energy resources also help us maintain diversity in our generation portfolio, which effectively serves as a price hedge against future fuel costs, and will help mitigate the risk of potential unknown costs associated with any future carbon restrictions for electric generators. 
 
 Wind 
 
 In January 2022, we, along with an unaffiliated utility, received approval from the PSCW to acquire Red Barn, a utility-scale wind-powered electric generating facility. The project will be located in Grant County, Wisconsin and once constructed, we will own 82 MW of this project. Construction of the project is expected to be completed during the first half of 2023.

 In December 2022, we completed capital investments to repower major components of Crane Creek Wind Park, which qualifies for PTCs. 
 
 Solar and Battery Storage 
 
 As part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, in April 2021, we, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire the Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park. Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park is a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Dane County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 45 MW of solar generation and 25 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, construction of the solar portion is expected to be completed in 2025. 
 
 We have also received approvals from the PSCW to invest in 96 MW of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, including the following: 
 
 In December 2022, we, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, received approval from the PSCW to acquire and construct Darien, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Rock and Walworth counties, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 37 MW of solar generation and 12 MW of battery storage of this project. The construction of the solar portion is expected to be completed in 2024. 
 
 In January 2022, we, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Paris, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 30 MW of solar generation and 17 MW of battery storage of this project. The construction of the solar portion is expected to be completed in 2023. 
 
 Natural Gas-Fired Generation 
 
 We have filed applications with the PSCW for approval to invest in natural gas-fired generation. In January 2022, we, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire a portion of West Riverside's nameplate capacity. We are also requesting approval to assign the option to purchase part of West Riverside to WE. If approved, we or WE would acquire 100 MW of capacity, in the first of two potential option exercises. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant recently completed by an unaffiliated utility in Rock County, Wisconsin. If approved, the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we could exercise and request approval to assign to WE a second option to acquire an additional 100 MW of capacity. 
 
 We have received approval from the PSCW to invest in 182.3 MW of natural gas-fired generation, including the following: 
 
 In December 2022, we and WE received approval from the PSCW to acquire Whitewater, a commercially operational 236.5 MW dual fueled (natural gas and low sulfur fuel oil) combined cycle electrical generation facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Our share of the of capacity is 50 , or 118.3 MW. We added Whitewater to our generation portfolio when this transaction closed in January 2023. 
 
 In March 2022, we and WE received approval from the PSCW to construct a natural gas-fired generation facility at our existing Weston power plant site in northern Wisconsin. The new facility will consist of seven RICE units. Once fully constructed, we will own 64 MW of this project. Construction is expected to be completed in 2023. 
 
 Other Sustainability Programs 
 
 In August 2021, the PSCW approved a pilot program for us to install and maintain EV charging equipment for customers at their homes or businesses. The program provides direct benefits to customers by removing cost barriers associated with installing EV equipment. In October 2021, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, WEC Energy Group pledged to expand the EV charging network within the service territories of its electric utilities. In doing so, WEC Energy Group joined a coalition of utility companies in a unified effort to make EV charging convenient and widely available throughout the Midwest. The coalition WEC Energy Group joined is planning to help build and grow EV charging corridors, enabling the general public to safely and efficiently charge their vehicles.

 Electric System Reliability 
 
 The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5 reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 17.9 installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023. MISO is implementing seasonal requirements effective June 1, 2023. The installed capacity reserve margins for the planning year June 1, 2023 through May 31, 2024 are as follows: 15.9 summer (June August), 25.8 fall (September November), 41.2 winter (December February) and 39.3 spring (March May). MISO's short-term reserve margin requirements experience year-to-year and season-to-season fluctuations, primarily due to changes in the generation resource mix and average forced outage rate of generation within the MISO footprint. 
 
 We believe that we have adequate capacity through company-owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during the current planning year. We also fully anticipate that we will have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements for the upcoming planning year. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power Costs 
 
 Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW generally allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a 2 price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see D. Regulation. 
 
 Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type, including delivery costs, were as follows for the years ended December 31: 
 2022 2021 2020 Coal 26.68 23.00 23.10 Natural gas combined cycle 38.98 22.36 15.80 Natural gas/oil peaking units 77.80 69.07 32.33 Purchased power 60.19 49.42 34.09 
 
 We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services are exposed to volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and diesel fuel. To moderate this volatility risk, we have PSCW approval for a hedging program. This program allows us to hedge up to 75 of our potential risks related to rail transportation fuel surcharge exposure. The results of this hedging program, when used, are reflected in the average costs of fuel and purchased power. 
 
 We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. We also have PSCW approval for a hedging program to moderate volatility related to natural gas price risk. This program allows us to hedge up to 75 of our estimated natural gas use for electric generation. The results of this hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas. 
 
 Coal Supply 
 
 We diversify the coal supply for our jointly-owned electric generating facilities by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania, as well as from various other states. For 2023, 100 of our total projected coal requirements of 2.5 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.

 The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows: 
 (in thousands) Annual Tonnage 2023 2,513 2024 2,500 2025 1,620 
 
 Coal Deliveries 
 
 All of our coal requirements are expected to be shipped by unit trains that we own or lease under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities. For additional information concerning risks related to coal supply chain disruptions, see the risk factor below. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Economic and Market Volatility We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities. 
 
 Power Purchase Commitments 
 
 We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. Our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties consist of 100 MW per year for 2023 through 2027, which exclude planning capacity purchases. Through WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan, we retired some of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation in 2018. To procure additional planning capacity, we purchased capacity from the MISO annual auction to ensure that we maintain our compliance with planning reserve requirements as established by the PSCW and MISO. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. In 2022, our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, we did not require public appeals for conservation, and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. We did have economic interruption events; however, service to customers was not curtailed. Economic interruptions are declared during times in which the price of electricity in the regional market exceeds the cost of operating the company's peaking generation. During this time, interruptible customers can choose to continue using electricity at a price based on wholesale market prices or to reduce their load. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by customers and alternative energy sources. We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 
 
 For more information on competition in our service territory, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Competitive Markets. 

Natural Gas Utility Operations 
 
 We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. Our natural gas utility provides service to customers located in northeastern Wisconsin. 
 
 We provide service to residential and commercial and industrial customers. In addition, we offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Major industries served include paper, utilities, food products, governmental, and education. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

 For information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, see Note 4, Operating Revenues. 
 
 Natural Gas Sales Forecast 
 
 Our service territory experienced higher weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to strong growth in sales to retail customers and deliveries to transportation service customers. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow at an annual rate between 0.6 and 1.0 for the period 2025 through 2027, assuming normal weather.

 Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage 
 
 We manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts, storage services, and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies. 
 
 Pipeline Capacity and Storage 
 
 The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin access supply from natural gas producing areas in the Southern and Eastern United States, along with western Canada. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 
 
 Due to variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We have entered into a long-term service agreement for natural gas storage with a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluewater. Bluewater, a wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan and provides approximately one-third of our current storage needs. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 40 of forecasted demand for November through March. Diversity of natural gas supply enables us to manage significant changes in demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months. 
 
 We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts. 
 
 Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRM. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues. 
 
 Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our forecasted design peak-day throughput is 8.7 million therms for the 2022 through 2023 heating season. Our peak daily send-out during 2022 was 6.1 million therms on January 25, 2022.

On December 23, 2022, the Guardian pipeline, which provides natural gas to our distribution network, experienced a significant equipment failure, resulting in a significant reduction in the delivery of natural gas it had committed to provide. In addition, extreme cold weather in our service territory put additional strain on our ability to receive natural gas from other pipeline suppliers. As a result of these events, we reduced natural gas deliveries to our interruptible business customers. By reducing these deliveries, we were able to avoid any significant natural gas outages. 
 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 
 We have contracts with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in some of the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. 
 
 We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market. 
 
 Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices 
 
 We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60 of planned winter demand and up to 15 of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. This approval allows us to pass 100 of the hedging costs (premiums, brokerage fees and losses) and proceeds (gains) to customers through our GCRM. 
 
 To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward-market price differentials. That approval provides for 100 of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRM. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. 
 
 Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of our winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. Electrification initiatives or mandates are being considered or proposed by local and state governments. In addition, all of our customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. We offer natural gas transportation services for customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. We continue to earn distribution revenues from these transportation customers for their use of our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. 
 
 For more information on competition in our service territory, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Competitive Markets.

 Environmental Goals 
 
 WEC Energy Group also continues to reduce methane emissions by improving its natural gas distribution systems, and has set a target across its natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. WEC Energy Group plans to achieve its net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout its utility systems. In 2022, we received approval from the PSCW for an RNG pilot. We also signed our first two contracts for RNG for our natural gas distribution system, pursuant to which we will be transporting the output of local dairy farms onto our gas distribution system. The RNG supplied will directly replace higher-emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. We expect to have RNG flowing to our distribution system later in 2023, supporting our goal to reduce methane emissions. 

C. OTHER SEGMENT 
 
 Our other segment includes our non-utility activities as well as equity earnings from our investment in WRPC. We own 50 of the stock of WRPC. WRPC owns two hydroelectric plants, and we are entitled to 50 of the total capacity from its plants. 

D. REGULATION 
 
 In addition to the specific regulations noted below, we are also subject to various other regulations, which primarily consist of regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. 
 
 Rates 
 
 Our retail electric and natural gas rates are regulated by the PSCW, and the FERC regulates our wholesale electric rates. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The following table compares our utility operating revenues by regulatory jurisdiction for each of the three years ended December 31: 
 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Electric Wisconsin 1,189.0 90.2 1,074.8 91.0 1,009.6 88.8 FERC Wholesale 129.4 9.8 106.1 9.0 127.4 11.2 Total 1,318.4 100.0 1,180.9 100.0 1,137.0 100.0 Natural Gas Wisconsin 466.8 100.0 340.0 100.0 270.1 100.0 Total utility operating revenues 1,785.2 1,520.9 1,407.1 
 
 Retail Rates 
 
 The PSCW has general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in its jurisdiction including, but not limited to, approval of retail utility rates and standards of service, security issuances, mergers, affiliate transactions, location and construction of electric generating units and natural gas facilities, and certain other additions and extensions to utility facilities. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 11 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Historically, retail rates approved by the PSCW have been designed to provide utilities the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, along with a return on investment sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction. We are subject to an earnings sharing mechanism in which a portion of our earnings are required to be refunded to customers if we earn above our authorized ROE. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our earnings sharing mechanism. The table below reflects our approved ROE and capital structure during 2022. 
 Regulated Retail Rates Regulatory Commission Authorized ROE Average Common Equity Component Electric and natural gas (1) 
 PSCW 10.0 52.5 
 
 (1) In accordance with our most recent rate order, effective January 1, 2023, our base rates reflect a 9.80 authorized ROE and an average common equity component of 53.0 . See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information. 
 
 In addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, we have certain recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund prudently incurred costs that differ from those approved in base rates. 
 
 Embedded within our electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of our symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2 of our approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. Our deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If our ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which our return exceeds the authorized amount. 
 
 Our natural gas utility operates under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 
 
 See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information on the significant mechanisms we had in place during 2022 that allowed us to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. 
 
 We file periodic requests with the PSCW for changes in retail rates. Our rate requests are based on forward looking test years, which reflect additions to infrastructure and changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred. For information on our regulatory proceedings, see Note 23, Regulatory Environment. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at https://psc.wi.gov/. The material and information contained on this website are not intended to be a part of, nor are they incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Wholesale Rates 
 
 The FERC regulates our wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services. We have received market-based rate authority from the FERC. Market-based rate authority allows wholesale electric sales to be made in the MISO market and directly to third parties based on the negotiated market value of the transaction. We also make wholesale sales pursuant to cost-based formula rates. Cost-based formula rates provide for recovery of our costs and an approved rate of return. The predetermined formula is initially based on our expenses from the previous year, but is eventually trued up to reflect actual, current-year costs. 
 
 Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets 
 
 In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO operates bid-based energy markets. MISO is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the electric transmission system in its footprint. 
 
 In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 
 
 As part of MISO, a market-based platform is used for valuing transmission congestion premised upon an LMP system. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2022, 
 2022 Form 10-K 12 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 through May 31, 2023. The resulting ARR allocation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. 
 
 MISO has an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO footprint. To meet this requirement, capacity resources can be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. While the zone in which our load resides had sufficient generation capacity resources for the period between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023, the MISO North region as a whole did not have enough capacity to meet the planning reserve margin for the same time period. Due to the capacity shortage in the MISO North region, all of its zones cleared at the cost of new entry in the annual auction, which is the maximum clearing price. To date, there have been sufficient resources in real time operations to meet the demand obligations in the MISO North region. 
 
 MISO is implementing a seasonal resource adequacy requirement effective June 1, 2023. As part of this, the capacity accreditation methodology has changed for thermal resources. Currently, it is difficult to predict the MISO North region's capacity position for the upcoming planning year. It is possible that the capacity shortage in the MISO North region will continue as additional resources retire and new resources are delayed. Our strategy has always been to minimize the amount of capacity we procure from the auction to reduce our exposure to capacity shortages. This includes managing our generation portfolio, both retirements and new resources, to ensure we do not get in a significant short position. 
 
 Other Electric Regulations 
 
 We are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards. 
 
 We are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin which contains certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. 
 
 All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 
 
 Other Natural Gas Regulations 
 
 Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the PSCW are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline). 
 
 We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territory. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to our low-income customers. 
 
 Compliance Costs 
 
 The regulations and oversight described above significantly influence our operating environment, and may cause us to incur compliance and other related costs and may affect our ability to recover these costs from our utility customers. Any anticipated capital expenditures for compliance with government regulations for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements.

 E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 
 
 Our operations, especially as they relate to our coal-fired generating facilities, are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation related to GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, water use, or wastewater discharges and other climate change issues, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs. 
 
 Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements. For a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change, see Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies. 

F. HUMAN CAPITAL 
 
 We believe our employees are among our most important resources, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. We strive to foster a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace; attract, retain and develop talented personnel; and keep our employees safe and healthy. 
 
 WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors retains collective responsibility for comprehensive risk oversight of WEC Energy Group and its subsidiaries, including critical areas that could impact our sustainability, such as human capital. Management regularly reports to WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion, employee development, and safety and health. WEC Energy Group's Board of Directors delegates specified duties to its committees. In addition to its responsibilities relative to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing organizational matters that could significantly impact us, including succession planning. The Compensation Committee reviews recruiting and development programs and priorities, receives updates on key talent, and assesses workforce diversity across WEC Energy Group and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Workforce 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,136 employees, including 813 that are represented under union agreements. We believe we have very good overall relations with our workforce. In order to attract and retain talent, we provide competitive wages and benefits to our employees based on their performance, role, location, and market data. Our compensation package also includes a 401(k) savings plan with an employer match, an annual incentive plan based on meeting company goals, healthcare and insurance benefits, vacation and paid time off days, as well as other benefits. 
 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 
 We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace. Our commitment is a core strategic competency and an integral part of our culture. As of December 31, 2022, women and racial minorities represented approximately 15 and 3 , respectively, of our workforce. WEC Energy Group has a number of initiatives that promote diverse workforce contributions, educate employees about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and ensure its companies, including us, are attractive employers for persons of diverse backgrounds. These initiatives include nine business resource groups (voluntary, employee-led groups organized around a particular shared background or interest), mentoring programs, and training for leaders on countering unconscious bias, building inclusive teams, and preventing workplace harassment. We also support external leadership and educational programs that support, train, and promote women and minorities in the communities we serve. 
 
 Safety and Health 
 
 WEC Energy Group's Executive Safety Committee directs our safety and health strategy, works to ensure consistency across groups, and reinforces our ongoing safety commitment that we refer to as Target Zero. Under our Target Zero commitment, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus. We monitor and set goals for Occupational Safety and Health Administration lost-time incidents and days away, restricted or

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 We are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this report and other documents filed by us with the SEC from time to time, when making an investment decision. 
 
 Risks Related to Legislation and Regulation 
 
 Our business is significantly impacted by governmental regulation and oversight. 
 
 We are subject to significant state, local, and federal governmental regulations, including regulations by the PSCW and the FERC. These regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. Changes in regulations, interpretations of regulations, or the imposition of new regulations could also significantly impact us, including requiring us to change our business operations. Many aspects of our operations are regulated and impacted by government regulation, including, but not limited to: the rates we charge our retail electric and natural gas customers; our authorized rate of return; construction and operation of electric generating facilities and electric and natural gas distribution systems, including the ability to recover such costs; decommissioning generating facilities, the ability to recover the related costs, and continuing to recover the return on the net book value of these facilities; wholesale power service practices; electric reliability requirements and accounting; participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market; standards of service; issuance of securities; short-term debt obligations; transactions with affiliates; and billing practices. Failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to customer refunds, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The rates we are allowed to charge our customers for retail and wholesale services have the most significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Rate regulation provides us an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent upon regulatory action, and there is no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred. In addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide for a reasonable ROE. We defer certain costs and revenues as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery from or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is subject to review and approval by our regulators. If recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 
 We believe we have obtained the necessary permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses for our existing operations, have complied in all material respects with all of their associated terms, and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. These permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, discharge permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. Licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal, state, and local agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. We cannot predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies. 
 
 If we are unable to recover costs of complying with regulations or other associated costs in customer rates in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain, renew, or comply with these governmental permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, or licenses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 We face significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Our operations are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements related to, among other things, air emissions (including, but not limited to: CO 2, methane, mercury, SO 2 , and NOx), protection of natural resources, water quality, wastewater discharges, and management of hazardous and toxic substances and solid wastes and soils. For example, the EPA adopted and implemented (or is in the process of implementing) regulations governing the emission of NOx, ozone, fine particulates, and other air pollutants under the CAA through the NAAQS, climate change regulations, NSPS for GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fueled power plants, and other air quality regulations. The EPA also finalized regulations under the Clean Water Act that govern cooling water intake structures at our power plants, revised the 
 2022 Form 10-K 16 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants, and along with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, released a final rule revising the definition of WOTUS that may impact projects requiring federal permits. Several of these rules are being challenged or reviewed by agencies under the Biden Administration's Executive Order 13990, which creates additional uncertainty. As a result of these challenges and reviews, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted at the federal, state, or local level. 
 
 We incur significant capital and operating resources to comply with environmental laws, regulations, and requirements, including costs associated with the installation of pollution control equipment; operating restrictions on our facilities; and environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at our facilities. The operation of emission control equipment and compliance with rules regulating our intake and discharge of water could also increase our operating costs and reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. These regulations may create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability and/or cost of fossil fuels and our ability to continue operating certain generating units. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and requirements, even if caused by factors beyond our control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. We continue to assess the potential cost of complying, and to explore different alternatives in order to comply, with these and other environmental regulations. 
 
 As a result of these compliance costs and other factors, certain of our coal-fired electric generating facilities have become uneconomical to maintain and operate, which has resulted in these units being retired or converted to an alternative type of fuel. As part of WEC Energy Group's commitment to a cleaner energy future, we have already retired approximately 300 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018. Under the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, and plans to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities. We continue to evaluate the conversion of certain coal units to natural gas. 
 
 We are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts at certain of our current and former facilities and at third-party owned sites. We accrue liabilities and defer costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs include all costs incurred to date that we expect to recover, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation and related legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered (or that may be recovered) from insurance or other third parties. Due to the potential for the imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future, the possibility that other potentially responsible parties may not be willing or financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, a change in conditions or the discovery of additional contamination, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in the future may accelerate or could vary from the amounts currently accrued. 
 
 Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, occurs frequently throughout the United States. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by GHG and other emissions and exposure to regulated substances and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. In addition to claims relating to our current facilities, we may also be subject to potential liability in connection with the environmental condition of facilities that we previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during, or after the time we owned or operated these facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause (or caused) harm to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil penalties and damages against us. The incurrence of a material environmental liability or a material judgment in any action for personal injury or property damage related to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 In the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures and related costs from our customers in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, increased costs recovered through rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 
 Our operations, capital expenditures, and financial results may be affected by the impact of greenhouse gas legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals. 
 
 There is continued scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change. Management expects this attention to continue since climate change is one of President Biden's primary initiatives, with significant actions being taken by his administration with more expected to follow. As a result, we expect the EPA and states to adopt and implement additional regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs. There have also been increasing efforts to introduce and adopt electrification 
 2022 Form 10-K 17 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 initiatives and/or mandates and other efforts to reduce the use of natural gas. In addition, there is increasing activism from other stakeholders, including institutional investors and other sources of financing, to accelerate the transition to lower GHG emissions. 
 
 Costs associated with such legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant. GHG regulations that may be adopted in the future, at either the federal or state level, or other necessary changes to WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan, may cause our environmental compliance spending to differ materially from the amounts currently estimated. There is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover costs incurred to comply with these and other federal and state regulations or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise conditioned. These regulations, as well as changes in the fuel markets and advances in technology, could make additional electric generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate, may impact how we operate our existing fossil-fueled power plants, and could cause us to retire and replace units earlier than planned under the ESG Progress Plan, which could lead to a possible loss on abandonment and reduced revenues. 
 
 In addition, our natural gas delivery systems may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation, construction, and repair. Fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane. CO 2 is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption. Certain states outside our service territories have passed legislation banning natural gas used in new construction in order to limit these GHG emissions. Future local, statewide, or nationwide actions like these to regulate GHG emissions could increase the price of natural gas, restrict the use of natural gas, cause us to accelerate the replacement and/or updating of our natural gas delivery systems, and adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities. A significant increase in the price of natural gas may increase rates for our natural gas customers, which could reduce natural gas demand. 
 
 The adoption of electrification initiatives and/or mandates could result in a further reduction in natural gas demand and revenue, as well as an increase in electrical demand and increased investment costs for existing or new electrical systems. These types of initiatives and/or mandates could result in increased costs associated with permitting and siting of new technologies and delayed installation and start-up timelines. In addition, financial investments in older carbon intensive technologies may not be fully realized. 
 
 WEC Energy Group has set goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from its electric generation fleet by 60 by the end of 2025 and by 80 by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Over the longer term, the target for WEC Energy Group's generation fleet is net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. WEC Energy Group also believes it will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2035. 
 
 We continue to monitor the financial and operational feasibility of taking more aggressive action to further reduce GHG emissions in order to limit future global temperature increases. Through its ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group continues to reduce methane emissions by improving its natural gas distribution systems. WEC Energy Group set a target across its natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. 
 
 The ability to achieve these reductions in CO 2 and methane emissions depends on many external factors, including the ability to make operating refinements, the retirement of less efficient generating units, the development of relevant energy technologies, the use of RNG throughout our natural gas utility systems, and the ability to execute WEC Energy Group's capital plan. These efforts could impact how we operate our electric generating units and natural gas facilities and lead to increased competition and regulation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 
 
 Changes in tax legislation, IRS audits, or our inability to use certain tax benefits and carryforwards, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our credit ratings. 
 
 Tax legislation and regulations can adversely affect, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and credit ratings. Future changes to corporate tax rates or policies, including under Treasury Regulations and guidance issued in connection with the IRA, could require us to take material charges against earnings. Such changes include, among other things, increasing the federal corporate income tax rate, disallowing use of certain tax benefits and carryforwards, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. Our inability to manage these changes, an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions, or additional interpretations, implementing regulations, amendments, or technical corrections by the Treasury Department, the IRS, or state income tax authorities, could significantly impact our financial results and cash flows. 
 
 We have significantly reduced our federal and state income tax liabilities in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions. A reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. We have not fully used these allowed tax benefits in our previous tax filings and have carried them forward to use against

 future taxable income. Our inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully use these tax carryforwards before they expire, or to transfer future tax credits as discussed below, could significantly affect our tax obligations and financial results. 
 
 In addition, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in renewable energy generating facilities. These facilities generate PTCs or ITCs that we can use to reduce our federal tax obligations. The recently passed IRA may also allow us to transfer some of these future credits to third parties at a discounted value. We are still awaiting Treasury guidance on how and when we are allowed to transfer these credits. The amount of tax credits we earn depends on available government incentives and policies, the amount of electricity produced, the applicable tax credit rate, or the amount of the investment in qualifying property. In addition, a variety of operating and economic factors, including transmission constraints, adverse weather conditions, and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the PTCs generated by the renewable projects we have invested in, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, or other assessments related to renewable energy projects as well as any reductions or eliminations of tax credits or other governmental incentives that promote renewable energy generating facilities may limit our ability to make further investments in renewable energy generating facilities or reduce the returns on our existing investments. 
 
 We are also uncertain as to how credit rating agencies, capital markets, the FERC, or state public utility commissions will treat any future changes to federal or state tax legislation. These impacts could subject us to credit rating downgrades. In addition, certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted by changes in federal or state income tax legislation. 
 
 We could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. 
 
 We are subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject us to higher operating costs. If we are found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation. 
 
 Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business 
 
 Public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, could adversely affect our business functions, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 
 Public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, and any related government responses may adversely impact the economy and financial markets and could have a variety of adverse impacts on us, including a decrease in revenues; increased bad debt expense; increases in past due accounts receivable balances; and access to the capital markets at unreasonable terms or rates. 
 
 Public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, and any related government responses could also impair our ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities. Risks include extended disruptions to supply chains and inflation, resulting in increased costs for labor, materials, and services, which could adversely impact our ability to implement our corporate strategy. We may also be adversely impacted by labor disruptions and productivity as a result of infections, employee attrition, and a reduced ability to replace departing employees as a result of employees who leave or forego employment to avoid any required precautionary measures. 
 
 Despite our efforts to manage the impacts of public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, that may occur in the future, the extent to which they may affect us depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. As a result, we are unable to determine the potential impact any such public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, may have on our business plans and operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Our operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, renewable energy facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers. 
 
 Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generation, natural gas and electric distribution facilities, and renewable energy facilities. The operation of these facilities involves many risks, including operator error and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 19 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Potential breakdown or failure may occur due to severe weather (i.e., storms, tornadoes, floods, droughts, etc.); catastrophic events (i.e., fires, earthquakes, and explosions); public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics; significant changes in water levels in waterways; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; performance below expected levels; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; terrorist or other physical attacks; or cyber security intrusions. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses, including increased maintenance costs, and unanticipated capital expenditures. Because our electric generation and renewable energy facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. Unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues, cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. 
 
 Insurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Our natural gas operations depend upon the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas. 
 
 We purchase almost all of our natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to our natural gas systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of our core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or physical attacks, cyberattacks, other acts of war, or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby significantly disrupt our operations and/or reduce earnings. For example, in December 2022, the Guardian Pipeline experienced a significant equipment failure, which limited the amount of natural gas that it could send us. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, offshore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited. 
 
 Our operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in energy sales to customers, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service area, varying weather conditions, and energy conservation efforts. 
 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon: 
 
 Fluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service area. Customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as economic factors in our service territory, including workforce reductions, stagnant wage growth, changing levels of support from state and local government for economic development, business closings, and reductions in the level of business investment. We are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. Any economic downturn, disruption of financial markets, or reduced incentives by state government for economic development could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products or services. These risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. We could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills. 
 Weather conditions . Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months when cooling and heating is necessary. In addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. As a result, our overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, milder temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter heating season may result in lower revenues and net income. 
 Our customers' continued focus on energy conservation . Our customers' use of electricity and natural gas has decreased as a result of continued individual conservation efforts, including the use of more energy efficient technologies. Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income and increases in energy prices. Conservation of energy can be influenced by certain federal and state programs that are intended to influence how consumers use energy. For example, several states, including Wisconsin, have adopted energy efficiency targets to reduce energy consumption. 
 
 As part of our planning process, we estimate the impacts of changes in customer growth and general economic conditions, weather, and customer energy conservation efforts, but risks still remain. Any of these matters, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting 
 2022 Form 10-K 20 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 rates as a result of reduced sales from effective conservation measures or the adoption of new technologies, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our operations are subject to the effects of global climate change. 
 
 A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territory. 
 
 If climate changes occur that result in extreme temperatures in our service territory, our financial results could be adversely impacted by lower electric and natural gas usage and higher natural gas costs. An extreme weather event could result in downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment, which could result in us incurring significant restoration costs and foregoing sales of electricity and lost revenues. An extreme weather event could also cause the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas utility customers and for the use of fuel at our generation facilities to be temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal winter weather expectations. Although we have regulatory mechanisms in place for recovering all prudently incurred natural gas costs, regulatory commissions could disallow recovery or order the refund of any costs determined to be imprudent. 
 
 In addition, our operations could be adversely affected and our facilities placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, which could result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, such as wind storms, floods, tornadoes, snow and ice storms, or abnormal levels of precipitation. Extreme weather may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring us to procure additional power at wholesale prices for our retail operations, unpredictable curtailment of customer load by MISO to maintain grid reliability, or other grid reliability issues. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses including increased maintenance costs and unanticipated capital expenditures. The cost of storm restoration efforts may also not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. 
 
 Our corporate strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to lower GHG emissions. In addition, changes in policy to combat climate change, including mitigation and adaptation efforts, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to lower emissions, may materially adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows through significant capital expenditures and investments in renewable generation. 
 
 Our operations and future results may be impacted by changing expectations and demands of our customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders, including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns. 
 
 Our ability to execute WEC Energy Group's strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of affordability and reliability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers sustainability goals and energy needs, as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors, and other stakeholders may impact our reputation and affect our ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases or our results of operations. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. As it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation. 
 
 Our operations and corporate strategy may be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions and inflation. 
 
 Our business is dependent on the global supply chain to ensure that equipment, materials, and other resources are available to both expand and maintain services in a safe and reliable manner. Current domestic and global supply chain disruptions are delaying the delivery, and in some cases resulting in shortages of, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to our business operations. Failure to eliminate or manage the constraints in the supply chain may eventually impact the availability of items that are necessary to support normal operations as well as materials that are required to implement our corporate strategy for continued infrastructure growth, including our renewable energy projects. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 21

Table of Contents 

 Moreover, prices of equipment, materials, and other resources have increased recently as a result of these supply chain disruptions and may continue to increase in the future, as a result of inflation. Increases in inflation raise our costs for labor, materials, and services, and failure to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates to account for increased costs, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are actively involved with multiple significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects. 
 
 Our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We also expect to continue constructing and investing in renewable energy generating facilities as part of WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan, including repowering existing wind generation projects in our generation portfolio. 
 
 Achieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties, some of which we will have limited or no control over, that could adversely affect project costs and completion time. Supply chain disruptions, including solar panel shortages and increasing material costs as a result of government tariffs and other factors, could impact the timing of completion of our renewable projects. Additional risks include, but are not limited to, the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames; the availability of labor or materials at estimated costs; the ability of contractors to perform under their contracts; strikes; adverse weather conditions; potential legal challenges; changes in applicable laws or regulations; rising interest rates; the impact of public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics; other governmental actions; continued public and policymaker support for such projects; and events in the global economy. In addition, certain of these projects require the approval of the PSCW. If construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and/or projections on which the approval was based, our regulators may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and disallow recovery of them through rates, and otherwise available PTCs and ITCs for renewable energy projects could be lost or lose value. 
 
 To the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, tax credits are lost or lose value, or we (or third parties with whom we invest and/or partner) otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our (or their) capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cyber security intrusions, terrorist or other physical attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information. 
 
 We have been subject to attempted cyber attacks from time to time, and will likely continue to be subject to such attempted attacks; however, these prior attacks have not had a material impact on our system or business operations. Despite the implementation of security measures, all assets and systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to physical or cyber security intrusions caused by human error, vendor bugs, terrorist or other physical attacks (including potential attacks on our substations and other electric distribution equipment), acts of war, or other malicious acts. These threats could result in a full or partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. If our assets or systems were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached, and were not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions, and data, including sensitive information, could be compromised. 
 
 We operate in an industry that requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which control an interconnected system of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. A successful physical or cyber security intrusion may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take, which include compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards. Successful cyber security intrusions, including those targeting the electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. Attacks may come through ransomware, software updates or patches, or firmware that hackers can manipulate. These intrusions may cause unplanned outages at our power plants, which may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. The risk of such intrusions may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure. 
 
 Our continued efforts to integrate, consolidate, and streamline our operations have also resulted in increased reliance on current and recently completed projects for technology systems. We implement procedures to protect our systems, but we cannot guarantee that the procedures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and systems are

 adequate to safeguard against all security breaches. The failure of any of these or other similarly important technologies, or our inability to support, update, expand, and/or integrate these technologies with those of our affiliates could materially and adversely impact our operations, diminish customer confidence and our reputation, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation. 
 
 Our business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. Security breaches may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or could cause us to become subject to significant litigation, costs, liability, fines, or penalties, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations as well as our reputation with customers and regulators, among others. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with governmental actions in response to such intrusions or to strengthen our information and electronic control systems. We may also need to obtain additional insurance coverage related to the threat of such intrusions. 
 
 Threats to our systems and operations continue to emerge as new ways to compromise components into our systems or networks are developed. Any operational disruption or environmental repercussions caused by on-going or future threats to our assets and technology systems could result in a significant decrease in our revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The costs of repairing damage to our facilities, operational disruptions, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may also not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance. 
 
 Advances in technology, and legislation or regulations supporting such technology, could make our electric generating facilities less competitive and may impact the demand for natural gas. 
 
 Advances in new technologies that produce or store power or reduce power consumption are ongoing and include renewable energy technologies, customer-oriented generation, energy storage devices, and energy efficiency technologies. We generate power at central station power plants and utility-scale renewable generation facilities to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. Distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, solar cells, and related energy storage devices, have technologically improved and have become more cost competitive than they were in the past. Recently, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding that a third-party financed DER is not a public utility under Wisconsin law. A second petition is also being considered. Although the finding in the first petition was limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the lease presented in that petition, similar findings or a broader policy position could adversely impact our business operations. 
 
 Recently enacted legislation, including the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, promotes the construction and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy generation, including distributed generation technologies, for self-supply of electricity by our customers and third parties. This legislation also incentivizes modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid's capacity to interconnect to these distributed generation technologies. Other legislation or regulations could be adopted supporting the use of these technologies at below cost or that permit third-party sales from such facilities, and allow these facilities to interconnect to our distribution system. There is also a risk that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station and utility-scale renewable power production. 
 
 We cannot predict the effect that development of alternative energy sources or new technology may have on our natural gas operations, including whether subsidies of alternative energy sources by local, state, and federal governments might be expanded, or what impact this might have on the supply of or the demand for natural gas. 
 
 If these technologies become more cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, our market share could be eroded, and the value of our generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems could be reduced. Advances in technology, or changes in legislation or regulations, could also change the channels through which our customers purchase or use power and natural gas, which could reduce our sales and revenues or increase our expenses.

 We transport and distribute natural gas, which involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. 
 
 Inherent in natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, and mechanical problems, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of natural gas pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and/or administrative proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, or be resolved on unfavorable terms. 
 
 We may fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce. 
 
 We operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Failure to hire and obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Our counterparties may fail to meet their obligations, including obligations under power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, and transportation agreements. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform or if capacity is inadequate, we may be required to replace the underlying commitment at current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers' electric and natural gas requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. In such event, we may incur losses, and our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 
 We have entered into several power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, and transportation agreements with non-affiliated companies. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the counterparties of their obligations under these agreements. Although we have a comprehensive credit evaluation process and contractual protections, it is possible that one or more counterparties could fail to perform their obligations. If this were to occur, we generally would expect that any operating and other costs that were initially allocated to a defaulting customer's power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, or transportation agreement would be reallocated among our retail customers. To the extent these costs are not allowed to be reallocated by our regulators or there is any regulatory delay in adjusting rates, a counterparty default under these agreements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Economic and Market Volatility 
 
 Our business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets on competitive terms and rates. 
 
 We rely on access to credit and capital markets to support our capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. In addition, we rely on a committed bank credit agreement as back-up liquidity, which allows us to access the low cost commercial paper markets. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. Interest rates may increase in the future, which may affect our results of operations and our ability to earn our approved rate of return. Rising interest rates may also impair our ability to cost-effectively finance capital expenditures and to refinance maturing debt. 
 
 Our access to the credit and capital markets could be limited, or our cost of capital significantly increased, due to any of the following risks and uncertainties: 
 
 A rating downgrade; 
 2022 Form 10-K 24 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Failure to comply with debt covenants; 
 An economic downturn or uncertainty; 
 Prevailing market conditions and rules; 
 Concerns over foreign economic conditions; 
 Changes in tax policy; 
 Changes in investment criteria of institutional investors or banks, including any policies that would limit or restrict funding for companies with fossil fuel-related investments; 
 War or the threat of war; 
 The overall health and view of the utility and financial institution industries; and 
 The replacement of LIBOR with SOFR or other alternative reference rate. 
 
 LIBOR is the subject of national, international, and other regulatory reform, which is expected to cause LIBOR to cease to exist after June 2023. Various alternative reference rates are being evaluated by market participants, with SOFR being the most widely adopted alternative to date. Although we cannot predict the consequences of transitioning to SOFR or other alternative reference rate, they could include an increase in our interest expense. 
 
 If any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 
 A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or require the posting of collateral. 
 
 There are a number of factors that impact our credit ratings, including, but not limited to, capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other requirements for capital. We could experience a downgrade in ratings if the rating agencies determine that our level of business or financial risk, or that of the utility industry, has deteriorated. Changes in rating methodologies by the rating agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. 
 
 Any downgrade by the rating agencies could: 
 
 Increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facility; 
 Require the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the pool of creditors; 
 Decrease funding sources by limiting our access to the commercial paper market; 
 Limit the availability of adequate credit support for our operations; and 
 Trigger collateral requirements in various contracts. 
 
 Fluctuating commodity prices could negatively impact our electric and natural gas utility operations. 
 
 Our operating and liquidity requirements are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services. 
 
 We burn natural gas in several of our electric generation plants, and as a supplemental fuel at one of our coal-fired plants. In many instances the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. The cost of natural gas has increased, and may continue to increase because of disruptions in the supply of natural gas due to a curtailment in production or distribution, international market conditions, the demand for natural gas, and the availability of shale gas and potential regulations and/or other government action affecting its accessibility. 
 
 For Wisconsin retail electric customers, we bear the risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs within a symmetrical 2 fuel tolerance band compared to the forecast of fuel and purchased power costs established in our rate structure. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our wholesale electric customers. We receive dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs from our natural gas customers. 
 
 Changes in commodity prices could result in: 
 
 Higher working capital requirements, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings; 
 2022 Form 10-K 25 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Reduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, increased bad debt, and higher interest expense are not recovered through rates; 
 Higher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position; 
 Reduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses; and 
 Shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities. 
 
 We operate jointly-owned coal-fired electric generating units. Although we generally carry sufficient coal inventory at our generating facilities to protect against an interruption or decline in supply, there can be no assurance that the inventory levels will be adequate. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us or that we will be able to take delivery of all the coal volume contracted for. Coal deliveries may occasionally be restricted because of rail congestion and maintenance, derailments, weather, public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, and supplier financial hardship. Supplier financial hardship is a result of decreased demand for coal due to increased natural gas and renewable energy generation, the impact of environmental regulations, and environmental concerns related to coal-fired generation. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or we may be forced to reduce generation at our jointly-owned coal-fired units, which could lead to increased fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs could result in either reduced margins on net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, a reduction in the volume of net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, and/or an increase in net power purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. There is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates or that recovery would not otherwise be delayed, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Our use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses. 
 
 We use derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity price exposure. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, although our hedging programs must be approved by the PSCW, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. Changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. 
 
 Restructuring in the regulated energy industry and competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a negative impact on our business and revenues. 
 
 The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Deregulation or other changes in law in the states where we serve our customers could allow third-party suppliers to contract directly with customers for their natural gas and electric supply requirements. In addition, legislation or regulation that supports distributed energy technologies or that allows third party sales from such technologies could result in further competition. This increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a material adverse financial impact on us. 
 
 The FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market within these RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO implemented bid-based energy markets that are part of the MISO Energy Markets. All market participants, including us, must submit day-ahead and/or real time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes an LMP that reflects the market price for energy. We are required to follow MISO's instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISO's responsibility for maintaining the stability of the transmission system. MISO also implemented an ancillary services market for operating reserves that schedules energy and ancillary services at the same time as part of the energy market, allowing for more efficient use of generation assets in the MISO Energy Markets. These market designs continue to have the potential to increase the costs of transmission, the costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, the costs of participation in the MISO Energy Markets, and the costs associated with estimated payment settlements. 
 
 The FERC rules related to transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale electricity markets among regulated utilities, non-utility generators, wholesale power marketers, and brokers by providing greater flexibility and more choices to 
 2022 Form 10-K 26

Table of Contents 

 wholesale customers, including initiatives designed to encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply. In addition, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations impact hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges, as well as over-the-counter. Technology changes in the power and fuel industries also have significant impacts on wholesale transactions and related costs. We currently cannot predict the impact of these and other developments or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are driven by factors beyond our control. 
 
 Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, changes in assumptions, market conditions, and other factors may impact the performance of our benefit plan holdings. 
 
 We have significant obligations related to pension and OPEB plans. If WEC Energy Group is unable to successfully manage our benefit plan assets and medical costs, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our cost of providing these plans is dependent upon a number of factors, including actual plan experience, changes made to the plans, and assumptions concerning the future. Types of assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and our required or voluntary contributions to the plans. Plan assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield returns that fall below projected return rates. In addition, medical costs for both active and retired employees may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Our funding requirements could be impacted by a decline in the market value of plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in demographics (including the number of retirements), or changes in life expectancy assumptions. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 We may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses. 
 
 Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers and our contractors that are required to acquire and maintain insurance for our benefit. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us. In addition, our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Introduction 
 
 We are an electric and natural gas utility and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We derive revenues primarily from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin. We also provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale. We conduct our business primarily through our utility reportable segment. See Note 20, Segment Information, for more information on our reportable business segments. 
 
 Corporate Strategy 
 
 Our goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our customers and WEC Energy Group's shareholders by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. WEC Energy Group's capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as its ESG Progress Plan, provides a roadmap to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow WEC Energy Group's and our investment in the future of energy. 
 
 Throughout its strategic planning process, WEC Energy Group takes into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and affordability, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability. WEC Energy Group published the results of a priority sustainability issue assessment in 2020, identifying the issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders over the short and long terms. This risk and priority assessment has formed WEC Energy Group's direction as a company. 
 
 Creating a Sustainable Future 
 
 WEC Energy Group's ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fired generation at its electric utilities, including us. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance supply with demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting WEC Energy Group's and our goals to reduce CO 2 emissions from electric generation. 
 
 In May 2021, WEC Energy Group announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from its electric generation fleet by 60 by the end of 2025 and by 80 by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. WEC Energy Group expects to achieve these goals by making operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units and executing its capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for its generation fleet is net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. 
 
 As part of our path toward these goals, by the end of 2030, WEC Energy Group expects to use coal as a backup fuel only, and WEC Energy Group believes it will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2035. 
 
 WEC Energy Group already has retired more than 1,800 MWs of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2018 retirement of the Pulliam power plant as well as the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. Through the ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, which includes the planned retirement in 2026 of the jointly-owned Columbia Units 1-2. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information related to the planned Columbia retirements. 
 
 In addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, WEC Energy Group expects to invest approximately 5.4 billion from 2023-2027 in regulated renewable energy in Wisconsin. WEC Energy Group's plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following new investments made by either us or WE based on specific customer needs: 
 
 1,900 MW of utility-scale solar; 
 700 MW of battery storage; and 
 700 MW of wind. 
 2022 Form 10-K 30

Table of Contents 

WEC Energy Group also plans on investing in a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation, made by either us or WE based on specific customer needs, including: 
 
 100 MW of RICE natural gas-fueled generation; and 
 the planned purchase of 200 MW of capacity in West Riverside a combined cycle natural gas plant completed by Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.

 In August 2021, the PSCW approved pilot programs for us to install and maintain EV charging equipment for customers at their homes or businesses. The programs provide direct benefits to customers by removing cost barriers associated with installing EV equipment. In October 2021, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, WEC Energy Group pledged to expand the EV charging network within its utilities' electric service territories. In doing so, WEC Energy Group joined a coalition of utility companies in a unified effort to make EV charging convenient and widely available throughout the Midwest. The coalition WEC Energy Group joined is planning to help build and grow EV charging corridors, enabling the general public to safely and efficiently charge their vehicles. 
 
 WEC Energy Group also continues to reduce methane emissions by improving its natural gas distribution system, and has set a target across its natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. WEC Energy Group plans to achieve its net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout its utility systems. In 2022, we received approval from the PSCW for an RNG pilot and we signed our first two contracts for RNG for our natural gas distribution system, pursuant to which we will be transporting the output of local dairy farms onto our gas distribution system. The RNG supplied will directly replace higher-emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. We expect to have RNG flowing to our distribution network in 2023, supporting our goal to reduce methane emissions. 
 
 Reliability 
 
 We have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with the ESG Progress Plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution networks to further improve reliability. 
 
 For more details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Significant Capital Projects. 
 
 Operating Efficiency 
 
 We continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company and will continue to do so under the ESG Progress Plan. For example, we are making progress on our AMI program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between us and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities. 
 
 WEC Energy Group continues to focus on integrating the resources of its businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes. 
 
 Financial Discipline 
 
 A strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and quality credit ratings. 
 
 We follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, and equipment, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on our recent and planned acquisitions.

 Exceptional Customer Care 
 
 Our approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers expectations. 
 
 A multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across all of the WEC Energy Group companies. It has moved all utilities, including us, to a common platform for all customer-facing self-service options. Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers. 
 
 Safety 
 
 Safety is one of our core values and a critical component of our culture. We are committed to keeping our employees and the public safe through a comprehensive corporate safety program that focuses on employee engagement and elimination of at-risk behaviors. 
 
 Under our "Target Zero" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. Management and union leadership work together to reinforce the Target Zero culture. We set annual goals for safety results as well as measurable leading indicators, in order to raise awareness of at-risk behaviors and situations and guide injury-prevention activities. All employees are encouraged to report unsafe conditions or incidents that could have led to an injury. Injuries and tasks with high levels of risk are assessed, and findings and best practices are shared across the WEC Energy Group companies. 
 
 Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021. For a similar discussion that compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations in Part II of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. 

Earnings 
 
 Our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 235.0 million, compared with 231.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See below for additional information on the 3.9 million increase in earnings. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The discussion below addresses the contribution of our utility segment to net income. The discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margins (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margins (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes. 
 
 We believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our utility segment as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance. 
 
 Our electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Our utility segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was

 (1) Represents transmission expense that we are authorized to collect in rates. The PSCW has approved escrow accounting for ATC and MISO network transmission expenses. As a result, we defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. During 2022 and 2021, 155.0 million and 147.3 million, respectively, of costs were billed to us by transmission providers. 
 
 During 2022, we amortized 19.0 million of the regulatory liability associated with our transmission escrow to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies, as approved by the PSCW in order to forego filing for 2022 base rate increases. This amortization drove the decrease in transmission expense during 2022, compared with 2021. 
 
 (2) Regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on net income. 
 
 (3) Represents operation and maintenance associated with the earnings sharing mechanism we have in place. In 2022, the 21.6 million of amortization related to a certain portion of our regulatory liability associated with our 2020 earnings sharing mechanism to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies, as approved by the PSCW in order to forego filing for a 2022 base rate increase. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information about our earnings sharing mechanism.

 Electric Revenues 
 
 Electric revenues increased 137.5 million during 2022, compared with 2021. To the extent that changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. See the discussion of electric utility margins below for more information related to recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the remaining drivers of the changes in electric revenues. 
 
 Electric Utility Margins 
 
 Electric utility margins increased 9.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the higher electric utility margins were: 
 
 A 38.7 million increase in margins related to the impact of unprotected excess deferred taxes during 2021, which we agreed to return to customers in our PSCW-approved rate order. This increase in margins is offset in income taxes. See Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information. 
 
 A 3.6 million net increase in margins related to higher retail sales volumes, driven by the impact of favorable weather during 2022, compared with 2021. As measured by cooling degree days, the 2022 cooling season was 11.7 warmer than 2021. As measured by heating degree days, the 2022 heating season was 9.7 colder than 2021. 
 
 These increases in margins were partially offset by a 33.7 million year-over-year negative impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs collected in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, our margins are impacted by under- 
 2022 Form 10-K 34 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are within a 2 price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance beyond the 2 price variance is generally deferred for future recovery or refund to customers. As a result of the higher fuel costs in both 2021 and 2022, we were unable to defer a portion of our under-collected fuel and purchased power costs due to earning an ROE in excess of the PSCW authorized amount. 
 
 Natural Gas Revenues 
 
 Natural gas revenues increased 126.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021. Because prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed through to our customers in current rates, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. The average per-unit cost of natural gas increased approximately 34 during 2022, compared with 2021. The remaining drivers of changes in natural gas revenues are described in the discussion of natural gas utility margins below. 
 
 Natural Gas Utility Margins 
 
 Natural gas utility margins increased 7.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was an increase from higher sales volumes, driven by the continued economic recovery in Wisconsin from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as colder weather during the 2022 heating season, compared with 2021. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes) 
 
 Other operating expenses at the utility segment decreased 30.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the decrease in other operating expenses were: 
 
 A 25.8 million decrease in expense related to our earnings sharing mechanism, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our rate orders. 
 
 An 18.7 million decrease in transmission expense driven by the amortization of a certain portion of our regulatory liability associated with our transmission escrow balance, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. 
 
 An 8.7 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense due to increases to certain regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2022 Wisconsin rate orders. 
 
 These decreases in other operating expenses were partially offset by: 
 
 An 11.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan. 
 
 A 10.3 million increase in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, primarily driven by higher costs to manage system reliability, for storm restoration, and for overall maintenance of our distribution system during 2022. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net increased 4.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 19, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs. This increase was partially offset by lower AFUDC Equity, driven by Badger Hollow I being placed in service in November 2021. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased 5.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by higher interest rates on short-term debt and a long-term debt issuance in November 2021. Also contributing to the increase was AFUDC Debt recorded on capital projects, primarily related to Badger Hollow I being placed in service in November 2021. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 35 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense increased 41.0 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 39 million negative impact related to the lower year-over-year amortization of the unprotected excess deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation in connection with the rate order approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. The impact due to the benefit from the amortization of these unprotected excess deferred tax benefits in 2021 did not impact earnings as there was an offsetting impact in operating income. See Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 We expect to maintain adequate liquidity to meet our cash requirements for operation of our business and implementation of our corporate strategy through internal generation of cash from operations and access to the capital markets. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources includes comparisons of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021. For a similar discussion that compares our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31: 
 (in millions) 2022 2021 Change in 2022 Over 2021 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 288.2 438.3 (150.1) Investing activities (419.0) (397.7) (21.3) Financing activities 166.9 (40.9) 207.8 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 150.1 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by: 
 
 A 148.3 million decrease in cash from higher payments for fuel and purchased power at our plants during 2022, compared with 2021. Our plants incurred higher fuel costs during 2022 as a result of an increase in the price of natural gas. 
 
 An 81.1 million decrease in cash related to 25.9 million of cash paid for income taxes during 2022, compared with 55.2 million of cash received for income taxes during 2021. The higher cash paid for income taxes was driven by the monetization of fewer tax credits and higher taxable income during 2022. 
 
 A 10.1 million decrease in cash due to lower collateral received from counterparties during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by the execution of natural gas contracts at higher prices in 2022. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 36 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 These decreases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by: 
 
 A 64.9 million increase in cash from higher overall collections from customers as a result of an increase in natural gas sales volumes during 2022, compared with 2021. This increase was driven by the continued economic recovery in Wisconsin from the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable weather. 
 
 A 32.8 million increase in cash related to lower payments for other operation and maintenance expenses, driven by the timing of payments for accounts payable. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 21.3 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by a 44.1 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2022, which is discussed in more detail below. 
 
 This increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by: 
 
 Proceeds of 10.0 million received for reimbursement of ATC's construction costs during 2022. There were no proceeds received for reimbursement during 2021. 
 
 Proceeds of 4.4 million received for the cash surrender of life insurance during 2022. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 
 (in millions) 2022 2021 Change in 2022 Over 2021 Capital expenditures 433.8 389.7 44.1 
 
 The increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2022, compared with 2021, was driven by higher payments for capital expenditures related to Paris and other renewable energy projects, as well as the new natural gas-fired generation being constructed at our existing Weston power plant site. These increases were partially offset by lower payments for capital expenditures related to upgrades to our natural gas distribution system. 
 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Significant Capital Projects below for more information. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash related to financing activities increased 207.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by: 
 
 A 400.0 million increase in cash due to the repayment of long-term debt during 2021. There were no repayments of long-term debt during 2022. 
 
 A 140.0 million increase in cash related to lower dividends paid to our parent during 2022, compared with 2021, to balance our capital structure. 
 
 A 70.0 million increase in cash related to higher equity contributions received from our parent during 2022, compared with 2021, to balance our capital structure. 
 
 These increases in cash were partially offset by: 
 
 A 256.6 million decrease in cash due to 136.1 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2022, compared with 120.5 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2021. 
 
 A 150.0 million decrease in cash due to lower issuances of long-term debt during 2022, compared with the same period in 2021.

Cash Requirements 
 
 We require funds to support and grow our business. Our significant cash requirements primarily consist of capital and investment expenditures, payments to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, the payment of common stock dividends to our parent, and the funding of our ongoing operations. Our significant cash requirements are discussed in further detail below. 

Significant Capital Projects 
 
 We have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and interest rates. Our estimated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the next three years are reflected below. These amounts include anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues.

 We continue to upgrade our electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include addressing our aging infrastructure and system hardening and the AMI program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers. 
 
 WEC Energy Group is committed to investing in solar, wind, battery storage, and clean natural gas-fired generation. Below are examples of projects that are proposed or currently underway. 
 
 We, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Paris, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 30 MW of solar generation and 17 MW of battery storage of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately 65 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2023. 
 
 We, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Darien, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Rock and Walworth counties, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 37 MW of solar generation and 12 MW of battery storage of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately 65 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2024. 
 
 We, along with an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire Red Barn, a utility-scale wind-powered electric generating facility. The project will be located in Grant County, Wisconsin and once constructed, we will own 82 MW of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately 160 million, with construction expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. 
 
 In April 2021, we, along with WE and an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire the Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Dane County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, we will own 45 MW of solar generation and 25 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately 97 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2025.

 We, along with WE, received PSCW approval to construct a natural gas-fired generation facility at our existing Weston power plant site in northern Wisconsin. The new facility will consist of seven RICE units. Once constructed, we will own 64 MW of this project. Our share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately 85 million, with construction expected to be completed in 2023. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2023, we, along with WE, completed the acquisition of Whitewater, a commercially operational 236.5 MW dual fueled (natural gas and low sulfur fuel oil) combined cycle electrical generation facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Our share of the cost of this facility was approximately 37.5 million for 50 of the capacity, which includes transaction costs and working capital. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information. 
 
 In January 2022, we, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire a portion of West Riverside's nameplate capacity. We are also requesting approval to assign the option to purchase part of West Riverside to WE. If approved, we or WE would acquire 100 MW of capacity, in the first of two potential option exercises. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant recently completed by an unaffiliated utility in Rock County, Wisconsin. If approved, and we do not assign the option to WE, our share of the cost of this ownership interest would be approximately 91 million, with the transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we could exercise and request approval to assign to WE a second option to acquire an additional 100 MW of capacity. If approved, and we do not assign the option to WE, our share of the cost of this ownership interest is expected to be approximately 90 million, with the transaction expected to close in 2024. 
 
 In March 2022, the DOC opened an investigation into whether new tariffs should be imposed on solar panels and cells imported from multiple southeast Asian countries. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters United States Department of Commerce Complaints and Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act for information on the potential impacts to our solar projects as a result of the DOC investigation and CBP actions related to solar panels, respectively. The expected in-service dates identified above already reflect some of these impacts. 

Long-Term Debt 
 
 A significant amount of cash is required to retire and pay interest on our long-term debt obligations. See Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information on our outstanding long-term debt, including a schedule of our long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The following table summarizes our required interest payments on long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) as of December 31, 2022: 
 Interest Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Interest payments on long-term debt 1,482.4 81.1 161.0 130.2 1,110.1 

Common Stock Dividends 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid common stock dividends of 120.0 million, 260.0 million, and 260.0 million, respectively, to the sole holder of our common stock, Integrys. Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by our Board of Directors and is dependent upon future earnings, capital requirements, and financial and other business conditions. In addition, various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on our ability to transfer funds to Integrys in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. We do not believe that these restrictions will materially affect our operations or limit any dividend payments in the foreseeable future. See Note 11, Common Equity for more information related to these restrictions and our other common stock matters. 

Other Significant Cash Requirements 
 
 Our utility operations have purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, and gas supply, as well as the related storage and transportation. These costs are a significant component of funding our ongoing operations. See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information, including our minimum future commitments related to these purchase obligations.

Table of Contents 

 In addition to our energy-related purchase obligations, we have commitments for other costs incurred in the normal course of business, including costs related to information technology services, meter reading services, maintenance and other service agreements for certain generating facilities, and various engineering agreements. Our estimated future cash requirements related to these purchase obligations are reflected below. 
 Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Purchase orders 20.9 10.0 6.4 4.5 
 
 We have various finance and operating lease obligations. Our finance lease obligations primarily relate to land leases for our solar projects. See Note 15, Leases, for more information, including an analysis of our minimum lease payments due in future years. 
 
 We make contributions to our pension and OPEB plans based upon various factors affecting us, including our liquidity position and tax law changes. See Note 19, Employee Benefits, for our expected contributions in 2023 and our expected pension and OPEB payments for the next 10 years. We expect the majority of these future pension and OPEB payments to be paid from our outside trusts. See Sources of Cash Investments in Outside Trusts below for more information. 
 
 In addition to the above, our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 included various other liabilities that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the amount and timing of future payments cannot be determined with certainty. These liabilities include AROs, liabilities for the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites, and liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes. For additional information on these liabilities, see Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16, Income Taxes, respectively. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 1(q), Guarantees, and Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for more information.

 We anticipate meeting our short-term and long-term cash requirements to operate our business and implement our corporate strategy through internal generation of cash from operations, equity contributions from our parent, and access to the capital markets, which allows us to obtain external short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and intermediate or long-term debt securities. Cash generated from operations is primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas to our utility customers, reduced by costs of operations. Our access to the capital markets is critical to our overall strategic plan and allows us to supplement cash flows from operations with external borrowings to manage seasonal variations, working capital needs, commodity price fluctuations, unplanned expenses, and unanticipated events. 
 
 We maintain a bank back-up credit facility, which provides liquidity support for our obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. 
 
 The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and our cash requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals, and other factors. We plan to maintain a capital structure consistent with that approved by the PSCW. For more information on our approved capital structure, see Item 1. Business D. Regulation. 
 
 The issuance of our securities is subject to the approval of the PSCW. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, we file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities 
 2022 Form 10-K 40

Table of Contents 

 authorized by the PSCW, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets. 
 
 Although not the case as of December 31, 2022, our current liabilities sometimes exceed our current assets. If this were to occur, we do not expect this would have any impact on our liquidity as we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our available capacity of 203.8 million under our existing revolving credit facility, cash generated from ongoing operations, and access to the capital markets would be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements. 
 
 See Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our credit facility and securities. 

Investments in Outside Trusts 
 
 We maintain investments in outside trusts to fund the obligation to provide pension and certain OPEB benefits to current and future retirees. As of December 31, 2022, these trusts had investments of approximately 0.9 billion, consisting of fixed income and equity securities, that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. The performance of existing plan assets, long-term discount rates, changes in assumptions, and other factors could affect our future contributions to the plans, our financial position if our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, and future results of operations related to changes in pension and OPEB expense and the assumed rate of return. For additional information, see Note 19, Employee Benefits. 

Debt Covenants 
 
 Certain of our short-term debt agreements contain financial covenants that we must satisfy, including debt to capitalization ratios. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, Note 14, Long-Term Debt, and Note 11, Common Equity, for more information. 

Credit Rating Risk 
 
 Cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts, and cash collateral posted by external parties were immaterial as of December 31, 2022. From time to time, we may enter into commodity contracts that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S P Global Ratings, a division of S P Global Inc., and/or Baa3 at Moody s Investors Service, Inc. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties . 
 
 In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets. 
 
 Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency. 

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Competitive Markets 
 
 Electric Utility Industry 
 
 The FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 41 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. It is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin. 
 
 Natural Gas Utility Industry 
 
 We offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. 
 
 Due to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin non-residential customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a third-party supplier or us. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. 
 
 We offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is substantially offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. 
 
 We are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position. 

Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters 

Regulatory Recovery 
 
 We account for our regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by the PSCW and the FERC. See Item 1. Business D. Regulation for more information on these commissions. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for additional information regarding recent rate proceedings and orders. 
 
 Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to generic and/or specific orders issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by our regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities. 

Petitions Before PSCW Regarding Third-Party Financed Distributed Energy Resources 
 
 In May 2022, two petitions were filed with the PSCW requesting a declaratory ruling that the owner of a third-party financed DER is not a "public utility" as defined under Wisconsin law and, therefore, is not subject to the PSCW s jurisdiction under any statute or rule regulating public utilities. The parties that filed the petitions provide financing to their customers for installation of DERs (including solar panels and energy storage) on the customer s property. A DER is connected to the host customer s utility meter and is used for the customer s energy needs. It may also be connected to the grid for distribution. 
 
 In July 2022, the PSCW found that the specific facts and circumstances merited the opening of a docket for each petition to consider whether to grant all or part of the requested declaratory ruling. 
 
 On December 1, 2022, the PSCW granted one petitioner s request for a declaratory ruling, finding that the owner of the third-party financed DER at issue in the petitioner s brief is not a public utility under Wisconsin law. The ruling was limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the lease presented in that petition. A second petition is also being considered. Although the finding in the first 
 2022 Form 10-K 42 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 petition was limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the lease presented in that petition, similar findings or a broader policy position could adversely impact our business operations. 

Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act 
 
 The CBP issued a WRO in June 2021, applicable to certain silica-based products originating from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (Xinjiang), such as polysilicon, included in the manufacturing of solar panels. In June 2022, the WRO was superseded by the implementation of the UFLPA, which was signed into law by President Biden in December 2021. The UFLPA establishes a rebuttable presumption that any imports wholly or partially manufactured in Xinjiang are prohibited from entering the United States. While our suppliers were able to provide the CBP sufficient documentation to meet WRO compliance requirements, and we expect the same will be true for UFLPA purposes, we cannot currently predict what, if any, impact the UFLPA will have on the overall supply of solar panels into the United States and the related timing and cost of our solar projects included in WEC Energy Group's capital plan. 

United States Department of Commerce Complaints 
 
 In August 2021, a group of anonymous domestic solar manufacturers filed a petition (AD/CVD) with the DOC seeking to impose new tariffs on solar panels and cells imported from several countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. The petitioners claimed that Chinese solar manufacturers are shifting products to these countries to avoid the tariffs required on products imported from China. In November 2021, the DOC rejected this petition. In denying the petition, the DOC cited the anonymous group s refusal of the DOC s request to provide more detail and identify its members due to the members' concerns about retribution from the dominant Chinese solar industry. 
 
 In February 2022, a California based company filed a petition (AD/CVD) with the DOC seeking to impose new tariffs on solar panels and cells imported from multiple countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. While the petition is similar to the one rejected by the DOC in November 2021, there are notable differences. The group added Cambodia to the petition and requested that the DOC conduct a country-wide inquiry into each of the four countries. In March 2022, the DOC decided to act on the February petition and investigate the claim. On December 2, 2022, the DOC announced its preliminary determination that certain companies are circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and modules from China. As the next step, the DOC will conduct in-person audits to verify the information that was the basis of the finding. If the DOC makes a final determination, which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2023, that such circumvention is occurring it would be able to apply any final tariffs retroactively to November 4, 2021. If imposed, the new tariffs could further disrupt the supply of solar modules to the United States, and could impact the cost and timing of our solar projects. 
 
 In June 2022, the Biden Administration used its executive powers to issue a 24-month tariff moratorium on solar panels manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The moratorium comes as a direct response to concerns raised about the adverse impact from the ongoing DOC complaint on the U.S. solar industry. As the DOC will continue its investigation discussed above, companies may still be subject to tariffs after the moratorium ends; however, U.S. companies will reportedly be exempt from any retroactive tariffs that previously could have applied. The Biden Administration also announced that it plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to accelerate the production of solar panels in the U.S. The Biden Administration's actions did not address whether WROs applied to panels under previous complaints would be affected. 

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
 
 In November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides for approximately 1.2 trillion of federal spending over the next five years, including approximately 85 billion for investments in power, utilities, and renewables infrastructure across the United States. We expect funding from this Act will support the work we are doing to reduce GHG emissions, increase EV charging, and strengthen and protect the energy grid. Funding in the Act should also help to expand emerging technologies, like hydrogen and carbon management, as we continue the transition to a clean energy future. We believe the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will accelerate investment in projects that will help us meet our net zero emission goals to the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve, and our company. 

Inflation Reduction Act 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which provides for 258 billion in energy-related provisions over a 10-year period. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, lower gasoline and electricity prices, incentivize domestic 
 2022 Form 10-K 43 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 clean energy investment, manufacturing, and production, and promote reductions in carbon emissions. We believe that we and our customers can benefit from the IRA s provisions that extend tax benefits for renewable technologies, increase or restore higher rates for PTCs, add an option to claim PTCs for solar projects, expand qualified ITC facilities to include standalone energy storage, and its provision to allow companies to transfer tax credits generated from renewable projects. The IRA also implements a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases. Although significant regulatory guidance is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, we currently believe the provisions on alternative minimum tax and stock repurchases will not have a material impact on us. Overall, we believe the IRA will help reduce our cost of investing in projects that will support our commitment to reduce emissions and provide customers affordable, reliable, and clean energy over the longer term. 

Environmental Matters 
 
 See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change. 

Market Risks and Other Significant Risks 
 
 We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: 

Commodity Costs 
 
 In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs. 
 
 Embedded within our rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. We have recovery mechanisms in place that allow us to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business D. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms. 
 
 Higher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. See Note 5, Credit Losses, for more information on our mechanism that allows for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense. 

Weather 
 
 Our utility rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The fixed charge included in our natural gas rates helps to mitigate the impacts of weather. A summary of actual weather information in our service territory during 2022 and 2021, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations. 

Interest Rates 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. 
 
 Based on our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by 1.9 million and 3.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.

 Marketable Securities Return 
 
 We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. The financial risks associated with investment returns are mitigated through the requirement that we implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024, as required by the December 2022 rate order issued by the PSCW. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our 2023 and 2024 rates. 
 
 The fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately: 
 (in millions) As of December 31, 2022 Expected Return on Assets in 2023 Pension trust funds 685.1 7.00 OPEB trust funds 255.6 7.00 
 
 Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers. 
 
 WEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help it forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds. 

Economic Conditions 
 
 Our service territories are within the state of Wisconsin. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products. 

Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions 
 
 We continue to monitor the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. We monitor the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance costs, and other costs in order to minimize inflationary effects in future years, to the extent possible, through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We monitor the global supply chain, and related disruptions, in order to ensure we are able to procure the necessary materials and other resources necessary to both maintain our energy services in a safe and reliable manner and to grow our infrastructure in accordance with WEC Energy Group's capital plan, which includes us. For additional information concerning risks related to inflation and supply chain disruptions, see the three risk factors below. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our operations and corporate strategy may be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions and inflation. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business We are actively involved with multiple significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Economic and Market Volatility Fluctuating commodity prices could negatively impact our electric and natural gas utility operations. 
 
 For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies, as well as the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments that could have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. Judgments regarding future events may include the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. Actual results may differ significantly from estimated amounts based on varying assumptions. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and may change in subsequent periods. 

Regulatory Accounting 
 
 Our utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. 
 
 Future recovery of regulatory assets, including the timeliness of recovery and our ability to earn a reasonable return, is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, rate orders issued by our regulators, historical decisions by our regulators regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. 
 
 The application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities. 

Goodwill 
 
 We completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our utility reporting unit as of July 1, 2022. No impairment was recorded as a result of this test. At July 1, 2022, our utility reporting unit had 36.4 million of goodwill. The fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than its carrying value. The fair value of our reporting unit was calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach received a weighting of 60 while the market approached received a weighting of 40 to determine an overall valuation. 
 
 For the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since our reporting unit is regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to decrease. 
 
 Key assumptions used in the income approach included ROE, the long-term growth rate used to determine the terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rate. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair value will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE is driven by our current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for our service area. 
 
 For the market approach, we used a higher weighting for the guideline public company method than the guideline merged and acquired company method due to a low number of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company 
 2022 Form 10-K 46 
 Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 

Table of Contents 

 method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting unit to determine fair value. 
 
 The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the result of the test. 
 
 At July, 1, 2022, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by over 50 . Based on this result, our reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. 
 
 See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for more information. 

Long-Lived Assets 
 
 In accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, a regulatory decision related to recovery of assets from customers, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold or abandoned. See Note 1(j), Asset Impairment, for our policy on accounting for abandonments. 
 
 Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment by management in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset in comparison to the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is assessed using various methods, including internally developed discounted cash flow analysis, expected recovery of regulated assets, and analysis from outside advisors. 
 
 See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our generating units probable of being retired. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW. 

Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits 
 
 The costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 19, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. 
 
 Pension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs. 
 
 Pension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Changes in benefit costs are mitigated through the requirement that we implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024, as required by the December 2022 rate order issued by the PSCW. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our 2023 and 2024 rates.

 The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost (including amounts capitalized to our balance sheets). Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

 The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost (including amounts capitalized to our balance sheets). Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only. 
 Actuarial Assumption

 Percentage-Point Change in Assumption Impact on Postretirement Benefit Obligation Impact on 2022 Postretirement Benefit Cost Discount rate (0.5) 5.8 0.7 Discount rate 0.5 (5.1) (0.7) Health care cost trend rate (0.5) (4.1) (1.4) Health care cost trend rate 0.5 4.6 1.6 Rate of return on plan assets (0.5) N/A 1.5 Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 N/A (1.5) 
 
 The discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable, high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments. 
 
 We establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 7.00 in 2022, 2021, and 2020. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (16.93) , 10.19 , and 14.63 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 
 In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 19, Employee Benefits. 

Unbilled Revenues 
 
 We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. 
 
 Unbilled revenues are estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in rate mix due to fluctuations in usage patterns of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total unbilled utility revenues were 92.4 million and 73.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The changes in unbilled revenues are primarily due to changes in the cost of natural gas, weather, and customer rates. 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our

 financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(n), Income Taxes, and Note 16, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes. 
 
 We are required to estimate income taxes for each of our applicable tax jurisdictions as part of the process of preparing financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements. 
 
 Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations, the outcomes of tax audits and appeals, changes in income tax law, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax, and changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns. 
 
 We expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be between 19.0 and 20.0 . Our effective tax rate calculations are revised every quarter based on the best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

A. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of rate regulation on financial statements Refer to Notes 6 and 23 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company is subject to regulation by state and federal regulatory bodies (collectively the Commissions which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas distribution. Management has determined the Company meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the Regulated Operations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standard Codification.

 Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the Company s regulators. Future decisions of the Commissions will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates, and any refunds that may be required. 
 
 While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment or (3) timely recovery of costs incurred. The Company had 365.5 million and 660.2 million of regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Given that management s accounting judgments can be based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following procedures, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over regulatory assets and liabilities, including management s controls over the identification of costs recorded as regulatory assets and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. 
 
 We inquired of Company management and independently obtained and read: (1) relevant regulatory orders issued by the state and federal Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, (2) company filings, (3) filings made by intervenors and (4) other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. To assess completeness, we evaluated the information obtained and compared it to management s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances. 
 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 
 
 We obtained management s analysis regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. 
 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. For our residential and commercial and industrial customers, our performance obligation is bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the electric commodity. 
 
 The transaction price of the performance obligations for residential and commercial and industrial customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in our tariffs, which have been approved by the PSCW. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on the quantity of electricity delivered each month. Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs, which also impact our revenues. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. We monitor the deferral of under-collected costs to ensure that it does not cause us to earn a greater ROE than authorized by the PSCW. In addition, our residential tariffs include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. 
 
 Wholesale customers who resell power can choose to either bundle capacity and electricity services together under contract with a supplier or purchase capacity and electricity separately from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, wholesale customers can choose to have us provide generation to match the customer's load, similar to requirements contracts, or they can purchase specified quantities of electricity and capacity. Contracts with wholesale customers that include capacity bundled with the delivery of electricity contain performance obligations, as capacity and electricity are often transacted separately in the marketplace at the wholesale level. When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each

 days. 
 
 Natural Gas Utility Operating Revenues 
 
 We recognize natural gas utility operating revenues under requirements contracts with residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers served under our tariffs. Tariffs provide our customers with the standard terms and conditions, including rates, related to the services offered. Requirements contracts provide for the delivery of as much natural gas as the customer needs. These requirements contracts represent discrete deliveries of natural gas and constitute a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Our performance obligation is both created and satisfied with the transfer of control of natural gas upon delivery to the customer. For most of our customers, natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. A performance obligation can be bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the natural gas commodity. In certain of our service territories, customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the performance obligation only includes the delivery of the natural gas to the customer. 
 
 The transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in our tariffs, which have been approved by the PSCW. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month. 
 
 Our tariffs include various rate mechanisms that allow us to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. Our rates include a one-for-one recovery mechanism for natural gas commodity costs. Under normal circumstances, we defer any difference between actual natural gas costs incurred and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year. However, as a result of the extreme weather in the Midwest in February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas customers was temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal winter weather expectations. See Note 23, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the recovery of these high natural gas costs. 
 
 In addition, our residential tariffs include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.

 Other Operating Revenues 
 
 Alternative Revenues 
 
 Alternative revenues are created from programs authorized by regulators that allow us to record additional revenues by adjusting rates in the future, usually as a surcharge applied to future billings, in response to past activities or completed events. We record alternative revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. We reverse these alternative revenues as the customer is billed, at which time this revenue is presented as revenues from contracts with customers. 
 
 Our only alternative revenue program relates to the wholesale electric service that we provide to customers under market-based rates and FERC formula rates. The customer is charged a base rate each year based upon a formula using prior year actual costs and customer demand. A true-up is calculated based on the difference between the amount billed to customers for the demand component of their rates and what the actual cost of service was for the year. The true-up can result in an amount that we will recover from or refund to the customer. We consider the true-up portion of the wholesale electric revenues to be alternative revenues. 

accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances were reported in the other segment at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances considering a combination of factors. For some of our larger customers and also in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for credit losses against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we use the accounts receivable aging method to calculate an allowance for credit losses. Using this method, we classify accounts receivable into different aging buckets and calculate a reserve percentage for each aging bucket based upon historical loss rates. The calculated reserve percentages are updated on at least an annual basis, in order to ensure recent macroeconomic, political, and regulatory trends are captured in the calculation, to the extent possible. Risks identified that we do not believe are reflected in the calculated reserve percentages, are assessed on a quarterly basis to determine whether further adjustments are required.

. The exercise price of a stock option under the plan cannot be less than of the fair market value of WEC Energy Group common stock on the grant date. Historically, all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of WEC Energy Group common stock on the date of the grant. Options vest immediately upon retirement, death, or disability; however, they may not be exercised within of the grant date except in connection with certain termination of employment events following a change in control. Options expire no later than years from the date of grant. 
 
 WEC Energy Group stock options are classified as equity awards. The fair value of each stock option was calculated using a binomial option-pricing model. 
 Estimated weighted-average fair value per stock option Assumptions used to value the options: Risk-free interest rate 

Dividend yield Expected volatility Expected life (years) 
 
 The risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury interest rate with a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield was based on WEC Energy Group's dividend rate at the time of the grant and historical stock prices. Expected volatility and expected life assumptions were based on WEC Energy Group's historical experience. 
 
 Restricted Shares 
 
 WEC Energy Group restricted shares granted to our employees have a vesting period of with one-third of the award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. The restricted shares are classified as equity awards. 
 
 Performance Units 
 
 Officers and other key employees are granted performance units under the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan. All grants of performance units are settled in cash and are accounted for as liability awards accordingly. Performance units accrue forfeitable dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance units. The fair value of the performance units reflects our estimate of the final expected value of the awards, which is based on WEC Energy Group's stock price and performance achievement under the terms of the award. Stock-based compensation costs are generally recorded over the performance period, which is . 
 
 The ultimate number of units that will be awarded is dependent on WEC Energy Group's total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) as compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over , as well as other performance metrics, as may be determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the terms of awards granted prior to 2023, participants may earn between and of the performance unit award based on WEC Energy Group's total shareholder return. Pursuant to the plan terms governing these awards, these percentages can be adjusted upwards or downwards by up to based on WEC Energy Group's performance against additional performance measures, if any, adopted by the Compensation Committee. 
 
 The WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2023. In accordance with the amended plan, the Compensation Committee selected multiple performance measures that will be weighted to determine the ultimate payout for the awards granted in 2023. The ultimate number of units awarded will be based on WEC Energy Group's total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over ), and WEC Energy Group's performance against the weighted average authorized ROE of all of its utility subsidiaries ).

 The allowance for credit losses increased during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that the high energy costs that customers are seeing, which have been driven by high natural gas prices, contributed to higher past due accounts receivable balances and a related increase in the allowance for credit losses. The increase was substantially offset by customer write-offs related to collection practices returning to pre-pandemic levels, including the restoration of our ability to disconnect customers. After a customer is disconnected for a period of time without payment on their account, we will write off that customer balance. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to normal collection practices resuming in April 2021. Higher year-over-year natural gas prices drove an increase in gross accounts receivable balances, partially offsetting the decrease in the allowance for credit losses attributed to collection efforts.

 WEC Energy Group consults with its investment advisors on an annual basis to help forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing historical returns as well as calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the trust. For 2023, the expected return on asset assumption for the pension plan and OPEB plans is . 
 
 Plan Assets 
 
 Current pension trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future are expected to be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees. 
 
 The Investment Trust Policy Committee oversees investment matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an on-going basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. They are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. 
 
 Our pension trust target asset allocations are equity investments, fixed income investments, and private equity and real estate investments. The OPEB trust has a target asset allocation of equity investments, fixed income investments, and real estate investments. Equity securities include investments in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage and other asset backed securities, commercial paper, and United States Treasuries. 
 
 Pension and OPEB plan investments are recorded at fair value. See Note 1(o), Fair Value Measurements, for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and the classification of fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used.

We note that, to the extent we use RICE engines for natural gas distribution operations, those engines may be subject to the emission limits and operational requirements of the rule beginning in 2026. In June 2022, we submitted comments on this proposed rule seeking clarification of its applicability, as well as other items, and we will closely monitor the final rule for any changes from the proposed rule. 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
 
 Ozone 
 
 After completing its review of the 2008 ozone standard, the EPA released a final rule in October 2015, creating a more stringent standard than the 2008 NAAQS. The 2015 ozone standard lowered the 8-hour limit for ground-level ozone. In November 2022, the EPA's 2022 CASAC Ozone Review Panel issued a draft report supporting a previously issued EPA staff-written Integrated Science Assessment for ozone which supported the reconsideration of the 2015 standard. The EPA had planned a proposed rule in April 2023, but the CASAC review is expected to slow the process. 
 
 In June 2021, the EPA published its final action to revise the nonattainment area designations and/or boundaries for counties associated with nonattainment areas, including several in Illinois and Wisconsin. Under the new designations, the partial nonattainment areas of Sheboygan, Door, and Manitowoc counties were also expanded. 
 
 In February 2022, revisions to the Wisconsin Administrative Code to adopt the 2015 standard were finalized. The amended regulations adopted the standard and incorporated by reference the federal air pollution monitoring requirements related to the standard. The WDNR submitted the rule updates as a SIP revision to the EPA in April 2022, which the EPA proposed to approve in August 2022. 
 
 We believe that we are well positioned to meet the requirements associated with the 2015 ozone standard and do not expect to incur significant costs to comply with the associated state and federal rules.

 revisions were necessary to the current annual standard of g/m 3 or the 24-hour standard of g/m 3 . Under the Biden Administration's policy review, the EPA concluded that the scientific evidence and information from the December 2020 determination supports revising the level of the annual standard for the PM NAAQS to below the current level of g/m 3 , while retaining the 24-hour standard. In January 2023, the EPA announced its proposed decision to revise the primary (health-based) annual PM2.5 standard from its current level of g/m 3 to within the range of to g/m 3 . The EPA also proposed not to change the current secondary (welfare-based) annual PM2.5 standard, primary and secondary 24-hour PM2.5 standards, and primary and secondary PM10 standards. The EPA is also taking comments on the full range (between and g/m 3 included in the CASAC's latest report. We anticipate the final rule to be released in late 2023. All counties within our service territories are in attainment with the current 2012 standards. If the EPA lowers the annual standard to or g/m 3 , our generating facilities within our service territories should remain in attainment. If the EPA lowers it to below g/m 3 , there could be some nonattainment areas that may affect permitting of some smaller ancillary equipment located at our facilities. After finalization of the rule, the WDNR will need to draft a SIP and submit for the EPA's approval. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 The ACE rule, which replaced the Clean Power Plan, was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2021. In October 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling vacating the EPA's ACE rule and in June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision. The Supreme Court found that the EPA may regulate GHGs under section 111 of the CAA but cannot rely on generation shifting to lower carbon emitting sources to do so. We expect a new GHG replacement rule for existing sources to be proposed in March 2023. 
 
 In January 2021, the EPA finalized a rule to revise the NSPS for GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fueled power plants; however, it was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2021. Based on an updated EPA regulatory timeline, we expect a new rule to be proposed in March 2023. We continue to move forward on the ESG Progress Plan, which is heavily focused on reducing GHG emissions. 
 
 The EPA released proposed regulations for the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 CFR Part 98, in June 2022. The proposed revisions could impact the reporting required of our local natural gas distribution companies and underground natural gas storage facilities with updates to emission factors for equipment counts and increased disclosure for large release events. We expect the final rule in 2023, pending the EPA's review and consideration of public comments. 
 
 The ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fueled generation. We have already retired approximately MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018. Through its ESG Progress Plan, WEC Energy Group expects to retire approximately MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, which includes the planned retirement by June 2026 of jointly-owned Columbia Units 1-2. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the timing of the retirements. In May 2021, WEC Energy Group announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from its electric generation fleet by by the end of 2025 and by by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. WEC Energy Group expects to achieve these goals by making operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing its capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for WEC Energy Group's generation fleet is net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. 
 
 WEC Energy Group also continues to reduce methane emissions by improving its natural gas distribution system and has set a target across its natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. WEC Energy Group plans to achieve its net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout its utility systems. 
 
 We are required to report our CO 2 equivalent emissions from the electric generating facilities we operate under the EPA Greenhouse Gases Reporting Program. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the data, we estimate that we will report CO 2 equivalent emissions of approximately million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2022. The level of CO 2 and other GHG emissions varies from year to year and is dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and how our units are dispatched by MISO.

 Water Quality 
 
 Clean Water Act Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule 
 
 In August 2014, the EPA issued a final regulation under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act that requires the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The federal rule became effective in October 2014 and applies to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures. 
 
 In 2016, the WDNR initiated a state rulemaking process to incorporate the federal Section 316(b) requirements into the Wisconsin Administrative Code. This new state rule, NR 111, became effective in June 2020, and the WDNR will apply it when establishing BTA requirements for cooling water intake structures at existing facilities. These BTA requirements are incorporated into WPDES permits for our facilities. 
 
 We have received interim BTA determinations for Weston Units 2, 3, and 4. In addition, we believe that existing technology installed at the Weston facility will result in a final BTA determination during the WPDES permit reissuance in 2023. 
 
 As a result of past capital investments completed to address Section 316(b) compliance, we believe our fleet overall is well positioned to continue to meet this regulation and do not expect to incur significant additional compliance costs. 
 
 Steam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines 
 
 The EPA's final 2015 ELG rule took effect in January 2016 and was modified in 2020 to revise the treatment technology requirements related to BATW at existing facilities. This rule created new requirements for several types of power plant wastewaters. The new requirement that affects us relates to discharge limits for BATW. Our Weston power plant facility already has advanced wastewater treatment technologies installed that meet many of the discharge limits established by this rule. There will, however, need to be facility modifications to meet water permit requirements for the BATW system at Weston Unit 3, which is expected to be completed by December 2023. Based on existing contracts and engineering cost estimates, we expect that compliance with the ELG rule will require approximately million in capital investment. The BATW modifications do not require PSCW approval prior to construction. This ELG required project is on track for completion by the WPDES permit deadline in December 2023. 
 
 In July 2021, the EPA announced its intention to initiate a "supplemental rulemaking" to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule that was finalized in late 2020. The EPA has stated that the 2020 ELG Rule will continue to be implemented and enforced while the agency pursues this rulemaking process. As part of their regulatory agenda, the EPA Office of Water included plans to issue a direct final rule reopening the NOPP deadline to enter the cessation of the coal subcategory (i.e. unit retirements or conversions to natural gas by the end of December 2028 instead of making capital investments to add more treatment technology) established in the 2020 ELG Rule. The new NOPP deadline will be 90 days after publication in the Federal Register , which is anticipated during the first quarter of 2023. The EPA will publish the direct final rule at the same time as the proposed ELG supplemental rulemaking. 
 
 Waters of the United States 
 
 In January 2023, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers together released a final rule revising the definition of WOTUS. This rule will be effective March 20, 2023. The final rule states that it is based on the pre-2015 definition of "waters of the United States." The pre-2015 approach involves applying factors established through case law and agency precedents to determine whether a wetland or surface drainage feature is subject to federal jurisdiction. 
 
 The recent rulemaking could be affected by a significant pending Supreme Court case involving WOTUS determination. In January 2022, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in a case, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency , to evaluate the proper test for determining whether wetlands are WOTUS. A decision by the Supreme Court is expected in spring 2023.

 Reserves for future environmental remediation 
 
 Renewables, Efficiency, and Conservation 
 
 Wisconsin Legislation 
 
 In 2005, Wisconsin enacted Act 141, which established a goal that of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources annually. We have achieved our required renewable energy percentage of by constructing various wind parks, solar parks, and by also relying on renewable energy purchases. We continue to review our renewable energy portfolio and acquire cost-effective renewables as needed to meet our requirements on an ongoing basis. The PSCW administers the renewable program related to Act 141, and we fund the program, along with other utilities, based on of our annual retail operating revenues. 
 
 Enforcement and Litigation Matters 
 
 We are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, management believes that appropriate reserves have been established and that final settlement of these actions will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Consent Decrees 
 
 Weston and Pulliam Power Plants 
 
 In November 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to us, which alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements relating to certain projects completed at the Weston and Pulliam power plants from 1994 to 2009. We entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in

 In addition to the above, the final order includes the following terms: 
 
 We will keep our current earnings sharing mechanism, under which, if we earn above our authorized ROE: (i) we will retain of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) of the next 60 basis points will be required to be refunded to ratepayers; and (iii) of any remaining excess earnings will be required to be refunded to ratepayers. 
 We are required to complete an analysis of alternative recovery scenarios for generating units that will be retired prior to the end of their useful life. 
 We will not propose any changes to our real time pricing rates for large commercial and industrial electric customers through the end of 2024. 
 We will lower monthly residential and small commercial electric customer fixed charges by from currently authorized rates. 
 We will offer an additional voluntary renewable energy pilot for commercial and industrial customers. 
 We will work with PSCW staff and other interested parties to develop alternative low income assistance programs. We, along with WE, will also collectively contribute million to the Keep Wisconsin Warm Fund. 
 We are required to implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024. 
 We are authorized to file a limited electric rate case re-opener for 2024 to address changes to revenue requirements associated with generation projects that are expected to be placed into service in 2023 and 2024 and future plant retirements. 
 
 2022 Rates 
 
 In March 2021, we filed an application with the PSCW for the approval of certain accounting treatments that allowed us to maintain our electric and natural gas base rates through 2022 and forego filing a rate case for . In connection with the request, we also entered into an agreement, dated March 23, 2021, with various stakeholders. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the stakeholders fully supported the application. In September 2021, the PSCW issued a written order approving the application. 
 
 The final order reflected the following: 
 
 We amortized, in 2022, certain previously deferred balances to offset approximately half of our forecasted revenue deficiency. 
 We were able to defer any increases in tax expense due to changes in tax law that occurred in 2021 and/or 2022. 
 We maintained our earnings sharing mechanism for 2022, with modification. The earnings sharing mechanism was modified to authorize us to retain of the first 15 basis points of earnings above our currently authorized ROE. The earnings sharing mechanism otherwise remained as previously authorized. 
 
 2020 and 2021 Rates 
 
 In March 2019, we filed an application with the PSCW to increase our retail electric and natural gas rates, effective January 1, 2020. In August 2019, we filed an application with the PSCW for approval of a settlement agreement entered into with certain intervenors to resolve several outstanding issues in our rate case. In December 2019, the PSCW issued a written order that approved the settlement agreement without material modification and addressed the remaining outstanding issues that were not included in the settlement agreement. The new rates were effective January 1, 2020.

 . Approximately million of tax benefits were amortized in 2020 and approximately million were amortized in 2021. Unprotected deferred tax benefits by their nature are eligible to be returned to customers in a manner and timeline determined to be appropriate by the PSCW. 
 
 (2) The rate order was net of million of refunds related to our 2018 earnings sharing mechanism. These refunds were made to customers evenly over , with half returned in 2020 and the remainder returned in 2021. 
 
 (3) Amount is net of certain deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation that were utilized to reduce near-term rate impacts. The rate order reflected all of the unprotected deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation being amortized evenly over , which results in approximately million of previously deferred tax benefits being amortized each year. Unprotected deferred tax benefits by their nature are eligible to be returned to customers in a manner and timeline determined to be appropriate by the PSCW. 
 
 The rate order allows us to collect the previously deferred revenue requirement for ReACT costs above the authorized million level. The total cost of the ReACT project was million. This regulatory asset is being collected from customers over . 
 
 The PSCW approved us continuing to have an earnings sharing mechanism through 2021. The earnings sharing mechanism was modified from its previous structure to one that was consistent with other Wisconsin investor-owned utilities. Under this earnings sharing mechanism, if we earned above our authorized ROE: (i) we retained of earnings for the first 25 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) of the next 50 basis points were required to be refunded to customers; and (iii) of any remaining excess earnings were required to be refunded to customers. In addition, the rate order also required us to maintain residential and small commercial electric and natural gas customer fixed charges at previously authorized rates and to maintain the status quo for our electric market-based rate programs for large industrial customers through 2021. 
 
 Recovery of Natural Gas Costs 
 
 Due to the cold temperatures, wind, snow, and ice throughout the central part of the country during February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas utility customers was temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal winter weather expectations. We have a regulatory mechanism in place for recovering all prudently incurred gas costs. 
 
 In March 2021, we filed our revised natural gas rate sheets with the PSCW reflecting approximately million of natural gas costs in excess of the benchmark set in our GCRM. We recovered these excess costs over a period of , beginning in April 2021. 
 
 Coronavirus Disease 2019 
 
 In March 2020, the PSCW issued orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first order required all public utilities in the state of Wisconsin, including us, to temporarily suspend disconnections, the assessment of late fees, and deposit requirements for all customer classes. In addition, it required utilities to reconnect customers that were previously disconnected, offer deferred payment arrangements to all customers, and streamline the application process for customers applying for utility service. 
 
 In the second order issued in March 2020, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin utilities to defer expenditures and certain foregone revenues resulting from compliance with the first order, and expenditures as otherwise incurred to ensure safe, reliable, and affordable access to utility services during the declared public health emergency. In December 2021, the PSCW approved a motion to end all COVID-related deferrals as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, we did not have any amounts deferred related to the COVID-19 pandemic as the rate order we received from the PSCW in December 2022 did not allow recovery of these costs. 
 
 In June 2020, the PSCW issued a written order providing a timeline for the lifting of the temporary provisions required in the first March 2020 order. Utilities were allowed to disconnect commercial and industrial customers and require deposits for new service as of July 25, 2020 and July 31, 2020, respectively. After August 15, 2020, utilities were no longer required to offer deferred payment arrangements to all customers. Additionally, utilities were authorized to reinstate late fees except for the period between the first order and this supplemental order. We resumed charging late payment fees in late August 2020. Late payment fees were not charged on outstanding balances that were billed between the first order and late August 2020. 
 
 Subsequent to the June 2020 order, the PSCW extended the moratorium on disconnections of residential customers until November 1, 2020. In accordance with Wisconsin regulations, utilities are generally not allowed to disconnect residential customers for non-payment during the winter moratorium, which customarily begins on November 1 and ends on April 15 of each year.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective: (i) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Audit and Oversight Committee (Audit Committee) of the Board of Directors of WEC Energy Group, which is comprised solely of independent directors, is responsible for reviewing and approving, in advance, all audit, audit-related, tax, and other services of the independent auditor. The Committee has the sole authority to select, evaluate, and where appropriate, terminate and replace the independent auditor. 
 
 The Audit Committee is committed to ensuring the independence of the auditor, both in appearance as well as in fact. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm. In addition, the Audit Committee is directly involved in the selection of the independent auditor's lead audit partner. 
 
 2022 Form 10-K 96

Table of Contents 

 Pre-Approval Process 
 
 Before engagement of the independent auditor for the next year's audit, the independent auditor will submit (i) a description of all services anticipated to be rendered during the following year, as well as an estimate of the fees for each of the services, for the Audit Committee to approve, and (ii) written confirmation that the performance of any non-audit services is permissible and will not impact the firm's independence. Annual pre-approval will be deemed effective for a period of twelve months from the date of the pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. A fee level will be established for all permissible, pre-approved non-audit services. Any additional audit service, audit related service, tax service and other service must also be pre-approved. 
 
 The Audit Committee delegated pre-approval authority to the Audit Committee's chair. The Audit Committee chair is required to report any pre-approval decisions at the next Audit Committee meeting. Under the pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee may not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor. 
 
 Prohibited Activities are services prohibited by the SEC or by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to be performed by our independent auditor. These services include: 
 
 bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Company; 
 financial information systems design and implementation; 
 appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; 
 actuarial services; 
 internal audit outsourcing services; 
 management functions or human resources;
