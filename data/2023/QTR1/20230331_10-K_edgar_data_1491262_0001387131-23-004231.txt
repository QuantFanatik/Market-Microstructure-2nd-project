PART

ITEM
 1. Business 

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 10-A, L.P. (the Registrant or the Partnership is a limited partnership organized under the
laws of the State of Delaware on February 9, 2010 (date of inception). Mewbourne Development Corporation MD ), a Delaware
Corporation, has been appointed as the Registrant s managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Registrant. 

Limited
and general partner interests in the Registrant were offered at 5,000 each to accredited investors in a private placement pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, for a total of 73,000,000 sold. During 2012 all
general partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests 

The
Partnership participates in oil and natural gas activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the Program ). The Partnership
and MD are parties to the Program Agreement. The Registrant engages primarily in oil and natural gas development and production and is
not involved in any other industry segment. The Program is governed by a Drilling Program Agreement between the Registrant, MD and Mewbourne
Oil Company MOC ), the Program manager and a wholly owned subsidiary of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent
of MD. MD does not make any capital contributions directly to the Registrant; rather, MD makes its capital contributions directly to
the Program. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of the Registrant s revenue, income and identifiable
assets. 

The
sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Registrant will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant s
control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive
fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas,
and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Registrant. 

The
market for crude oil is such that the Registrant anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural gas will
be sold to natural gas marketers and end users on the spot market. The spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas without long-term
contractual commitments. The future market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may experience
delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices. 

3 

Many
aspects of the Registrant s activities are highly competitive including, but not limited to, the acquisition of suitable drilling
prospects and the procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment, and are subject to governmental regulation, both at Federal
and state levels. The Registrant s ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing general partner s
staff and facilities, none of which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and natural gas exploration, development, and
production industry as a whole. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas operations generally includes operational activity,
drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage, the imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of income and
other items, and the protection of the environment. 

The
Registrant does not have any employees of its own. MD is responsible for all management functions. MOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant s managing general partner, has been appointed Program Manager
and is responsible for activities in accordance with a Drilling Program Agreement entered into by the Registrant, MD and MOC. On March
31, 2023, MOC employed 636 persons, many of whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant s business during
the period for which this report is filed. 

The
production of oil and natural gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors although the price received by the Registrant for natural
gas sales will generally tend to increase during the winter months. Order backlog is not pertinent to the Registrant s business. 

Industry
Operating Environment 

The
oil and natural gas industry is affected by many factors that the Partnership generally cannot control, including the prices of oil and
natural gas. Global macroeconomic factors contributing to uncertainty within the industry include real or perceived geopolitical risks
in oil-producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with forecasted
global supply; supply levels of oil and natural gas due to exploration and development activities in the United States; global health
concerns; environmental and climate change regulation; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC 
the Russia/Ukraine conflict; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Weather also has a significant impact
on demand for natural gas since it is a primary heating source in the United States.

 Properties 

Property
Interests 

The
Registrant s properties consist primarily of interests in properties on which oil and natural gas wells are located. Such property
interests are often subject to landowner royalties, overriding royalties and other oil and natural gas leasehold interests. 

Fractional
working interests in developmental oil and natural gas prospects, located primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas
Panhandle, and the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the Registrant, resulting in the Registrant s participation
in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells. As of December 31, 2022, the Registrant owned working interests in 122 producing wells.
The Registrant had no drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additional capital costs incurred, if any, were
due to maintenance of current wells.

 Legal
 Proceedings 

From
time to time, the Registrant may be a party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the
outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, the Partnership does not expect these matters to have a material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 5. Market
 for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
 Equity Securities 

On
March 31, 2023, the Registrant had 14,600 outstanding limited partnership interests held of record by 1,901 subscribers. There is no
established public or organized trading market for the partner interests. 

Cash
received from sales of oil and natural gas which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner, are not required to meet the
Registrant s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant s Partnership
Agreement. Distributions made to partners and state tax payments for the benefit of investor partners during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 were 4,742,360 and 2,825,800, respectively. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of 79,501,673,
inclusive of state tax payments for the benefit of investor partners. 

ITEM

 (Reserved) 

ITEM 7. Management s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

The
Registrant was formed to engage primarily in the business of drilling development wells, to produce and market crude oil and natural
gas produced from such properties, to distribute any net proceeds from operations to the general and limited partners and to the extent
necessary, acquire leases which contain drilling prospects. The economic life of the Registrant depends on the period over which the
Registrant s oil and natural gas reserves are economically recoverable. 

Current
Price Environment 

Oil
and natural gas prices are determined by many factors outside of the Partnership s control. Historically, world-wide oil and natural
gas prices and markets have been subject to significant change and may continue to be in the future. Global macroeconomic factors contributing
to uncertainty within the industry include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil-producing regions of the world, particularly the
Middle East; forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with forecasted global supply; supply levels of oil and natural gas
due to exploration and development activities in the United States; environmental and climate change regulation; actions taken by OPEC;
and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. 

6 

Additionally,
the ongoing conflict and the continuation of, or any increase in the severity of, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led and
may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and natural gas prices. 

However,
continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending national, regional,
and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, such as mandates for renewable
energy. 

The
trend in oil and natural gas regulation has been to increase regulatory restrictions and limitations on such activities. Any changes
in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations may result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of
projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport,
remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership.

Oil
and natural gas revenues. Oil and natural gas sales increased by 1,346,776 a 26.6 increase, for the year ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Of
this increase, 1,420,235 and 414,527 were due to increases in the average prices of oil and natural gas sold, respectively. The average
price rose to 94.62 from 66.60 per barrel (bbl) of oil and to 7.45 from 5.97 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas for the
year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Partially
offsetting these increases were decreases of 441,800 and 46,186 due to decreases in the volumes of oil and natural gas sold, respectively,
by 4,669 bbls of oil and 6,201 mcf natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Lease
operations. Lease operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased to 1,098,152 from 835,448 for the year ended
December 31, 2021 due to more well repairs and workovers. 

Production
taxes. Production taxes during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased to 504,542 from 388,508 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This was due to higher overall oil and natural gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

7 

Administrative
and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 rose to 298,767 from 255,570 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. This was due to higher total administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership . 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 203,067 from
 224,650 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was due to a lower net full cost pool resulting from prior period depreciation, depletion
and amortization deductions and cost ceiling write-downs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
increased by 18,283 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash received from sales of oil and natural gas were utilized primarily
for cash distributions to partners. All wells for which funds have been committed have been drilled; the Partnership has no planned drilling
activity in the future. Any incidental future capital expenditures incurred will be paid with current available cash and revenues generated
through oil and natural gas sales. Cash received from sales of oil and natural gas which, in the sole judgment of the managing general
partner, are not required to meet the Registrant s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least quarterly in accordance
with the Registrant s Partnership Agreement. Management believes they have sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months and beyond. 

Additionally,
the ongoing conflict and the continuation of, or any increase in the severity of, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led and
may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and natural gas prices. 

However,
continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending national, regional,
and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, such as mandates for renewable
energy. 

The
trend in oil and natural gas regulation has been to increase regulatory restrictions and limitations on such activities. Any changes
in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations may result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of
projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport,
remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership. 

Future
capital requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds generated from oil and natural gas activities. No bank borrowing
is anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of 677,275 as of December 31, 2022. 

Critical
Accounting Policies And Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Proved
reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Material revisions
(upward and downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the
quality pf available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgement. These inputs and assumptions all require a
high degree of subjectivity and could have a material impact on the overall estimate of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes and
associated future cash flows and the related measurement of DD A expense or the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. We
believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates. 

8 

All
financing activities of the Registrant are reported in the financial statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements. Additionally, the Registrant has no contractual obligations but has a financial obligation to plug and abandon
non-producing properties as discussed below. 

Full
Cost Method of Accounting 

The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive
and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and natural gas properties. On December 31, 2022 and 2021, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and
losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved
oil and natural gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the
present value of estimated future net cash flows of proved reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first day of the
month oil and natural gas prices, adjusted by a pricing differential associated with the particular property discounted at 10 , and the
lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. If unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess is charged to expense
in the period the excess occurs. There were no cost ceiling write-downs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Asset
Retirement Obligations 

The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value
of the future plugging and abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new well is
drilled. Depletion expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology. 

The
Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability
is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment
costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion
expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well. 

A
reconciliation of the Partnership s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs as of and for the years ended December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021 is as follows:

of oil and natural gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially
all transactions are with MD and MOC. 

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will be allocated its portion of these costs based upon its ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and natural gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of natural gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of
which will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Amounts paid to MOC for operator charges
totaled 517,910 and 426,566 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance
with the Program and Partnership Agreements. 

In
accordance with the Partnership agreement, during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated
to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5 of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the
sum of 50,000 plus 0.25 of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Administrative expenses can only be paid out
of funds available for distributions. Under this arrangement, 241,847 and 176,954 were allocated to the Partnership during the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The
Partnership participates in oil and natural gas activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the Program ). The Partnership
and MD are parties to the Program Agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows: 

Partnership 
 MD (1) 
 
 Revenues: 

Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties 
 75 
 25 
 
 All other revenues

 0 
 
 Operating costs, general and administrative expenses (except for reporting and legal expenses) and all other costs 
 75 
 25 

(1) As
 noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100 of organization and offering
 costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 15 of total capital costs. To
 the extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than
 15 of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share
 of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 15 . The Partnership s
 financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, MD s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of MD s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, MD's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Registrant s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Registrant to disclose material information
otherwise required to be set forth in the Registrant s periodic reports. 

((b)
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

MD s
management, as managing general partner of the Partnership, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of
MD s management, including MD s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, MD conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on MD s
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework , MD s management concluded that internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. This annual report does not include an attestation report of
the Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit the Registrant to provide only management s report in this annual report. There have been no changes in MD s
internal controls for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 or in other factors which have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect the internal controls over financial reporting.

MEWBOURNE

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

WITH
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

As
of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

17 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Partners
of Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A, L.P. and the 

 Board
of Directors of Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD) 

 Tyler,
Texas 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A, L.P. (the Partnership as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in partners capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years then ended , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Proved
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Estimation and Impact on Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization DD A Expense and
Full-Cost Ceiling Test Impairment Calculation Related to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties 

As
described in Note 2 to the financial statements, proved oil and natural gas reserves volumes and associated future net cash flows directly
impact the calculation of DD A expense and the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. There are numerous uncertainties inherent
in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves volumes and associated future net cash flows including, among others, estimated future
production volumes and timing of such production, pricing differentials, lease operating expenses, and amounts and timing of capital
expenditures. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation
and judgment. The estimation of oil and natural gas reserve volumes and associated future net cash flows requires management s
use of internal petroleum engineers and independent petroleum engineers and geologists (referred to as management s specialists ). 

18 

We
have identified the estimation and timing of future production volumes and lease operating expenses used to estimate oil and natural
gas reserves as a critical audit matter. These inputs and assumptions require a high degree of subjectivity and could have a material
impact on the overall estimate of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, the associated future cash flows and the related measurement
of DD A expense or the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. Auditing management s judgment with respect to these
inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment in the design of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the audit evidence obtained. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

Evaluating
 the professional qualifications of management s specialists and their relationship
 to the Partnership, making inquiries of management s specialists regarding the process
 followed and judgments used to assist in estimating the Partnership s proved oil and
 natural gas reserves, and reading the report prepared by the independent petroleum engineers
 and geologists. 

Comparing
 estimated production volumes and production decline analyses against results of actual production
 and actual production decline analyses to determine the appropriateness of management s
 estimates. 

Evaluating
 the estimates of lease operating expenses used in the reserve estimates compared to historical
 lease operating expenses. 

Evaluating
 management s estimates of oil and natural gas reserve volumes and lease operating expenses
 against evidence obtained in other areas of the audit for consistency and reasonableness.

Substantially
all the Partnership s accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales by Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) to third parties
in the oil and natural gas industry. This concentration of customers may impact the Partnership s overall credit risk in that these
entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. Historically, the Partnership has not experienced significant
credit losses on such receivables. No bad debt expense was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. The Partnership cannot
ensure that such losses will not occur in the future. 

The
Partnership has only non-operated working interests and royalty interests in oil and natural gas wells and receives monthly net revenue
checks from the operator of these oil and natural gas wells. Each unit of oil and natural gas is accounted for as a separate performance
obligation. It recognizes revenue for oil and condensate when control transfers to the purchaser at a contractually specified delivery
point at or near the wellhead at market prices in accordance with the contractual arrangement. Sales of natural gas applicable to the
Partnership s interest are recorded as revenue when the natural gas is metered and control is transferred pursuant to the natural
gas sales contracts covering the Partnership s interest in natural gas reserves. 

and , respectively. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of ,
inclusive of state tax payments for the benefit of investor partners. 

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will be allocated its portion of these costs based upon its ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and natural gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of natural gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of
which will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Amounts paid to MOC for operator charges
totaled and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance
with the Program and Partnership Agreements.

Re:
MEP 10A SEC CASE 

Dear
Mr. Buckley : 

At
your request, Legacy Petroleum Engineering (Legacy) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future production, and future net
income attributable to hydrocarbon interests owned by Mewbourne Energy Partnership 10A, L.P. (MEP10A) and managed by Mewbourne Development
Corporation (MDC). This evaluation was completed on February 8, 2023, and includes proved reserves
only. MDC has represented that these properties account for 100 percent of MDC s net proved
 reserves as of December 31, 2022. The properties are located in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. 

This
report has been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X and the guidelines specified
in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and with the exception of the exclusion of
future income taxes, conforms to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas. These guidelines
specify the use of a 12-month first-day-of-the-month average benchmark price and a 10 percent per year discount factor. Oil and gas prices,
expenses, and investments are held constant in this analysis. Actual future prices may vary significantly from the prices herein; therefore,
volumes of reserves actually recovered, and the amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities
presented in this report. The purpose of this report is for inclusion in certain SEC filings by MDC. The summary results of this analysis
are presented below:

1. The
 reserves shown are those estimated to be recoverable under the economic condition described
 herein. All reserve definitions incorporated in this study have been set forth in this report. 

2. MBbl
 = thousands of barrels, MMcf = millions of cubic feet, M = thousands of dollars. 

3. The
 discounted future net revenue is not represented to be the fair market value of these reserves.
 The estimated reserves included in this report have not been adjusted for risk. 

4. The
 reserves and revenues in the summary table were estimated using the Aries economics program.
 Due to the rounding procedures used in this program, there may be slight differences in the
 calculated and summed values. 

LEGACY PETROLEUM ENGINEERING 

Crude
oil and condensate volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBbl), with one barrel equivalent to 42 United States gallons. All
gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMcf) at the official temperature and
pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located. No gas imbalances have been taken into account. 

The
estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared using the economic software
package ARIES. The program was used at the request of MDC. The ARIES program is widely accepted in the industry to be thorough and accurate.
Certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not match the sum of the properties being summarized precisely. Furthermore,
one-line economic summaries may vary slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding.
The rounding differences are not material. 

The
estimated future net revenue shown represents what should be realized from the sale of estimated oil and gas reserves after the deduction
of severance taxes, ad valorem taxes, direct operating costs, and future capital expenditures. No deductions have been made for corporate
overhead, federal income taxes, or other indirect costs such as interest and loan repayments. 

RESERVES
AND ENGINEERING 

Proved
oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs. If an established production decline
curve was available, the extrapolation of historical production data was used for predicting ultimate reserves and time-rating oil and
gas production. Analogy to nearby wells (analogous reservoirs) was used for forecasting properties where insufficient data were present
for decline curve analysis. Production histories were provided by MDC and were compared to published production data obtained from a
third-party provider, Drillinginfo. Reserve definitions are included within the attachments. 

In
preparing the forecast of future proved production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by MDC which may have included geologic
interpretation, production, ownership, well tests, operating expenses, transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production
taxes, price differentials, capital costs, payout balances, geologic maps, well logs, core analyses, or pressure measurements. Legacy
reviewed the available data for its reasonableness and have accepted the data as represented. 

The
reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. The estimated reserves have not
been adjusted for risk. The revenues and costs could be more or less than the estimated amounts used for this report. These estimates
should be accepted with the understanding that future development, production history, changes in regulations, product prices, and operating
expenses could potentially require revisions in subsequent evaluations. A portion of these reserves may be from producing wells that
lack sufficient production history to utilize performance-related reserve estimates. These reserve estimates are subject to a greater
degree of uncertainty than those based on substantial production and pressure data. It may be necessary to revise these estimates up
or down in the future as additional performance data become available. 

As
in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geological data.
Therefore, our conclusions represent informed professional analysis, not statements of fact.

HYDROCARBON
PRICING 

The
benchmark hydrocarbon prices used herein are the preceding 12-month averages of the first-day-of-the-month (FDOM) spot prices posted
for the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and Henry Hub natural gas. The benchmark FDOM prices used in this report are 94.14 per barrel
of oil and condensate and 5.965/MMBtu for natural gas. Prices were held constant for this analysis. Product prices that were used to
determine future revenue for the properties reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, fuel usage and transportation
fees, referred to as price differentials. The differentials used in the preparation of this report were furnished by MDC and were reviewed
by Legacy. Average realized oil and gas prices after adjustments are 93.61 per barrel and 7.25 per Mcf, respectively. 

ADDITIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS 

Abandonment
costs have not been included in this analysis. Estimates of salvage value are included and scheduled at the end of the economic life
of individual properties. Salvage values have been provided by MDC. Our staff has not performed an on-site inspection of the properties
nor has the mechanical operation or condition of wells and their related facilities been examined. The costs associated with continued
operation of uneconomic properties are not reflected in the cash flows. The evaluation of potential environmental liability from the
operation and abandonment of the properties is beyond the scope of this report. No estimate of the potential economic liability, if any,
from environmental concerns is included in the projections presented herein. 

All
investments have been held constant in this analysis. Discounted revenue figures were calculated using a discount factor of 10 percent
per year. We consider the data and assumptions used in this report appropriate for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves
and future net revenues. The methodologies and procedures used in this analysis are appropriate for the purpose of this report.

GENERAL
COMMENTS 

(1) This
 report has been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32)
 of Regulation S-X and the guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K of the
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, with the exception of the exclusion of
 future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive
 Industries Oil and Gas. These guidelines specify the use of a 12 month first-day-of-the-month
 average benchmark price and a 10 percent per year discount factor. 

(2) Liquid
 hydrocarbons, including natural gas liquids (NGLs), are expressed in thousands of standard
 42 gallon barrels (MBbl). All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis 
 expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMcf) at the official temperature and pressure bases
 of the areas in which the gas reserves are located. Currency is expressed in thousands of
 dollars (M ). 

(3) The
 reserves included in this report are estimates only - not exact quantities. They may or may
 not be recovered; if recovered, the revenues and costs could be more or less than the estimated
 amounts used for this report. These estimates should be accepted with the understanding that
 future development, production history, changes in regulations, product prices, and operating
 expenses could result in revisions in subsequent evaluations. A portion of these reserves
 are for behind-pipe zones, undeveloped locations, and producing wells that lack sufficient
 production history to utilize performance-related reserve estimates. Therefore, these reserves
 are based on estimates of reservoir volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogies
 to similar production. These reserve estimates are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty
 than those based on substantial production and pressure data. It may be necessary to revise
 these estimates up or down in the future as additional performance data become available.
 As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation
 of engineering and geological data; therefore, our conclusions represent informed professional
 judgments only, not statements of fact. 

(4) These
 results for reserves shown in this report are not represented to be a fair market value for
 these reserves. The discounted future net revenue is not represented to be the fair market
 value of these reserves. 

(5) This
 report relies upon data furnished by the client which may have included geologic interpretation,
 production, ownership, well tests, direct costs, transportation and/or processing fees, ad
 valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, salvage values, pricing
 deductions and differentials, geologic maps, well logs, core analyses, or pressure measurements.
 We reviewed the available data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an
 independent verification of the data furnished. We consider the data used in this report
 appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future
 net revenues. Data may have been acquired from state regulatory agencies and commercially
 available data sources, also. Capital costs and timing of all investments have been provided
 and are included as required for workovers, new development wells, production equipment,
 and salvage value. Estimates of the salvage value are included and scheduled at the end of
 the economic life of individual properties. 

GENERAL COMMENTS - 1 

(6) We
 have accepted the client's intent to drill and complete any proved, probable, and possible
 undeveloped locations as scheduled and participate in non-operated wells. 

(7) On-site
 inspection of the properties has not been performed nor has the mechanical operation or condition
 of the wells and their related facilities been inspected. Additionally, the costs associated
 with the continued operation of uneconomic properties are not reflected in the cash flows.
 The evaluation of potential environmental liability from the operation and abandonment of
 the properties is beyond the scope of this report. No evaluation was made to determine the
 degree of operator compliance with current environmental rules, regulations, and/or reporting
 requirements. No estimate of the potential economic liability, if any, from environmental
 concerns is included in the projections presented. 

(8) LPE
 has made no investigation of possible gas sales imbalances that may have resulted from the
 over or under delivery to the client s interest. Our projections are based on the client s
 interest receiving its net revenue interest share of estimated future gross oil and gas production. 

(9) Any
 distribution of this report, in whole or part, must include these general comments and the
 cover letter in their entirety.

GENERAL COMMENTS - 2 

LEGACY PETROLEUM ENGINEERING 

DEFINITIONS
FOR OIL AND GAS RESERVES 

(1)
 Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses
and options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased
in fee, brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. 

(2)
 Analogous reservoir. Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir
conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the
reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery.
When used to support proved reserves, an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics
with the reservoir of interest: 

(i)
Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); 

(ii)
Same environment of deposition; 

(iii)
Similar geological structure; and 

(iv)
Same drive mechanism. 

(3)
 Bitumen. Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with
a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis.
In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. 

(4)
 Condensate. Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure,
but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. 

(5)
 Deterministic estimate. The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter
(from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 

(6)
 Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: 

(i)
Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor
compared to the cost of a new well; and 

(ii)
Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means
not involving a well. 

(7)
 Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering
and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment
and facilities and other costs of development activities are costs incurred to: 

These Reserves Definitions are in Accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X as of January 1, 2010. 

DEFINITIONS - 1 

(i)
Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development
drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary
in developing the proved reserves. 

(ii)
Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and
of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. 

(iii)
Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices,
and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems. 

(iv)
Provide improved recovery systems. 

(8)
 Development project. A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically
producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated
development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. 

(9)
 Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known
to be productive. 

(10)
 Economically producible. The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue
that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall
be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. 

(11)
 Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative
production as of that date. 

(12)
 Exploration costs. Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered
to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic
test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting
costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs
of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are: 

(i)
Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and
other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as
geological and geophysical or G G costs. 

DEFINITIONS - 2 

(ii)
Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title
defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records. 

(iii)
Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions. 

(iv)
Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells. 

(v)
Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. 

(13)
 Exploratory well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found
to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension
well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. 

(14)
 Extension well. An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. 

(15)
 Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological
structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening
impervious, strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent
fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition
 are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest,
etc. 

(16)
 Oil and gas producing activities. 

(i)
Oil and gas producing activities include: 

(A)
The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states
and original locations; 

(B)
The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas
from such properties; 

(C)
The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the
acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as: 

1 Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and 

2 Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and 

(D)
Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural
resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction. 

DEFINITIONS - 3 

(17)
 Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 

(i)
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved
plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total
quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. 

(ii)
Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available
data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly
the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. 

(iii)
Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than
the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. 

(iv)
The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical
and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results
in successful similar projects. 

(v)
Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the
same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological
discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication
with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area
if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 

(vi)
Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the
potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir
above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir
that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties
and pressure gradient interpretations. 

(18)
 Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves
but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

(i)
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated
proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities
recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. 

DEFINITIONS - 4 

(ii)
Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available
data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty
criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication
with the proved reservoir. 

(iii)
Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons
in place than assumed for proved reserves. 

(iv)
See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section. 

(19)
 Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values
that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of
possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. 

(20)
 Production costs. 

(i)
Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs
of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They
become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are: 

(A)
Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

(B)
Repairs and maintenance. 

(C)
Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

(D)
Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. 

(E)
Severance taxes. 

(ii)
Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining,
and marketing activities. To the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their
depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion,
and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the
cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. 

(21)
 Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. 

(22)
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience
and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from
known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the
operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

DEFINITIONS - 5 

(i)
The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: 

(A)
The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 

(B)
Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically
producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 

(ii)
In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen
in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable
certainty. 

(iii)
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated
gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or
performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

(iv)
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid
injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

(A)
Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole,
the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes
the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

(B)
The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

(v)
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price
shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual
arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

(23)
 Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves. 

DEFINITIONS - 6 

(24)
 Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities
will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered
will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and,
as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are
made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to
decrease. 

(25)
 Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has
been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation
being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

(26)
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible,
as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a
reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of
delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

Note
to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until
those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated
from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative
test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

(27)
 Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is
confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

(28)
 Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources
may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and
undiscovered accumulations. 

(29)
 Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of
service wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection,
observation, or injection for in-situ combustion. 

(30)
 Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining
to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production.
The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration.
Stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type 
if drilled in a known area. 

DEFINITIONS - 7 

(31)
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered
from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

(i)
Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of
production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility
at greater distances. 

(ii)
Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they
are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 

(iii)
Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection
or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same
reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing
reasonable certainty. 

(32)
 Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
