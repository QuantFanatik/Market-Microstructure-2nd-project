1. BUSINESS 

Bitech
Technologies Corporation (formerly, Spine Injury Solutions Inc.) (the Company , we or us was
incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. In connection with the Company s planned expansion of its business following
the completion of the acquisition of Bitech Mining Corporation, a Wyoming corporation Bitech Mining ), it filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2022 to change its corporate name to Bitech Technologies Corporation. 

Currently,
we have refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated
to providing a suite of green energy solutions with industry focus on green data centers, commercial and residential utility, EV
infrastructure, and other renewable energy initiatives. We plan to pursue these innovative energy technologies through research and
development, planned acquisitions of other green energy technologies and plans to become a grid-balancing operator using Battery
Energy Storage System (BESS) solutions and applying new green technologies in power plants as a technology enabler in the green
energy sector. While participating in the clean energy economy, we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology
innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments, provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and
implement or manufacture these innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological focuses on smart grids, Building
Energy Management System (BEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure. 

To accelerate growth of a planned intellectual property
(IP) portfolio through acquisition strategies, we plan to execute our Smart Acquisition Model depicted in the diagram below
with selected acquisitions of defensible technologies accompanied with visionary management teams who can demonstrate a common goal with
us in order to unlock the full potential with capital infusion, accelerate growth. To achieve our development plans, we plan to incubate
those acquired companies toward foreseeable plans for mergers and acquisitions, formation of global joint ventures, while facilitating
new market entry to today s fastest growing Southeast Asia region. With this acquisition model, we expect to build a valuable technology
portfolio of IP assets in various innovative green energy technologies, leveraging our network of global capital partners with low-cost
manufacturing capacity and oversea outsourcing technical talents from our niche sources in Vietnam. 

We plan to execute a Dual Growth Business Model 
as depicted in the diagram below encompassing (1) IP portfolio growth which includes technology licensing or technology acquisitions,
enhanced with our plans to carry out research and development for specific applications, and (2) sustainable revenue growth by executing
planned BESS acquisitions via joint ventures with capital partners to collect joint venture income from BESS operations or Vietnam-based
manufacturing partners which can manufacture products derived from our technology solutions.

In
light of these initiatives and other reasons noted below, the Company has, however, elected to discontinue its efforts to
commercialize the electric power generation and charging system (the Tesdison Technology it formerly licensed from
SuperGreen Energy Corporation SuperGreen pursuant to the Patent 
Technology Exclusive and Non-Exclusive License Agreement dated January 15, 2021, as amended, entered into between SuperGreen and the
Company s wholly owned subsidiary Bitech Mining Corporation Bitech Mining (the SuperGreen
License . The Company has determined that the Tesdison Technology was not functional nor was it
capable of being developed into a commercially viable product as had been represented to the Company by SuperGreen, its founder
Calvin Cao, and his brother Michael Cao, leading up to Bitech Mining entering into the SuperGreen License. In addition, the Company
will temporarily pause the further development of Intellisys-8, the Company s planned chipset and related software that had
been designed to reduce power consumption and heat in computer systems and accelerate their computational speed due to the currently
unfavorable market conditions within the cryptocurrency market. 

Acquisition
of Bitech Mining Corporation 

The
Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 (the Closing Date through a share exchange pursuant to a Share Exchange
Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, Bitech Mining, each of Bitech Mining s shareholders
(each, a Seller and collectively, the Sellers ), and Benjamin Tran, solely in his capacity as Sellers 
Representative Sellers Representative ). The transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement is hereinafter
referred to as the Share Exchange ). The Share Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will acquire from the Sellers,
an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining s Common Stock, par value 0.001 per share, representing 100 of the issued
and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining (collectively, the Bitech Mining Shares ). In consideration of the Bitech Mining
Shares, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company s newly authorized Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ). Each Bitech Mining Share shall be entitled
to receive 0.09543 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into 53.975685
shares (an aggregate of approximately 485,781,300) of the Company s Common Stock (the Company Common Stock upon
filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company s authorized common stock so that
there are a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized but unissued to permit a full conversion of all the Series
A Preferred Stock. Effective as of June 27, 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 485,781,168 shares of Company
Common Stock following the June 27, 2022 filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company s
authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate,
approximately 96 of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis. 

The
Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered
the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of
the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles,
the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical
financial results.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, to our knowledge, there are no legal
proceedings or regulatory actions material to us to which we are a party, or have been a party to, or of which any of our property is
or was the subject matter of, and no such proceedings or actions are known by us to be contemplated except as provided below: 

Due to the misrepresentations and
omissions of SuperGreen, Calvin C. Cao and Michael H. Cao, among other reasons, the Company filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court, Central District of California on February 2, 2023 against SuperGreen, Michael H. Cao, Linh T. Dao, Calvin C. Cao and
entities affiliated with them alleging fraud-concealment, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty-duty of good faith, breach of
fiduciary duty-undivided loyalty, conversion and violation of California Penal Code Sec. 496 (the Cao Lawsuit ). This
lawsuit seeks compensatory damages of at least 33.6 million, treble and punitive damages, imposition of a constructive trust over
the defendants assets, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, attorney s fees and such other relief as determined by the
court. 

Effective February 20, 2023, the
Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiary Bitech Mining Corporation entered into a Confidential Settlement, Mutual Release,
and Share Transfer Agreement (the C. Cao Settlement Agreement with Calvin Cao C. Cao and SuperGreen
Energy Corporation SuperGreen, together with C. Cao, the C. Cao Parties ). The C. Cao Settlement
Agreement settles as to the C. Cao Parties, the Cao Lawsuit. Pursuant to the C. Cao
Settlement Agreement, the C. Cao Parties terminated the Patent Technology Exclusive and Non-Exclusive License Agreement
between Bitech Mining Corporation and SuperGreen dated January 15, 2021 as amended on January 15, 2021 and on March 26, 2022 (the
 License Agreement and SuperGreen canceled 51,507,749 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per
share issued by the Company to SuperGreen pursuant to the License Agreement. In addition, the parties to the Settlement Agreement
agreed to a mutual general release of liabilities against each other, refrain from making any disparaging remarks about each other
and the Company s filing a dismissal with prejudice of the Cao Lawsuit as to the C. Cao Parties. The Settlement Agreement also
contains additional covenants, representations and warranties that are customary of litigation settlement agreements. The Company
intends to continue to pursue the Cao Lawsuit as to the remaining defendants in that case, namely Michael Cao, B B Investment
Holding, LLC B B Investment and Linh Dao. 

On March 6, 2023, Michael Cao and
Linh Dao filed, without an attorney, a pro se Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction. No hearing has been set for this motion.
On March 23, 2023, the Court entered a default against B B Investment for failing to appear or otherwise defend itself in the
case. B B Investment is an affiliate of Michael Cao. 

The Company intends to vigorously prosecute this case
and believes the basis for the motion to dismiss the case lack merit. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit, however. 

Litigation Assessment 

We have evaluated the foregoing Cao Lawsuit to assess the likelihood of
any unfavorable outcome and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential loss as it relates to the litigation. Based on this assessment
and estimate, which includes an understanding of our intention to vigorously prosecute the Cao Lawsuit, we believe that the potential
defenses of any of the remaining defendants lack merit, however, and we cannot predict the likelihood of any recoveries by any of our
claims against the remaining defendants. This assessment and estimate is based on the information available to management as of the date
of this Annual Report and involves a significant amount of management judgment, including the inherent difficulty associated with assessing
litigation matters in their early stages. As a result, the actual outcome or loss may differ materially from those envisioned by the current
assessment and estimate. Our failure to successfully prosecute, defend or settle the Cao Litigation with the remaining defendants could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability and could cause the market value of our common stock
to decline.

statements and certain forward-looking information as defined under applicable United States securities laws.
All statements, other than statements of historical fact, made by us that address activities, events or developments that we expect

Although
we believe that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance
should not be placed on the forward-looking statements, because no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Since

Overview
of the Business 

Currently, we have
refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated to providing
a suite of green energy solutions with industry focus on green data centers, commercial and residential utility, EV infrastructure, and
other renewable energy initiatives. We have been developing and evaluating the commercial viability of our Evirontek Integrated
Platform to resolve the exorbitantly high cost of electricity in several industries . We plan to pursue these innovative
energy technologies through research and development, planned acquisitions of other green energy technologies and plans to become a grid-balancing
operator using Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) solutions and applying new green technologies in power plants as a technology enabler
in the green energy sector. While participating in the clean energy economy, we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology
innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments, provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and implement
or manufacture these innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological focuses on smart grids, Building Energy Management
System (BEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure. 

To accelerate growth of a planned intellectual property
(IP) portfolio through acquisition strategies, we plan to execute our Smart Acquisition Model with selected acquisitions of defensible
technologies accompanied with visionary management teams who can demonstrate a common goal with us in order to unlock the full potential
with capital infusion, accelerate growth. To achieve our development plans, we plan to incubate those acquired companies toward foreseeable
plans for mergers and acquisitions, formation of global joint ventures, while facilitating new market entry to today s fastest growing
Southeast Asia region. With this acquisition model, we expect to build a valuable technology portfolio of IP assets in various innovative
green energy technologies, leveraging our network of global capital partners with low-cost manufacturing capacity and oversea outsourcing
technical talents from our niche sources in Vietnam. 

Further, we plan to execute a Dual Growth Business
Model as depicted in the diagram below encompassing (1) IP portfolio growth which includes technology licensing or technology acquisitions,
enhanced with our plans to carry out research and development for specific applications, and (2) sustainable revenue growth by executing
planned BESS acquisitions via joint ventures with capital partners to collect joint venture income from BESS operations or Vietnam-based
manufacturing partners which can manufacture products derived from our technology solutions. 

In
light of these initiatives and other reasons noted below, the Company has, however, elected to discontinue its efforts to commercialize
the electric power generation and charging system (the Tesdison Technology it licensed from SuperGreen pursuant to the
SuperGreen License. The Company has determined that the Tesdison Technology was not functional nor was it capable of being developed
into a commercially viable product as had been represented to the Company by SuperGreen, its founder Calvin Cao, and his brother Michael
Cao, leading up to Bitech Mining entering into the SuperGreen License. In addition, the Company will temporarily pause the further development
of Intellisys-8, the Company s planned chipset and related software that had been designed to reduce power consumption and heat
in computer systems and accelerate their computational speed due to the currently unfavorable market conditions within the cryptocurrency
market. 

The
Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 pursuant to a Share Exchange
Agreement. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement we acquired
an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining s Common Stock representing 100 of the issued
and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining in exchange for an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company s newly authorized Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 53.975685
shares (an aggregate of approximately 485,781,300) of the Company s Common Stock (the Company Common Stock upon
filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company s authorized common stock so that
there were a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized but unissued to permit a full conversion of all the Series
A Preferred Stock. Effective as of June 27, 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 485,781,168 shares of Company
Common Stock following the June 27, 2022 filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company s
authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate,
approximately 96 of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis. 

The
Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered
the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of
the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles,
the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical
financial results. 

The following agreements were entered into in connection
with the acquisition of Bitech Mining: 

Agreements involving Peter L. Dalrymple. On
March 31, 2022, the Company, Quad and Peter L. Dalrymple Dalrymple ), a former director of the Company, entered into the
MSA, Note Amendment and Security Agreement Amendment. See Item 1 - Business Acquisition of Bitech Mining Corporation. 

Disposition of Quad Video Assets. On June 30, 2022,
we completed the sale of the Quad Video Assets pursuant to the terms of the Quad Video APA and the sale of certain accounts receivables
related to our former spine pain management business pursuant to the terms of the SPIN Accounts Receivable APA. See Item 1 - Business
 Disposition of Quad Video Assets. 

Prior
to March 31, 2022, we were engaged in the business of owning, developing and leasing the Quad Video Halo video recording system QVH used to record medical procedures including the collection of accounts receivables related to previously provided spine injury diagnostic
services (collectively, the QVH Business ). On June 30, 2022, we sold the assets related to the QVH Business.

Comparison
of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The Company has not generated any revenues from its
primary business for the year ended December 31, 2022. We invoiced and collected 26,197 from QVH legacy business and recorded other income
of 50,275 generated from accounts receivable previously written-off as uncollectible for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was
no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred
 888,106 of general and administrative expenses compared to 284,959 for the same period in 2021. General and administrative expenses
have increased during 2022 compared to 2021 as the Company moves from development stage to revenue generation. 

As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of 811,635)
for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of 284,959) for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Working
Capital 

The
calculation of Working Capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. We define Working Capital as current assets
less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP.
This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity. 

Other
companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had total current liabilities of 11,397 and 11,106, respectively, and current assets
of 210,723 and 976,947, respectively, to meet our current obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of 199,326,
a decrease of working capital of 766,515 as compared to December 31, 2021, driven primarily by cash used in operations. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in
operations was 789,344) which primarily included the net loss of 811,635) partially offset by a 35,000 full amortization of exclusive
license agreement. 

We
have a history of operating losses. We have not yet achieved profitable operations and expect to incur further losses. We have
funded our operations primarily from equity financing. As of December 31, 2022, cash generated from financing activities was not
sufficient to fund our growth strategy in the short-term or long-term. The primary need for liquidity is to fund
working capital requirements of the business, including operational expenses in connection with our efforts to become a provider of
a suite of green energy solutions. The primary source of liquidity has primarily been private financing transactions. The ability to
fund operations and pursue opportunities within the green energy industry depends on our ability to raise funds from debt and/or
equity financing which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are
beyond our control. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that
it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely
to have, a current or future effect on our results of operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations
as liquidity and capital resources. 

Changes
in or Adoption of Accounting Practices 

There were no material changes in or adoption of new
accounting practices during the year ended December 31, 2022.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Bitech Technologies Corporation 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Bitech Technologies Corporation the Company as of December
31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for year then
ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

The
Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating
activities, therefore, the Company has stated that substantial doubt exists about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Going
Concern 

As
described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses each year from inception through
December 31, 2022 and expects to incur additional losses in the future. 

We
determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty
regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in estimating these
cash flows. 

Our
audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among
others: 

We
reviewed the Company s working capital and liquidity ratios and forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of
cash used in management s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from
the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual
results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, the Company s financing arrangements
in place as of the report date, market and industry factors and consideration of the Company s relationships with its financing
partners.

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

as of December
31, 2022. Presently, we are trying to limit all operating expenses as much as possible. If in the future we decide to increase our service
development, marketing efforts and/or brand building activities, we will need to increase our operating expenses and our general and administrative
functions to support such growth in operations. No such growth in operations is presently planned. We are also actively seeking a private
company with which to enter into a strategic business transaction, including without limitation a merger; however, we cannot predict the
ultimate outcome of our efforts. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to successfully merge with a financially viable
company, or our ability to obtain additional capital from borrowing and/or selling securities, as needed, to fund our operations. There
is no assurance that additional capital can be obtained or that it can be obtained on terms that are favorable to us and our existing
stockholders. Any expectation of future profitability is likely dependent upon our ability to successfully merge with another company,
of which there can be no assurances. 

We were not
involved in any procedures in 2022 and have no plans to do so in the future. The previous service revenues earned has resulted in longer
settlement times, which has created a slowdown in cash collections.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
and adequately designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that such information
was accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allowed for timely
decisions regarding disclosure. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

(i) 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
 assets; 

(ii) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements; and 

(iii) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized transactions. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller
Public Companies. 

Our
management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation,
our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation
by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls or
internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management s override
of the control. The design of any systems of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected. Individual persons perform multiple tasks which normally would be allocated to separate persons and therefore extra
diligence must be exercised during the period these tasks are combined.

Officer
and Board Qualifications 

Our
officers and board of directors are well qualified as leaders. In their prior positions they have gained experience in core management
skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development.
Our officers and directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies and private
companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends, which provides an understanding of different business
processes, challenges, and strategies. 

Number
and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

Our
board of directors is comprised of three directors. Each director is elected at our annual meeting of stockholders and holds office for
one year, or until his successor is elected and qualified. Our officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion
of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices
set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a President, Vice Presidents, Secretary,
Assistant Secretaries, Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees
of our Board of Directors 

Our
securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our board members be independent and we are not currently
otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our board of directors include independent 
directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our board of directors. 

The
board does not have standing audit, compensation or nominating committees. The board does not believe these committees are necessary
based on the size of our company, the current levels of compensation to our corporate officers and the ownership by our executive officers
and directors which gives them control over all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The board will consider establishing
audit, compensation and nominating committees and the appointment of independent directors at the appropriate time. 

The
entire board of directors participates in the consideration of compensation issues and of director nominees. Candidates for director
nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the board and our operating requirements and the long-term interests
of its stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the board of directors considers skills, diversity, age, and such other factors as
it deems appropriate given the current needs of the board and our company, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. 

The
board s process for identifying and evaluating nominees for director, including nominees recommended by stockholders, will involve
compiling names of potentially eligible candidates, conducting background and reference checks, conducting interviews with the candidate
and others (as schedules permit), meeting to consider and approve the final candidates and, as appropriate, preparing an analysis with
regard to particular recommended candidates. 

Board
Qualifications 

We
believe that each of the members of our board of directors has the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that make him suitable
to serve as our director, in light of the nature of our operations. See above under the heading Management for a description
of the education and experience of each director. 

Mr.
Tran s specific qualifications, experience, skills and expertise include: 

Core business skills, including
 financial and strategic planning; 

Finance expertise; and 

Operating and management
 experience.

Board
Leadership Structure and Board s Role in Risk Oversight 

Our
board is generally responsible for the oversight of corporate risk in its review and deliberations relating to our activities. Our principal
source of risk falls into two categories, financial and product commercialization. The board oversees management of financial risks;
and regularly reviews information regarding our cash position, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The
board regularly reviews plans, results and potential risks related to our business. The board is also expected to oversee risk management
as it relates to our compensation plans, policies and practices for all employees including executives and directors, particularly whether
our compensation programs may create incentives for our employees to take excessive or inappropriate risks which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own beneficially more than
ten percent of our common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC. Based solely upon a review of Forms
3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto filed electronically with the SEC during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we believe that the
directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners have complied with all applicable filing requirements during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 except as follows: Benjamin Tran filed a late Form 3 and one Form 4, Gregory Trimarche filed a late Form 3, Calvin
Cao file a late Form 3 and one Form 4, Michael Cao filed a late Form 3 and one Form 4 and Robert Brilon filed a late Form 3 and one late
Form 4. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our directors, principal executive officers, principal financial officers, principal
accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics for Directors and Executive Officers
can be found on our website at https://bitech.tech/investors-relations. Further, we
undertake to provide by mail to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of such code of ethics if we receive the request in
writing by mail to: Bitech Technologies Corporation, 895 Dove Street, Suite 300, Newport Beach, CA 92660. 

Audit
Committee 

We
maintain a separately-designated standing audit committee. The Audit Committee currently consists of Robert Brilon and Greg
Trimarche. Although the Charter of the Audit Committee provides for a majority of the Audit
Committee to be independent, presently only Mr. Trimarche is independent. 

Mr.
Brilon is the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the board of directors has determined that he is an audit committee financial expert
as defined in Item 5(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to oversee our accounting and financial reporting
processes and audits of our financial statements on behalf of the board of directors. The Audit Committee meets privately with our management
and with our independent registered public accounting firm and evaluates the responses by our management both to the facts presented
and to the judgments made by our outside independent registered public accounting firm.

Compensation
Policies and Practices as they Relate to Risk Management 

We
attempt to make our compensation programs discretionary, balanced and focused on the long term. We believe goals and objectives of our
compensation programs reflect a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative performance measures to avoid excessive weight on a single
performance measure. Our approach to compensation practices and policies applicable to employees and consultants is consistent with that
followed for its executives. Based on these factors, we believe that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that
are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The following table sets forth information, as of
December 31, 2022, concerning, except as indicated by the footnotes below, (i) each person whom we know beneficially owns more than 5 
of our common stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each of our named executive officers and (iv) all of our directors and executive
officers as a group. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes
below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and
investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.
Applicable percentage ownership is based on 515,505,770 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022. In computing the number
of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of
common stock subject to stock options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of
December 31, 2022. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person. Unless otherwise noted, stock options and warrants referenced in the footnotes below are currently fully vested and exercisable.

Related
Party Transactions 

A
related party transaction includes any transaction or proposed transaction in which: 

we are or will be a participant; 

the aggregate amount involved exceeds 120,000 in any
 fiscal year; and 

any related party has or will have a direct or indirect
 material interest. 

Related

that role) our executive officer or director, any shareholder owning more than 5 of any class of our voting securities or an immediate
family member of any such person. 

Any
potential related party transaction that requires approval will be reviewed and overseen by our board of directors, and the board of
directors will consider such factors as it deems appropriate to determine whether to approve, ratify or disapprove the related party
transaction. The board of directors may approve the related party transaction only if it determines in good faith that, under all of
the circumstances, the transaction is in the best interests of us and our shareholders. 

The following agreements were entered into in connection
with the acquisition of Bitech Mining: 

Agreements involving Peter L. Dalrymple. On

Director
Independence 

We
currently have one independent director on our board, Gregory D. Trimarche. The definition of independent used herein is
arbitrarily based on the independence standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The board performed a review to determine the independence
of Gregory D. Trimarche and made a subjective determination as to each of these directors that no transactions, relationships or arrangements
exist that, in the opinion of the board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director of the Company. In making these determinations, the board reviewed information provided by these directors
with regard to each individual s business and personal activities as they may relate to us and our management.
