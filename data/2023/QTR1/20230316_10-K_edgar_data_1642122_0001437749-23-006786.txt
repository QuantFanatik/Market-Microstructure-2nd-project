Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Our disclosure and analysis in this report and in documents that are incorporated by reference contain some forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You should not place undue reliance on these statements. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. 
 
 Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include, without limitation: the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance of our products; a general downturn in the economy; changes in government policy or regulation; changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees; and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations. We also direct your attention to any more specific discussions of risk contained in our other public filings or in documents incorporated by reference here or in prior filings or reports. 
 
 We are providing these statements as permitted by the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations or if we receive any additional information relating to the subject matters of our forward-looking statements.

PART 1: OVERVIEW 
 
 Giving Back to Society - (Y)our S in ESG 
 
 AC seeks to be a good corporate citizen by supporting our community through sponsoring local organizations. On November 11, 2022, the Board of Directors of AC approved a 0.15 per share shareholder designated charitable contribution SDCC for registered shareholders as of January 18, 2023. Based on the program created by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, our corporate charitable giving is somewhat unique in that the recipients of AC's charitable contributions are chosen directly by the shareholders, rather than our corporate officers. Since our spin off as a public company in 2015, the shareholders of AC have donated approximately 34 million, including 3.0 million for the most recent SDCC, to over 160 organizations (501(c)(3)) across the United States. 

ITEM 1: 
 BUSINESS 

(Y)our Business 
 
 We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 2015, that provides alternative investment management services and operates a direct investment business that over time invests in businesses that fit our criteria. Additionally, we derive income from proprietary investments. 
 
 Alternative Investment Management 
 
 We conduct our investment management activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary Gabelli Company Investment Advisers, Inc. GCIA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gabelli Partners, LLC Gabelli Partners ). GCIA is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). GCIA and Gabelli Partners together serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds including limited partnerships and offshore companies (collectively, Investment Partnerships ), and separate accounts. We primarily manage assets across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios and in equity event-driven value strategies. The business earns management and incentive fees from its advisory activities. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of assets under management AUM ). Incentive fees are based on a percentage of the investment returns of certain client portfolios. 
 
 We manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of U.S. and foreign securities mainly in the developed global markets. We primarily employ absolute return strategies with the objective of generating positive returns. We serve a wide variety of investors globally, including private wealth management clients, corporations, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, foundations and endowments, as well as serving as sub-advisor to certain third-party investment funds. 
 
 In merger arbitrage, the goal is to earn absolute positive returns. We introduced our first limited partnership, Gabelli Arbitrage (renamed Gabelli Associates Fund), in February 1985. Our typical investment process begins when a deal is announced, buying shares of the target at a discount to the stated deal terms, earning the spread until the deal closes, and reinvesting the proceeds in new deals in a similar manner. By owning a diversified portfolio of transactions, we mitigate the adverse impact of single deal-specific risks. Since inception, we have compounded net annual returns of 7.2 with 36 of 38 positive years, net, overall. As a result, a 10 million investment by a tax free vehicle in this fund at its inception would be worth more than 140 million as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the value of the investment would have exhibited significantly less volatility than that of broad equity indices. 
 
 As the business and investor base expanded, we launched an offshore version in 1989. Building on our strengths in global event-driven value investing, several investment vehicles have been added to balance investors geographic, strategic and sector-specific needs. Today, we manage investments in multiple categories, including merger arbitrage, event-driven value and other strategies. 
 
 In 2021, our Board of Directors approved the launch of a private equity fund.

Proprietary Capital 
 
 Proprietary capital is earmarked for our direct investment business that invests in new and existing businesses, using a variety of techniques and structures. We launched our direct private equity and merchant banking activities in August 2017. The direct investment business is developing along several core pillars: 

Gabelli Private Equity Partners, LLC GPEP ), formed in August 2017 with 150 million of authorized capital as a fund-less sponsor. 

Gabelli Principal Strategies Group, LLC GPS was created to pursue strategic operating initiatives broadly. 

Our direct investing efforts are organized to invest in various ways, including growth capital, leveraged buyouts and restructurings, with an emphasis on small and mid-sized companies. Our investment sourcing is across a variety of channels, including direct owners, private equity funds, classic agents, and corporate carve outs (which are positioned for accelerated growth, as businesses seek to enhance shareholder value through financial engineering). The Company s direct investing vehicles allow us to acquire companies and create long-term value with no pre-determined exit timetable. 
 
 We have a proprietary portfolio of cash and investments which we expect to use to invest primarily in funds that we will manage, provide seed capital for new products, expand our geographic presence, develop new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances.

Business Strategy 
 
 Our business strategy targets global growth of the business through continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths, including the long-term performance record of our alternative investment funds, diverse product offerings and experienced investment, research and client relationship professionals. In order to achieve performance and growth in AUM and profitability, we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements: 
 
 Continuing an Active Fundamental Investment Approach 
 
 Since 1985, our results demonstrate our core competence in absolute return, event driven investing through varying market cycles to earn rates of return independent of the broad markets direction. Our proprietary Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst investing approach remains the principal management philosophy guiding our global research efforts and forms the backbone of our M A investment activities. The PMV methodology is based on investing principles first articulated by Graham Dodd, and further refined by our Executive Chair, Mario J. Gabelli. Our M A portfolios provide access to Gabelli s deep history of investing in mergers and is a natural extension of our long standing research-driven investment process oriented toward undervalued assets as articulated through our PMV methodology. The investment team takes an active approach to merger investing, analyzing the various qualitative and quantitative aspects of the transaction from announcement to deal completion, coupled with our fundamental understanding of business valuations, building and monitoring transactions in the portfolio across the deal timeline. 
 
 Growing our Investment Partnerships Advisory Business 
 
 We intend to grow our Investment Partnerships advisory operations by gaining share with existing products and introducing new products within our core competencies, such as event and merger arbitrage. In addition, we intend to grow internationally. 
 
 Capitalizing on Acquisitions and Alliances - Direct Investments 
 
 We intend to leverage our research and investment capabilities by pursuing acquisitions and alliances that will broaden our product offerings and add new sources of distribution. In addition, we may make direct investments in operating businesses using a variety of techniques and structures. 
 
 Opportunities in Private Equity 
 
 One of our initiatives is to launch a private equity business to capitalize on the developing opportunities in the capital market place. 
 
 Pursuing Partnerships and Joint Ventures 
 
 We plan to pursue partnerships and joint ventures with firms that fit with AC s product quality and that can provide Asian/European distribution capabilities that would complement our U.S. equity product expertise. We expect to target opportunities for investors interested in non-market correlated returns. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The alternative asset management industry is intensely competitive. We face competition in all aspects of our business from other managers in the United States and around the globe. We compete with alternative investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives. Many of these investment management firms are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and may have access to greater resources than we do. Many are larger in terms of AUM and revenues and, accordingly, have larger investment and sales organizations and related budgets. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of the long-term investment performance of our investment products. We have recently taken steps to increase our distribution channels, brand awareness and marketing efforts. 
 
 The market for providing investment management services to institutional and private wealth management clients is also highly competitive. Selection of investment advisors by U.S. institutional investors is often subject to a screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry consultants. Many of these investors require their investment advisors to have a successful and sustained performance record, often five years or longer, and focus on one-year and three-year performance records. Currently, we believe that our investment performance record would be attractive to potential new institutional and private wealth management clients. While we have significantly increased our AUM from institutional investors since our founding, no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain new business will be successful.

Intellectual Property 
 
 Service marks and brand name recognition are important to our business. We have rights to the service marks under which our products are offered. We have rights to use the Gabelli name, and the GAMCO brand, pursuant to a non-exclusive, royalty-free license agreement we have entered into with GAMCO (the Service Mark and Name License Agreement ). We can use these names with respect to our funds, collective investment vehicles, Investment Partnerships and other investment products pursuant to the Service Mark and Name License Agreement. The Service Mark and Name License Agreement has a perpetual term, subject to termination only in the event we are not in compliance with its quality control provisions. Pursuant to an assignment agreement signed in 1999, Mario J. Gabelli had assigned to GAMCO all of his rights, title and interests in and to the Gabelli name for use in connection with investment management services and institutional research services. In addition, the funds managed by Mario J. Gabelli outside GAMCO and AC have entered into a license agreement with GAMCO permitting them to continue limited use of the Gabelli name under specified circumstances. 
 
 Regulation 
 
 Virtually all aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and investors and the financial markets. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisors have broad powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit such an advisor from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, injunctions, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of the investment advisor and other registrations, censures and fines. 
 
 Existing U.S. Regulation Overview 
 
 AC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the United States Department of Labor, and other regulatory bodies. Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to anti-terrorist financing, privacy, and anti-money laundering regulations, as well as economic sanctions laws and regulations established by these agencies. 
 
 The Advisers Act 
 
 GCIA is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and is regulated by and subject to examination by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record keeping, operational and marketing requirements. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser s registration. The failure of GCIA to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment advisory services under investment management agreements. Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements cannot be assigned without the client s consent. 
 
 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA 
 
 GCIA is subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as it is a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to certain of its clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Anti-Tax Evasion Legislation 
 
 Our global business may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act FATCA ), which was enacted in 2010 and introduced expansive new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring U.S. persons with financial assets outside of the United States pay appropriate taxes. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements IGAs between the United States and the countries in which we do business or have accounts. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has developed the Common Reporting Standard CRS to address the issue of offshore tax evasion on a global basis. Aimed at maximizing efficiency and reducing cost for financial institutions, the CRS provides a common standard for due diligence, reporting and exchange of information regarding financial accounts. Pursuant to the CRS, participating jurisdictions will obtain from reporting financial institutions, and automatically exchange with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis, financial information with respect to all reportable accounts identified by financial institutions on the basis of common due diligence and reporting procedures. As a result, the Investment Partnerships will be required to report information on the investors of the Partnerships to comply with the CRS due diligence and reporting requirements, as adopted by the countries in which the Investment Partnerships are organized. 
 
 The FATCA and CRS rules will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. Investment Partnerships and separately managed accounts and subject us to extensive additional administrative burdens. Our business could also be impacted to the extent there are other changes to tax laws, such as the recent tax reform legislation. Such changes could adversely affect our financial results.

Table of Contents 

The Patriot Act 
 
 The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates various regulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain some similar provisions. Our failure to comply with these requirements as applicable to us could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Laws and Other Issues Relating to Taking Significant Equity Stakes in Companies 
 
 Investments by AC, its affiliates, and those made on behalf of their respective advisory clients and Investment Partnerships often represent a significant equity ownership position in an issuer s equity. This may be due to the fact that AC is deemed to be a member of a group that includes GAMCO, an entity under common control with AC, and, therefore, may be deemed to beneficially own the securities owned by other members of the group under applicable securities regulations. As of December 31, 2022, by virtue of being a member of the group, AC was deemed to hold five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect to approximately 70 equity securities. This activity raises frequent regulatory, legal and disclosure issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect to portfolio securities, including issues relating to issuers stockholder rights plans or poison pills , various federal and state regulatory limitations, including (i) state gaming laws and regulations, (ii) federal communications laws and regulations, (iii) federal and state public utility laws and regulations, (iv) federal proxy rules governing stockholder communications, and (v) federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership positions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Potential Legislation Relating to Private Pools of Capital 
 
 We manage a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to: investor eligibility; trading activities, record-keeping and reporting; the scope of anti-fraud protections; safekeeping of client assets; tax treatment; and a variety of other matters. AC may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators. 
 
 Existing European Regulation Overview 
 
 Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 
 
 Our European activities are impacted by the European Union s EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD ). AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds AIFs domiciled within and, potentially, outside the EU. AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area. AIFMD s requirements restrict AIF marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations on AC regarding items such as remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, domicile of custodians and liquidity management. These compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements will subject us to additional expenses. 
 
 Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities 
 
 The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities UCITS impacting depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, seeks to align the depositary regime, remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under the UCITS Directive with the requirements of AIFMD. 
 
 Similarly, the European Securities and Markets Authority recently revised its guidelines for exchange-traded and other UCITS funds. These guidelines introduced new collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management EPM techniques (including securities lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. We are following the guidelines with respect to our collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of the UCITS funds for which GCIA acts as a sub-advisor. The costs of complying with increasing regulation in the EU may negatively impact the net performance of the UCITS fund that GCIA sub advises and therefore may result in decreased remuneration to GCIA for this sub advisory activity.

Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
 
 The EU s revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive MiFID II ), which was fully implemented in 2018, created specific new rules regarding the use of soft dollars to pay for research. A MiFID licensed investment firm that provides portfolio management services or independent investment advisory services to clients may not pay for third-party research with soft dollars generated through client trading activity. Research must be paid for either (i) by the investment firm out of its own resources, or (ii) through a separate research payment account for each client to pay for the research. While currently GCIA is not directly subject to MiFID II: (a) GCIA may be invoiced separately by any EU brokers from whom it purchases research in the future; and (b) clients may begin to require that GCIA unbundle research payments from commission trading. 
 
 The Financial Conduct Authority FCA currently regulates Gabelli Securities International (UK) Limited GSIL UK ), our MiFID licensed entity in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FCA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA s rules adopted under that Act provide requirements dealing with a firm s capital resources, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. The FCA supervises GSIL UK through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic-based reviews in order to monitor our compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against GSIL UK and/or its employees. 
 
 Clients whose assets we manage in the EU are additionally subject to EU regulations on OTC derivatives which require (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts. 
 
 Brexit Impact 
 
 Through The European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018, GSIL UK remained subject to the requirements of MiFID II as in effect on December 31, 2020 (the Transition End Date ). MiFID II sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. MiFID II also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms set out in the Capital Requirements Directive. This directive includes requirements not only on capital, but also governance and remuneration as well. The obligations introduced through these directives have a direct effect on some of our European operations. The Company cannot assure you the extent to which the future amendments to or replacement of MiFID II or other EU regulations will be adopted into UK law and continue to apply to GSIL UK after the Transition End Date. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Generally 
 
 The investment management industry is likely to continue to face a high level of regulatory scrutiny and to become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries which request information from investment advisors regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws. We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business. Changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material adverse impact. Although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist us in adhering to regulatory guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed, or the insurance that we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses, will protect us from all potential liabilities. 
 
 Employees 
 
 On March 3, 2023, we had a full-time staff of 24 teammates, of whom 8 served in the portfolio management, research and trading areas, 8 served in the marketing and shareholder servicing areas and 8 served in the finance, legal, operations and administrative areas. We also avail ourselves of services provided by GAMCO in accordance with a transitional services agreement that was entered into with GAMCO as part of AC s spin-off from GAMCO on November 30, 2015.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MD A OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
 
 Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE: AC), a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, provides alternative investment management services and operates a direct investment business. Our revenues are based primarily on the Company s level of assets under management AUM ). 
 
 In response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, economic sanctions were imposed on individuals and entities within Russia by governments around the world, including the U.S. and the European Union. Furthermore, a novel strain of coronavirus, and its variants ("COVID-19"), continue to disrupt global supply chains, adding broad inflationary pressures impacting companies worldwide. As a result of this pandemic, many of our employees ("teammates") were working remotely in early 2021. The Company's remote work arrangements were mostly discontinued as of July 2021 and a majority of our teammates are now back in our offices. The resulting economic dislocations from the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict did not have a significant adverse impact on our AUM. 
 
 There was no material impact of remote work arrangements on our operations, including our financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures, and there was no material challenge in implementing our business continuity plan.

Consolidated Statements of Income 
 
 Investment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our funds and accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. Growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and attracts additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. In light of the ongoing dynamics created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19, and their impact on the global economy and markets, we could experience higher volatility in short-term returns of our funds. 
 
 Incentive fees generally consist of an incentive allocation on the absolute gain in a portfolio generally equating to 20 of the economic profit, as defined in the agreements governing the investment vehicle or account. We recognize such revenue only when the measurement period has been completed or at the time of an investor redemption. 
 
 Compensation includes variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation is paid to sales personnel and portfolio management and may represent up to approximately 55 of revenues. 
 
 Management fee expense is incentive-based equal to 10 of adjusted aggregate pre-tax profits paid to the Executive Chair or his designees for his services pursuant to an employment agreement. 
 
 Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs. 
 
 Other income and expense includes net gains and losses from investments (which include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from securities and equity in earnings of investments in partnerships), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments and from consolidated investment funds. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to third-party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Notes 1 and 5 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition 
 
 We ended 2022 with approximately 873.9 million in cash and investments, net of securities sold, not yet purchased of 2.9 million. This includes 218.5 million of cash and cash equivalents; 186.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury obligations; 192.7 million of securities, net of securities sold, not yet purchased, including shares of GAMCO with a market value of 36.7 million; and 276.7 million invested in affiliated and third-party funds and partnerships, including investments in closed end funds managed by affiliates (primarily GAMCO) which have a value of 56.8 million and more limited liquidity. Our financial resources provide flexibility to pursue strategic objectives that may include acquisitions, lift-outs, seeding new investment strategies, and co-investing, as well as shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
 
 Total equity attributable to shareholders of the Company was 890.2 million or 40.48 per share as of December 31, 2022, compared to 937.1 million or 42.48 per share as of the prior year-end. Shareholders equity per share is calculated by dividing the total Associated Capital Group, Inc. equity by the number of common shares outstanding.

Investment advisory and incentive fees : We earn advisory fees based on our AUM. Investment advisory fees are directly influenced by the amount of average AUM and the fee rates applicable to various accounts. 
 
 Advisory and incentive fees were 14.8 million for 2022 compared to 20.5 million for 2021, a decrease of 5.7 million. This decrease is the result of lower performance-based incentive fees, partially offset by higher management fees based on higher average AUM in 2022. 
 
 Incentive fees are directly related to the gains generated for our clients accounts. We earn a percentage, usually 20 , of such gains. Incentive fees were 5.1 million in 2022, down 7.3 million from 12.4 million in 2021, due to superior investment performance in 2021. 
 
 Other revenues : Other revenues were 0.4 million in 2022 and 0.4 million in 2021. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Compensation : Compensation, which includes variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, was 18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 5.6 million from 24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fixed compensation expense, which includes salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, increased to 11.5 million in 2022 from 11.1 million in 2021. The remainder of compensation expense represents variable compensation that fluctuates with management and incentive fee revenues as well as the investment results of certain proprietary accounts. Variable payouts are also impacted by the mix of products upon which performance fees are earned and the extent to which they may exceed their allocated costs. For 2022, these variable payouts (based on the investment performance of the products with incentive fees) were 7.4 million, a decrease of 6.0 million from 13.4 million in 2021. 
 
 Management fees : Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation equal to 10 of the aggregate adjusted pre-tax profits, which is paid to the Executive Chair or his designees pursuant to his employment agreement with AC. In 2022 AC recorded no management fee expense due to pre-tax losses compared to management fee expense of 8.4 million in 2021. 
 
 Other operating expenses : Our other operating expenses were 7.6 million in 2022 compared to 7.1 million in 2021.

Investment and other non-operating income/(expense), net 
 
 Net gain/(loss) from investments : Net gain/(loss) from investments is directly related to the performance of our proprietary portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net losses from investments were 56.5 million compared to gains of 93.4 million in 2021. In 2022, market volatility brought on by rising interest rates, geo-political factors, and accelerating inflation impacted AC's investments, other than investments in merger arbitrage funds, on a mark-to-market basis. 
 
 Interest and dividend income : Interest and dividend income decreased to 10.7 million in 2022 from 12.1 million in 2021, primarily due to the 5.1 million 2 per share) special dividend declared on our holdings of GAMCO in 2021, partially offset by higher interest income on our investments in treasury bills as a result of higher nominal interest rates in 2022. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In 2022, we recorded an income tax benefit of 14.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate ETR of 24.7 . In 2021, we recorded income tax expense of 17.7 million resulting in an ETR of 21.8 . The increase in rate from 2021 is primarily driven by foreign investments and foreign income, which increased the 2022 rate by approximately 0.9 and decreased the 2021 rate by approximately 1.2 . 
 
 Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 3.4 million in 2022 compared to 4.4 million in 2021. The decrease of 1.0 million was driven primarily by the deconsolidation of Consolidated PMV (as defined in Note 1) in Q3 2022 and the Gabelli Merger Plus+ Trust tender offer in Q3 2022. 
 
 Net Income/(Loss) 
 
 Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 48.9 million compared to net income of 59.2 million for the prior year. The change was primarily driven by market uncertainty in 2022, which impacted AC's investments, other than our investments in merger arbitrage funds, on a mark-to-market basis. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our principal assets consist of cash and cash equivalents; short-term treasury securities; marketable securities, primarily equities, including 2.4 million shares of GAMCO; and interests in affiliated and third-party funds and partnerships. Although Investment Partnerships may be subject to restrictions as to the timing of distributions, the underlying investments of such Investment Partnerships are generally liquid, and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity.

We require relatively low levels of capital expenditures and have a highly variable cost structure where costs increase and decrease based on the level of revenues we receive. Our revenues, in turn, are highly correlated to the level of AUM and to investment performance. We anticipate that our available liquid assets should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements as we build out our operating business. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 218.5 million, investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of 186.0 million and 192.7 million of investments, net of securities sold, not yet purchased of 2.9 million. Included in cash and cash equivalents are 8.5 million and 4.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were held by consolidated investment funds and may not be readily available for the Company to access. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 70.6 million in 2022 due to 89.4 million of net increases driven by increases of securities less net distributions from investment partnerships and our net loss of 45.5 million, partially offset by 43.6 million of adjustments for noncash items, primarily unrealized losses on investment securities and partnership investments and deferred taxes, and 20.7 million in net receivables/payables.

Net cash provided by operating activities was 238.2 million in 2021 due to 278.1 million of net decreases of securities and net contributions to investment partnerships and our net income of 63.6 million, offset by 82.9 million of adjustments for noncash items, primarily gains on investments securities and partnership investments and deferred taxes, and 20.6 million in net receivables/payables. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 0.4 million in 2022 due to proceeds from maturities of debt securities held to maturity of 5.1 million, proceeds from sales of securities of 2.9 million, return of capital on securities of 2.3 million, partially offset by purchases of securities of 8.5 million and the impact of deconsolidation of our subsidiary of 1.4 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 65.3 million in 2021 due to proceeds from sales of securities of 35.3 million and return of capital on securities of 38.7 million, partially offset by purchases of securities of 8.7 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 37.2 million in 2022 resulting from redemptions of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 30.2 million, dividends paid of 4.4 million and stock buyback payments of 2.6 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 14.4 million in 2021 resulting from stock buyback payments of 7.6 million, dividends paid of 4.4 million and redemptions of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 2.3 million. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). We base our estimates on historical experience, when available, and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 
 We believe that the following critical accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment: 
 
 Major Revenue-Generating Services and Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company s revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory and incentive fees. 
 
 Investment advisory and incentive fees are directly influenced by the level and mix of AUM as fees are derived from a contractually-determined percentage of the balance of each account, as well as a percentage of the investment performance of certain accounts. Management fees from Investment Partnerships and offshore funds are computed either monthly or quarterly, and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These revenues vary depending upon the level of capital flows, financial market conditions, investment performance and the fee rates applicable to each account. 
 
 Incentive allocations or fees are generally recognized at the end of an annual measurement period and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 
 See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Investments in Securities 
 
 Investments in securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Securities transactions and any related gains and losses are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on the specific identified cost basis and are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. 

16

Table of Contents 

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. Government debt with maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase are considered investments in debt securities. The Company has investments in debt securities accounted for as trading, including investments in marketable securities held in trust by PMV in 2021 and prior to the deconsolidation of Consolidated PMV in August 2022. 
 
 Securities sold, but not yet purchased are recorded on the trade date, and are stated at fair value and represent obligations of AC to purchase the securities at prevailing market prices. Therefore, the future satisfaction of such obligations may be for an amount greater or less than the amounts recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate gains or losses recognized are dependent upon the prices at which these securities are purchased to settle the obligations under the sales commitments. Unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses from covers of securities sold, not yet purchased transactions are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Consolidation 
 
 The Company assesses all entities with which it is involved for consolidation on a case by case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. Pursuant to the accounting guidance, the Company first evaluates whether it holds a variable interest in an entity. The Company considers all economic interests, including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if such interests are to be considered a variable interest. Fees paid to the Company that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided from entities in which the Company does not hold other economic interests in the entity are not considered as a variable interest. 
 
 For any entity in which the Company has determined that it does hold a variable interest, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether it qualifies as a variable interest entity VIE ). A VIE is an entity in which either the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. 
 
 The granting of substantive kick-out rights is a key consideration in determining whether a limited partnership or similar entity is a VIE and whether or not that entity should be consolidated. The Company evaluates consolidation on a case by case basis for those VIEs in which substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the unaffiliated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner. 
 
 Under the variable interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities where it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary when it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, which is defined as possessing both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If the Company alone is not considered to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE but the Company and its related parties under common control in the aggregate have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, the Company will be deemed to be the primary beneficiary if it is the party that is most closely associated with the VIE. When the Company and its related parties not under common control in the aggregate have a controlling financial interest in a VIE, the Company would be deemed to be the primary beneficiary if substantially all the activities of the entity are performed on behalf of the Company. 
 
 The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes initially involved with the VIE and reconsiders that conclusion as required. Investments and redemptions (either by the Company, related parties of the Company or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entity may affect an entity s status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. 
 
 Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities VOEs under the voting interest model. The Company evaluates whether the entity should be evaluated under the guidance for partnerships and similar entities, or corporations, and consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest or other means. If the Company is the general partner or managing member it generally will not be required to consolidate a VOE. 
 
 The Company records noncontrolling interests in consolidated Investment Partnerships for which the Company s ownership is less than 100 . 
 
 See Note 5, Investment Partnerships and Other Entities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Investments in Partnerships and Affiliates 
 
 The Company is general partner or co-general partner of various managed funds. We also have investments in unaffiliated partnerships, offshore funds and other entities (collectively, investments in partnerships and affiliates ). The Company accounts for its investments in partnerships and affiliates under the equity method. Substantially all of the Company s equity method investees are entities that record their underlying investments at fair value and are included in investments in partnerships in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, the Company s share of the investee s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. The Company s share of the investee s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Capital contributions are recorded as an increase in investments when payable, and withdrawals and distributions are recorded as reductions of the investments when receivable. Depending on the terms of the investment, the Company may be restricted as to the timing and amounts of withdrawals.

Income Taxes 
 
 For purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. To the extent uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions and penalties in the income tax provision on the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 
 See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Developments, in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Seasonality and Inflation 
 
 We do not believe that our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs, as they are substantially variable in nature. The rate of inflation may affect certain other expenses, however, such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our AUM, revenues or otherwise.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Associated Capital Group, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Associated Capital Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communiacted below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Deconsolidation of PMV Consumer Acquisition Corp - Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 5 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company assesses all entities with which it is involved for consolidation on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. Pursuant to the accounting guidance, the Company first evaluates whether it holds a variable interest in an entity. The Company considers all economic interests, including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if such interests are variable interests. For any entity where the Company has determined that it does hold a variable interest, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether it qualifies as a variable interest entity VIE ). Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities VOEs under the voting interest model. The Company evaluates whether the entity should be evaluated under the guidance for partnerships and similar entities, or corporations, and consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest or other means. 
 
 PMV Consumer Acquisition Corp. PMV , or PMV SPAC ), a special purpose acquisition corporation, and its sponsor, PMV Consumer Acquisition Holding Company, LLC ("Sponsor", collectively "Consolidated PMV") were previously consolidated in the financial statements of the Company because the Company had a controlling financial interest in these entities through the Company s 100 ownership of the manager of the Sponsor. Commencing in August 2022, as a result of management and organizational restructuring negotiations at the Sponsor to extend the life of PMV, the Company no longer controlled the manager of the Sponsor and thus no longer controlled Consolidated PMV. As a result, Consolidated PMV was deconsolidated from the financial statements. 
 
 We identified the deconsolidation of Consolidated PMV, as a Critical Audit Matter because of the significant judgement involved in the application of the consolidation accounting principles in Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). The judgement was related to whether the Company continued to have substantive control of Consolidated PMV. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit: 
 
 1. We evaluated management s consolidation analysis, including their conclusion that the Company no longer has a controlling financial interest in Consolidated PMV. 
 
 2. We considered whether management s conclusions were supported by transaction documents and other relevant facts. 
 
 3. We involved senior, more experienced audit team members to perform audit procedures. 
 
 4. We evaluated the financial statement impact and related disclosures associated with the deconsolidation of these entities. 

/s/ 

March 15, 2023 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

 For 2022, the Company deconsolidated certain subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of 176.9 million of assets, 7.4 million of liabilities and 165.0 million of Redeemable noncontrolling interests. The deconsolidated assets are almost entirely attributable to 175.4 million of Investments in marketable securities held in trust and 1.5 million of cash held by Consolidated PMV (as defined in Note 1), the latter of which is reflected as an Investing outflow. The deconsolidated liabilities are almost entirely attributable to 6.1 million Deferred underwriting fee payable, and 0.9 million of PMV warrant liability. As a result of deconsolidation, 9.9 million of Investments in securities and 1.0 million of Investments in partnerships, which were previously eliminated in consolidation, were recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition (see Note 5).

ownership of the manager of the Sponsor. Commencing in August 2022, as a result of management and organizational restructuring negotiations at the Sponsor to extend the life of PMV, AC no longer controlled the manager of the Sponsor and thus no longer controlled Consolidated PMV. As a result, Consolidated PMV was deconsolidated from the financial statements in August 2022. 
 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Consolidated PMV entity resulted in the consolidation of million of assets, million of liabilities, million of redeemable noncontrolling interests and million of noncontrolling interests. There are several other entities that are consolidated within the financial statements for both 2022 and 2021. The details on the impact of consolidating these entities on the consolidated financial statements can be seen in Note 5. Investment Partnerships and Other Entities .

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 
 The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the instrument. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. 
 
 In the absence of a closing price, an average of the bid and ask price is used. Bid prices reflect the highest price that market participants are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that market participants are willing to accept for an asset. 
 
 Cash equivalents Cash equivalents primarily consist of short-term Treasury Bills and an affiliated money market mutual fund which is invested solely in U.S. Treasury securities and valued based on the net asset value of the fund. Other cash equivalents are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices. Accordingly, cash equivalents are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Investments in securities Investments in securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are generally valued based on quoted prices from an exchange or an active dealer market. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied, and they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Securities categorized as Level 2 investments are valued using other observable inputs. Nonpublic and infrequently traded investments are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because significant inputs to measure fair value are unobservable. 
 
 Investment in note receivable from affiliate Investment in note receivable from affiliate is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, however fair value is estimated based on observed market inputs for similar instruments and therefore is classified as Level 2. 
 
 PMV warrant liability PMV warrant liability was valued based on quoted prices from an exchange and is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Consolidation 
 
 The Company assesses all entities with which it is involved for consolidation on a case by case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. Pursuant to the accounting guidance, the Company first evaluates whether it holds a variable interest in an entity. The Company considers all economic interests, including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if such interests are considered a variable interest. Fees paid to the Company that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided from entities in which the Company does not hold more than an insignificant economic interest are not considered as a variable interest. 
 
 For any entity in which the Company has determined that it does hold a variable interest, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether it qualifies as a variable interest entity VIE ). A VIE is an entity in which either the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The granting of substantive kick-out or participating rights is a key consideration in determining whether a limited partnership or similar entity is a VIE and whether or not that entity should be consolidated. The Company evaluates for consolidation on a case by case basis those entities in which substantive kick-out or participating rights have been granted to the unaffiliated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner. 
 
 Under the variable interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities where it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary when it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, which is defined as possessing both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When the Company alone is not considered to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE but the Company and its related parties under common control in the aggregate have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, the Company will be deemed the primary beneficiary if it is the party that is most closely associated with the VIE. When the Company and its related parties not under common control in the aggregate have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, the Company would be deemed to be the primary beneficiary if substantially all the activities of the entity are performed on behalf of the Company. 
 
 The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes initially involved with the VIE and reconsiders that conclusion as required. Investments and redemptions (either by the Company, related parties or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entity may affect an entity s status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. 
 
 Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities VOEs under the voting interest model. The Company evaluates whether the entity should be evaluated under the guidance for partnerships and similar entities, or corporations, and consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest or other means. If the Company is the general partner or managing member it generally will not be required to consolidate a VOE. 
 
 The Company records noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for which the Company s ownership is less than 100 . Refer to Noncontrolling Interests below for additional information. 

- per annum. Asset-based management fee revenue is recognized only as the services are performed over the period. 

b) Performance-based advisory fees Certain client contracts call for additional fees and or allocations of income tied to a certain percentage, generally - , of the investment performance of the account over a measurement period, typically the calendar year. In addition, the contracts provide that performance-based fees or allocations become fixed in the event of an investor redemption prior to the end of the measurement period. In the event that an account suffers a loss in one period, it must be recovered before incentive fees are earned by the Company; this is commonly referred to as a high water mark provision. While the Company s performance obligation is satisfied over time, the Company does not recognize performance-based fees until the end of the measurement period or the time of the investor redemption when the uncertainty surrounding the amount of the variable consideration is resolved. 

c) Sub-advisory fees Pursuant to agreements with other investment advisors, the Company receives a percentage of advisory fees received by such advisors from certain of their investment fund clients. These fees may be either asset- or performance-based. In addition, they may be subject to reduction by certain expenses as set forth in the respective agreements. Sub-advisory fee revenue which is asset-based is recognized ratably as the services are performed over the relevant contractual performance period. Sub-advisory fee revenue which is performance-based is recognized only when it becomes fixed and not subject to adjustment. Amounts receivable are included in receivable and investment in note receivable from affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The Company reserves the right to waive or reduce asset-based and performance-based fees with respect to certain investors in the investment funds, which may include investments by employees and other related parties. Advisory and incentive fees payable by investment funds are typically approved by third -party administrators and paid directly from the accounts assets. Such fees attributable to separate accounts may be subject to review and approval by the client and may be paid either from the accounts assets or directly by the client. 
 
 Our advisory fee revenues are influenced by both the amount of AUM and the investment performance of our products. An overall decline in the prices of securities may cause our advisory fees to decline by either causing the value of our AUM to decrease or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk. Similarly, success in the investment management business is dependent on investment performance as well as distribution and client services. Good performance can stimulate sales of our investment products and tends to keep withdrawals and redemptions low, which generates higher asset-based management fees. Conversely, poor performance, both in absolute terms and/or relative to peers and industry benchmarks, tends to result in decreased sales, increased withdrawals and redemptions and in the loss of clients, with corresponding decreases in revenues to us.

 The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.

PMV Consumer Acquisition Corp. 
 
 Commencing in August 2022, as a result of management and organizational restructuring negotiations at the Sponsor to extend the life of PMV, AC no longer controlled Consolidated PMV. As a result, Consolidated PMV was deconsolidated from the financial statements and a loss of million was recognized and recorded in Net gain/(loss) from investments in the consolidated statements of income. The loss represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of our remaining interest as of the transaction date. 
 
 We accounted for our remaining interest in PMV (comprising million shares of Class A common stock and PMV Public Warrants) at fair value. The initial fair value of these investments was million based on the respective closing prices of both instruments on the transaction date. Our investments in Class A common stock and PMV Public Warrants were recorded in Investments in equity securities in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and related earnings or loss from subsequent changes in fair value recognized in Net gain/(loss) from investments in the consolidated statements of income.

 In 2021 and prior to August 2022, AC consolidated the assets, liabilities and the results of operations of both PMV and Sponsor. AC invested million, or approximately of the million total Sponsor partnership commitment. The Sponsor was managed primarily by AC executives. AC determined that the Sponsor was a variable interest entity (VIE) and that AC was the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidated the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the Sponsor. In addition, AC has determined that PMV is a VIE due to the lack of equity at risk and therefore was consolidated by the Sponsor, who was deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Neither AC nor PMV had a right to the benefits from nor did it bear the risks associated with the marketable securities held in trust assets held by PMV.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported to management within the time periods specified in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Financial Officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our current management, including our CEO and co-CFOs, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act and based upon the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO framework )). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. An effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. 
 
 Based on its evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
