 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Citizens Northern Corporation Corporation is a holding company whose principal activity is community banking. The Corporation s principal office is located in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. The largest subsidiary is Citizens Northern Bank C N Bank or the Bank ). The Corporation s other wholly-owned subsidiaries are Citizens Northern Investment Corporation and Bucktail Life Insurance Company Bucktail ). Citizens Northern Investment Corporation was formed in 1999 to engage in investment activities. Bucktail reinsures credit and mortgage life and accident and health insurance on behalf of C N Bank. Over the past few years, the Corporation has been employing a growth strategy. Prior to 2019, substantially all of the Corporation s operations were conducted in its legacy markets in the Northern tier/Northcentral region of Pennsylvania and Southern tier of New York. Subsequently, the Corporation has expanded into Southeastern Pennsylvania by acquisitions and Southcentral Pennsylvania by opening new branches. The Corporation acquired Covenant Financial, Inc. Covenant ), effective July 1, 2020. Covenant was the parent company of Covenant Bank, a commercial bank which operated a community bank office in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and another in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The Covenant acquisition followed the 2019 acquisition of Monument Bancorp, Inc. Monument ), a commercial bank with offices in Bucks County. In Southcentral Pennsylvania, in 2021, the Corporation converted the lending office in York, Pennsylvania to a full-service branch and established a new branch in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mainly as a result of the acquisitions and subsequent growth in the newer markets, the Corporation s consolidated total assets at December 31, 2022 of 2.5 billion were up 90 from the corresponding total at December 31, 2018. Similarly, gross loans of 1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 were up 110 from December 31, 2018 and total deposits of 2.0 billion were up 93 from December 31, 2018. C N Bank is a Pennsylvania banking institution that was formed by the consolidation of Northern National Bank of Wellsboro and Citizens National Bank of Towanda in 1971. C N Bank has held its current name since May 6, 1975, at which time C N Bank changed its charter from a national bank to a Pennsylvania bank. The Bank has expanded its presence over the past several decades through a series of mergers as well as by opening new branch and lending offices and providing access to banking services via the internet and through ATMs. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 29 branch offices, including 22 in the Northern tier/Northcentral region of Pennsylvania, 1 in the Southern tier of New York State, 4 in Southeastern Pennsylvania (3 in Bucks County and 1 in Chester County) and 2 in Southcentral Pennsylvania (York and Lancaster). In addition to its branch locations, the Bank has a lending office in Elmira, New York. C N Bank provides an extensive range of banking services, including deposit and loan products for personal and commercial customers. The Bank also provides wealth management services through its trust department and C N Financial Services, LLC CNFS ). The trust department offers a wide range of financial services, such as 401(k) plans, retirement planning, estate planning, estate settlements and asset management. CNFS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, is a licensed insurance agency that provides insurance products to individuals and businesses and through its broker-dealer division, offers mutual funds, annuities, educational savings accounts and other investment products through registered agents. CNFS s operations are not significant in relation to the total operations of the Corporation. Northern Tier Holding LLC, acquires, holds and disposes of real property acquired by the Bank. C N Bank is the sole member of Northern Tier Holding LLC. All phases of the Bank s business are competitive. The Bank competes with online financial institutions, local commercial banks headquartered in our market areas and other commercial banks with branches in our market area. Many of the online financial institutions and some of the banks that have branches in our market areas are larger in overall size. With respect to lending activities and attracting deposits, the Bank also competes with savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, regulated small loan companies and credit unions. Also, the Bank competes with mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles for deposits. C N Bank competes with insurance companies, investment counseling firms, mutual funds and other business firms and individuals for trust, investment management, brokerage and insurance services. The Bank is generally competitive with all financial institutions in our service areas with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans. The Bank serves a diverse customer base and is not economically dependent on any small group of customers or on any individual industry.

 At December 31, 2022, C N Bank had total assets of 2,439,371,000, total deposits of 2,016,666,000 and net loans outstanding of 1,723,425,000. Most activities of the Corporation and its subsidiaries are regulated by federal or state agencies. The primary regulatory relationships are described as follows: The Corporation is a bank holding company formed under the provisions of Section 3 of the Federal Reserve Act. The Corporation is under the direct supervision of the Federal Reserve and must comply with the reporting requirements of the Federal Bank Holding Company Act. C N Bank is a state-chartered, nonmember bank, supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Pennsylvania Department of Insurance regulates CNFS s insurance activities. Brokerage products are offered through third party networking agreements. Bucktail is incorporated in the state of Arizona and supervised by the Arizona Department of Insurance.

We believe keeping our team well informed, connected, and appreciated adds to the success of our organization. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Corporation is subject to the many risks and uncertainties applicable to all banking companies, as well as risks specific to the Corporation s geographic locations. Although the Corporation seeks to effectively manage risks, and maintains a level of equity that exceeds the banking regulatory agencies thresholds for being considered well capitalized (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements), management cannot predict the future and cannot eliminate the possibility of credit, operational or other losses. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from management s expectations. Some of the Corporation s significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below. Risk Related to Acquisition Activity As described in Item 1, the Corporation has completed acquisitions of banking companies in 2020 and 2019 (Covenant and Monument) and expanded its geographic footprint to Southeastern and Southcentral Pennsylvania. Further, management intends to continue to pursue additional acquisition opportunities. Potential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation s business and dilute shareholder value. We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial service companies. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to the Corporation s business, potential diversion of management s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Corporation s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition or results of operations. Credit Risk from Lending Activities - A significant source of risk is the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most of the Corporation s loans are secured, but some loans are unsecured. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans. Collateral values may be adversely affected by changes in economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, wide-spread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events.

 In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards may create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when it is not. The Corporation has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and policies, including regular reviews of appraisals and borrower financial statements, that management believes are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss. Also, as discussed further in the Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses section of Management s Discussion and Analysis, the Corporation attempts to estimate the amount of losses that may be inherent in the portfolio through a quarterly evaluation process that includes several members of management and that addresses specifically identified problem loans, as well as other quantitative data and qualitative factors. Such risk management and accounting policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Interest Rate Risk - Business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a banking organization. The Corporation s assets are predominantly long-term, fixed-rate loans and debt securities. Funding for these assets comes principally from deposits with no stated maturities, term deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the Corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change. Moreover, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate in 2020 and maintained a rate of 0 to 0.25 throughout 2021 while injecting massive amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system. In 2022, the Federal Reserve changed course, raising the Federal Funds rate several times to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 at December 31, 2022 and then to 4.50 to 4.75 on February 1, 2023. The Federal Reserve s rate increases, along with an accompanying tightening of the money supply, have been conducted in an effort to contain inflation. Significant fluctuations in interest rates, including fluctuations in interest rates triggered by the Federal Reserve s actions, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Limited Geographic Diversification - The Corporation grants commercial, residential and personal loans to customers primarily in the Corporation s legacy markets of the Northern tier/Northcentral regions of Pennsylvania and Southern tier of New York and in Southeastern and Southcentral Pennsylvania. Although the Corporation has a diversified loan portfolio, a significant portion of its debtors ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the local economic conditions within these regions. Deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Competition - All phases of the Corporation s business are competitive. Some competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization than the Corporation, have greater access to capital markets and can offer a broader array of financial services. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Inability to Attract and Develop Qualified Personnel The Corporation believes that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, lending, financial, technological, marketing, sales, and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. For example, legislation and bank regulatory action that places restrictions on executive compensation at, and the pay practices of, financial institutions may further impact our ability to compete for talent with other industries that are not subject to the same limitations as financial institutions. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Cyber Security Risks and Technology Dependence In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and our business strategy. The Corporation has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect our networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access, and maintains an information security risk insurance policy. On an 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 on-going basis the Corporation assesses its cyber security procedures and controls and performs network penetration tests on at least an annual basis. All employees receive monthly information security awareness training. Despite these security measures, the Corporation s computer systems and infrastructure or those of third parties used by us to compile, process or store such information may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Corporation s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Government Regulation and Monetary Policy - The Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the way the Corporation conducts its business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit the Corporation s shareholders. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects short-term interest rates and credit conditions, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Bank Secrecy Act and Related Laws and Regulations - These laws and regulations have significant implications for all financial institutions. In recent years, they have increased due diligence requirements and reporting obligations for financial institutions, created new crimes and penalties, and required the federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the parties to such transactions in combating money laundering activities. Even innocent noncompliance and inconsequential failure to follow the regulations could result in significant fines or other penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - Through its subsidiary (C N Bank), the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB-Pittsburgh), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Corporation has a line of credit with the FHLB-Pittsburgh that is secured by a blanket lien on its loan portfolio. Access to this line of credit is critical if a funding need arises. However, there can be no assurance that the FHLB-Pittsburgh will be able to provide funding when needed, nor can there be assurance that the FHLB-Pittsburgh will provide funds specifically to the Corporation should its financial condition deteriorate and/or regulators prevent that access. The inability to access this source of funds could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation s financial flexibility if alternate financing is not available at acceptable interest rates. The failure of the FHLB-Pittsburgh or the FHLB system in general, may materially impair the Corporation s ability to meet short- and long-term liquidity needs or to meet growth plans. The Corporation owns common stock of the FHLB-Pittsburgh to qualify for membership in the FHLB system and access services from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. The FHLB-Pittsburgh faces a variety of risks in its operations including interest rate risk, counterparty credit risk, and adverse changes in its regulatory framework. In addition, the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB cannot meet its obligations, other FHLBs can be called upon to make required payments. Such risks affecting the FHLB-Pittsburgh could adversely impact the value of the Corporation s investment in the common stock of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and/or affect its access to credit. Soundness of Other Financial Institutions - In addition to the FHLB-Pittsburgh, the Corporation maintains other credit facilities that provide it with additional liquidity. These facilities include secured and unsecured borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and third-party commercial banks. The Corporation believes that it maintains a strong liquidity position and that it is well positioned to withstand foreseeable market conditions. However, legal agreements with counterparties typically include provisions allowing them to restrict or terminate the Corporation s access to these credit facilities with or without advance notice and at their sole discretion. Financial institutions are interconnected because of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. Financial market conditions have been negatively impacted in the past and such disruptions or adverse changes in the Corporation s results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on available sources of liquidity. Such a situation may arise due to circumstances that are outside the Corporation s control, such as general market disruptions or operational problems affecting the Corporation or third parties. The Corporation s efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or

Table of Contents 
 unanticipated reductions in available liquidity. In such events, the Corporation s cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing net interest income, or the Corporation may need to sell a portion of its securities and/or loan portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could necessitate realizing a loss. Securities Markets The fair value of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities, as well as the revenues the Corporation earns from its wealth management services, are sensitive to price fluctuations and market events. Declines in the values of the Corporation s securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, would negatively impact their value for liquidity management purposes and could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio was 63.8 million, or 11.3 , less than the amortized cost basis. The unrealized decrease in fair value was consistent with the significant increases in market interest rates that occurred in 2022, and there were no credit-related declines in fair value and no other-than-temporary losses recorded at December 31, 2022. Further increases in interest rates would cause the fair value of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio to decrease further. For additional information regarding debt securities, see the Securities section of Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation s trust revenue is determined, in part, from the value of the underlying investment portfolios. Accordingly, if the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. or international securities markets, in general, or otherwise, the Corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers level of confidence in securities markets. Mortgage Banking Since 2009, the Corporation has originated and sold residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Xtra program. Since 2014, the Corporation has also originated and sold residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Original program. Both of these programs are administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. At December 31, 2022, the total outstanding balance of residential mortgages sold and serviced through the two programs amounted to 325,677,000. The Corporation must strictly adhere to the MPF Xtra and MPF Original program guidelines for origination, underwriting and servicing loans, and failure to do so may result in the Corporation being forced to repurchase loans or being dropped from the program. As of December 31, 2022, the total outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans the Corporation has repurchased as a result of identified instances of noncompliance amounted to 1,515,000. If the volume of such forced repurchases of loans were to increase significantly, or if the Corporation were to be dropped from the programs, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Coronavirus Outbreak The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the international and U.S. economies as well as the Corporation s local economy. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and there is no guarantee that the Corporation s efforts to address any adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of new variants of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact. The effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the Corporation s business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as a result of quarantines; market volatility; market downturns; changes in consumer behavior; business closures; deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented); changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans; changes in the value of the investment securities portfolio; effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the Corporation s financial reporting and internal controls; and declines in the demand for loans and other banking services and products.

 PERFORMANCE GRAPH Set forth below is a chart comparing the Corporation s cumulative return to stockholders against the cumulative return of the Russell 2000 Index and the Corporation s peer group indices (the NASDAQ Bank Index and a Legacy Peer Group Index of similar banking organizations selected by the Corporation) for the five-year period commencing December 31, 2017 and ended December 31, 2022. The NASDAQ Bank Index has been selected to replace the existing Peer Group Index of similar-size banking organizations selected by the Corporation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the NASDAQ Bank Index is a more stable peer group that will not require changes in composition from year-to-year as the Corporation s size and complexity of operations changes. The index values are market-weighted dividend-reinvestment numbers, which measure the total return for investing 100.00 five years ago. This meets Securities Exchange Commission requirements for showing dividend reinvestment share performance over a five-year period and measures the return to an investor for placing 100.00 into a group of bank stocks and reinvesting any and all dividends into the purchase of more of the same stock for which dividends were paid.

 More detailed information concerning the Corporation s earnings results are provided in other sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis. ACQUISITION OF COVENANT FINANCIAL, INC. The Corporation s acquisition of Covenant was completed July 1, 2020. Covenant was the parent company of Covenant Bank, which operated banking offices in Bucks and Chester Counties of Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the transaction, Covenant merged with and into the Corporation and Covenant Bank merged with and into C N Bank. Total purchase consideration was 63.3 million, including common stock with a fair value of 41.6 million and cash of 21.7 million. The acquisition of Covenant followed the acquisition of Monument Bancorp, Inc. Monument on April 1, 2019. Monument was the parent company of Monument Bank, with banking and lending offices in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The total transaction value of the Monument acquisition was 42.7 million. In connection with the Covenant acquisition, effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation recorded goodwill of 24.1 million and a core deposit intangible asset of 3.1 million. Assets acquired included loans valued at 464.2 million, cash and due from banks of 97.8 million, bank-owned life insurance valued at 11.2 million and securities valued at 10.8 million. Liabilities assumed included deposits valued at 481.8 million, borrowings valued at 64.0 million and subordinated debt valued at 10.1 million. The assets purchased and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values at the time of closing subject to adjustment for up to one year subsequent to the acquisition. There were no adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Covenant acquisition subsequent to December 31, 2020. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The presentation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and recorded as a reduction of the investment in loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable. Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses, and additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is provided in a separate section later in Management s Discussion and Analysis. Given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses, it is likely that well-informed individuals could make materially different assumptions, and could, therefore calculate a materially different allowance value. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination. As described more fully in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation is adopting Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), as modified by subsequent ASUs, the required change in accounting for credit losses on loans receivable from an incurred loss methodology to an expected credit loss methodology commonly referred to as CECL. Upon adoption of CECL, the allowance for credit losses will be based on the Corporation s historical loan loss experience, borrower characteristics, forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant

 factors. The Corporation will also apply qualitative factors to account for information that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results or other relevant factors to ensure the allowance reflects management s best estimate of current expected credit losses. Fair Value of Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the Corporation s debt securities. For most of the Corporation s debt securities, the Corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service, or from brokers. In developing fair values, the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows, based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments. Based on experience, management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services. NET INTEREST INCOME The Corporation s primary source of operating income is net interest income, which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense. Tables I, II and III include information regarding the Corporation s net interest income in 2022, 2021 and 2020. In each of these tables, the amounts of interest income earned on tax-exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis. The Corporation believes presentation of net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides investors with meaningful information for purposes of comparing returns on tax-exempt securities and loans with returns on taxable securities and loans. Accordingly, the net interest income amounts reflected in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements. The discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables. 2022 vs. 2021 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was 84,354,000 in 2022, 5,280,000 (6.7 higher than in 2021. Interest income was 8,237,000 higher in 2022 as compared to 2021; interest expense was higher by 2,957,000 in comparing the same periods. As presented in Table II, the Net Interest Margin was 3.77 in 2022, as compared to 3.69 in 2021, and the Interest Rate Spread (excess of average rate of return on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) increased slightly to 3.57 in 2022 from 3.55 in 2021. The average yield on earning assets of 4.19 was 0.20 higher in 2022 as compared to 2021, and the average rate on interest bearing liabilities of 0.62 was 0.18 higher in 2022 as compared to 2021. Table III shows that, in the aggregate, rising interest rates in 2022 had a positive impact on net interest income as the portion of the increase attributable to changes in rate was 4,976,000. Income from purchase accounting-related adjustments in 2022 had a positive effect on net interest income of 1,621,000, including an increase in income on loans of 1,216,000 and a net reduction in interest expense on time deposits and borrowed funds totaling 405,000. The positive impact of purchase accounting-related adjustments to the net interest margin was 0.07 in 2022. In comparison, the net positive impact of purchase accounting-related adjustments was 2,659,000, with a positive impact on the net interest margin of 0.13 in 2021. INTEREST INCOME AND EARNING ASSETS Interest income totaled 93,873,000 in 2022, an increase of 8,237,000, or 9.6 from 2021. Interest income from available-for-sale debt securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, increased 3,610,000 in 2022 as compared to 2021, as the average balance (at amortized cost) of available-for-sale debt securities increased 168.2 million as indicated in Table II. The average yield on available-for-sale debt securities was 2.16 for 2022, down slightly from 2.17 in 2021. Interest and fees from loans receivable increased 4,289,000 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Total interest and fees from loans excluding PPP loans increased 9,861,000 in 2022 as compared to 2021. Interest and fees on PPP loans totaled 958,000 in 2022, a decrease of 5,572,000 from 2021, as previously deferred fees were recognized in income upon the SBA s repayment of loans based on forgiveness of the underlying borrowers. In 2022, total interest and fees on loans included 1,852,000 from repayments received on purchased credit impaired loans in excess of previous carrying amounts as compared to income from similar repayments of 231,000 in 2021. Average outstanding loans receivable increased 31,338,000 (2.0 to 1,628,094,000 in 2022 from 1,596,756,000 in 2021, despite a reduction in average PPP loans of 89,246,000. Average total loans outstanding, excluding PPP loans, increased 120,584,000 (8.0 ). The fully taxable equivalent yield on loans in 2022 was 4.98 compared to 4.81 in 2021. The average yield on loans included the positive impact of the income on PCI loans in 2022. The comparatively high yield on PPP loans provided a benefit to the margin in both

 periods through the higher volume resulted in a larger benefit in 2021. Excluding PPP loans and income from excess repayments on purchased credit impaired loans, the adjusted yield on loans was 4.83 in 2022, up from the similarly adjusted yield of 4.67 in 2021. Income from interest-bearing due from banks totaled 645,000 in 2022, an increase of 327,000 from the total for 2021. The average yield on interest-bearing due from banks was 1.25 in 2022 and 0.20 in 2021. The average balance of interest-bearing due from banks was 51,407,000 in 2022 as compared to 156,152,000 in 2021. The average balance of interest-bearing due from banks fell to 2.3 of average earning assets in 2022 from 7.3 in 2021 as excess funds were invested in securities and loans. Within this category, the largest asset balance in 2022 and 2021 has been interest-bearing deposits held with the Federal Reserve. INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES Interest expense increased 2,957,000, or 45.1 , to 9,519,000 in 2022 from 6,562,000 in 2021. Interest expense on deposits increased 2,100,000. Table II shows the average rate on interest-bearing deposits increased to 0.46 in 2022 from 0.33 in 2021 reflecting the impact of increases in market rates in 2022. Average total deposits (interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) increased 75,012,000 (3.9 to 1,980,412,000 in 2022 from 1,905,400 in 2021. Average time deposits decreased 42,552,000, while the average total balance of other categories increased 117,564,000, or 7.5 . The increase in average deposits includes the impact of growth in commercial deposits, reflecting higher average balances maintained and new business. Interest expense on short-term borrowings in 2022 was 429,000 as compared to 23,000 in 2021. The average balance of short-term borrowings increased to 21,766,000 in 2022 from 6,269,000 in 2021. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 1.97 in 2022 compared to 0.37 in 2021. Interest expense on long-term borrowings (FHLB advances) increased 497,000 to 896,000 in 2022 from 399,000 in 2021. The average balance of long-term borrowings was 40,194,000 in 2022, down from an average balance of 44,026,000 in 2021. Borrowings are classified as long-term within the Tables based on their term at origination or assumption in business combinations. The average rate on long-term borrowings was 2.23 in 2022 compared to 0.91 in 2021. Interest expense on senior notes issued in May 2021 totaled 477,000 in 2022 as compared to 293,000 in 2021. The average balance of the senior notes increased to 14,733,000 in 2022 from 9,129,000 in 2021. The average rate on senior notes was 3.24 in 2022 and 3.21 in 2021. Interest expense on subordinated debt decreased 230,000 to 1,079,000 in 2022 from 1,309,000 in 2021. The average balance of subordinated debt decreased slightly to 27,116,000 in 2022 from 27,399,000 in 2021. The average rate on subordinated debt decreased to 3.98 in 2022 from 4.78 in 2021 including the net impact of a new issue of subordinated debt of 24,437,000, net, at an effective rate of 3.74 in May 2021 and the redemption of subordinated notes totaling 8,000,000 in the second quarter 2021 and 8,500,000 in the second quarter 2022. 2021 vs. 2020 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was 79,074,000 in 2021, 10,529,000 (15.4 higher than in 2020. Interest income was 7,496,000 higher in 2021 as compared to 2020; interest expense was lower by 3,033,000 in comparing the same periods. As presented in Table II, the Net Interest Margin was 3.69 in 2021, unchanged from 2020, and the Interest Rate Spread (excess of average rate of return on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) increased to 3.55 in 2021 from 3.49 in 2020. The overall increase in net interest income resulted mainly from the acquisition of Covenant in the third quarter 2020 and income from the PPP loan program. Income from purchase accounting adjustments in 2021 had a positive effect on net interest income in 2021 of 2,659,000, including an increase in income on loans of 1,289,000 and net reductions in interest expense on time deposits and borrowed funds totaling 1,370,000.

 INTEREST INCOME AND EARNING ASSETS Interest income totaled 85,636,000 in 2021, an increase of 9.6 from 2020. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased 7,175,000, or 10.3 , to 76,781,000 in 2021 from 69,606,000 in 2020. Interest and fees on PPP loans totaled 6,530,000 in 2021, an increase of 3,606,000 over the total in 2020. Table III shows the increase in interest on loans including 8,016,000 attributable to an increase in volume and a decrease of 841,000 related to a decrease in average yield. The average balance of loans receivable increased 151,658,000 (10.5 to 1,596,756,000 in 2021 from 1,445,098,000 in 2020. The increase in average loans outstanding includes the effect of loans acquired from Covenant, effective July 1, 2020. The fully taxable equivalent yield on loans in 2021 was 4.81 compared to 4.82 in 2020. In 2021, rates on variable rate loans and rates on most new loan originations decreased, and prepayments of loans increased, consistent with falling market interest rates throughout most of 2020 and 2021. Further, yields on loans acquired from Covenant on July 1, 2020 were recorded at then-current market yields, which were lower than the Corporation s average portfolio yield before the acquisition. The overall yield on loans in 2021 included a benefit from the acceleration of fees recognized on PPP loans as repayments have been received from the SBA. As shown in Table II, in 2021, the average balance of 1st Draw PPP loans was 44,735,000 with an average yield of 7.77 and the average balance of 2nd Draw PPP loans was 52,917,000 with an average yield of 5.77 .

The average yield on available-for-sale debt securities decreased to 2.17 in 2021 from 2.50 in 2020, reflecting acceleration of calls and prepayments of amortizing securities and purchases of lower-yielding securities at recent, lower market rates. Interest income from interest-bearing deposits in banks totaled 318,000 in 2021, an increase of 67,000 from the total for 2020. The most significant categories of assets within this category include interest-bearing balances held with the Federal Reserve and investments in certificates of deposit issued by other banks. The average balance increased 75,565,000, as increases in deposits and funds from loan repayments outpaced uses of funds for loan originations, purchases of securities and repayments of borrowings. The average balance of interest-bearing due from banks was 7.3 of average earning assets in 2021 as compared to 4.3 in 2020. The average yield on interest-bearing due from banks fell to 0.20 in 2021 from 0.31 in 2020, due to a decrease in market rates. INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES Interest expense decreased 3,033,000, or 31.6 , to 6,562,000 in 2021 from 9,595,000 in 2020.

Total average deposit balances (interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) increased 318,991,000 to 1,905,400,000 in 2021 from 1,586,409,000 in 2020. The increase in average deposits includes the impact of the Covenant acquisition. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.33 in 2021 from 0.60 in 2020. The decrease in average rate on deposits includes a decrease of 0.54 on time deposits. The average balance of time deposits fell to 17.2 of average total deposits in 2021 from 25.1 in 2020, further contributing to the reduction in average rate on deposits. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased 344,000 to 23,000 in 2021 from 367,000 in 2020. The average balance of short-term borrowings decreased to 6,269,000 in 2021 from 34,212,000 in 2020. The average rate on short-term borrowings decreased to 0.37 in 2021 from 1.07 in 2020.

The average balance of long-term borrowings was 44,026,000 in 2021, down from an average balance of 83,500,000 in 2020. The average rate on long-term borrowings was 0.91 in 2021 compared to 1.55 in 2020. The reduction in both average balance and rate reflects the prepayment of borrowings of 48,036,000 in December 2020. Interest expense on senior notes issued in May 2021 totaled 293,000 in 2021. The average balance of the senior notes was 9,129,000 in 2021 with an average rate of 3.21 .

INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate was 17.7 of pre-tax income in 2022, down from 18.9 in 2021 and up from 17.2 in 2020. The Corporation s effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 mainly because of the effects of tax-exempt interest income. The lower effective income tax rate in 2022 as compared to 2021 includes the impact of higher tax-exempt interest as a percentage of pre-tax income, a larger permanent difference (deduction) related to restricted stock compensation and the benefit of a 340,000 reduction in expense from the reversal of tax penalties being non-deductible. The higher effective income tax rate in 2021 as compared to 2020 resulted mainly from a reduction in the proportion of tax-exempt interest income to total pre-tax income. The Corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the net deferred tax asset was 20,884,000, up from the balance at December 31, 2021 of 5,887,000. The most significant change in temporary difference components was an increase of 14,669,000 in the net deferred tax asset related to the unrealized loss on available-for-sale debt securities resulting from increases in interest rates. The Corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income. Further, the value of the benefit from realization of deferred tax assets would be impacted if income tax rates were changed from currently enacted levels. Management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2022 is fully realizable; however, if management determines the Corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset, the Corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact earnings. Additional information related to income taxes is presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. SECURITIES Management continually evaluates several objectives in determining the size, securities mix and other characteristics of the available-for-sale debt securities (investment) portfolio. Key objectives include supporting liquidity needs, maximizing return on earning assets within reasonable risk parameters and providing a means to hedge the Corporation s overall asset-sensitive interest rate risk exposure, while maintaining high credit quality. Table VI shows the composition of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The total amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities increased 50,202,000 to 561,794,000 at December 31, 2022 from 511,592,000 at December 31, 2021. The increase in 2022 followed an increase of 177,040,000 at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31,

Table of Contents 
 2020. The increase in the amortized cost basis of the securities portfolio resulted from management s decision to invest excess funds available from the growth in deposits and net loan repayments throughout most of 2020, 2021 and the first quarter 2022. At December 31, 2022, the largest categories of securities held as a percentage of total amortized cost, were as follows: (1) tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds, 38.2 ; (2) residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies, including pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, 28.1 ; and (3) commercial mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government sponsored agencies, 16.3 . The composition of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is as follows: TABLE VI - INVESTMENT SECURITIES

In comparison, the aggregate unrealized gain position was 6,087,000 (1.2 at December 31, 2021 and 14,780,000 (4.4 at December 31, 2020. The unrealized decrease in fair value of the portfolio in 2022 and in 2021 resulted from an increase in interest rates. As shown above, the market yield on the 5-year U.S. Treasury Note was 2.73 higher at December 31, 2022 in comparison to December 31, 2021, and 3.63 higher than at December 31, 2020. Management reviewed the Corporation s holdings as of December 31, 2022 and concluded there were no credit-related declines in fair value and that the unrealized losses on all of the securities in an unrealized loss position are considered temporary. In assessing whether there were other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considered (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) the intent and ability of the Corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, and (4) whether the Corporation intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. Additional information regarding the potential impact of interest rate changes on all of the Corporation s financial instruments is provided in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

 The following table presents the contractual maturities and the weighted-average yields (calculated based on amortized cost) of investment securities as of December 31, 2022. Yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For callable securities, yields on securities purchased at a discount are based on yield-to-maturity, while yields on securities purchased at a premium are based on yield to the first call date. Yields on mortgage-backed securities are estimated and include the effects of prepayment assumptions. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because counterparties may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates. As rates increase, cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease. As rates decrease, cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase due to increased refinance activity and other factors. In the table above, the entire balances and weighted-average rates for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are shown in one period. FINANCIAL CONDITION This section includes information regarding the Corporation s lending activities or other significant changes or exposures that are not otherwise addressed in Management s Discussion and Analysis. Significant changes in the average balances of the Corporation s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are described in the Net Interest Income section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. Other significant balance sheet items, including securities, the allowance for loan losses and stockholders equity, are discussed in separate sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis. There are no significant concerns that have arisen related to the Corporation s off-balance sheet loan commitments or outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2022, and management does not expect the amount of purchases of bank premises and equipment to have a material, detrimental effect on the Corporation s financial condition in 2023. Table VII shows the composition of the loan portfolio at year-end from 2018 through 2022. The significant loan growth in 2019 and 2020 reflects the impact of acquisitions. After a reduction in outstanding loans at December 31, 2021 as compared to a year earlier, loan growth was robust in 2022 as the recorded investment in commercial loans was up 133,127,000 (13.6 ), and residential mortgage loans were up 39,760,000 (7.0 ), from year-end 2021. The volume of residential mortgage loans originated and sold into the secondary market fell significantly in 2022 as higher interest rates dampened market activity. In 2022, a substantial portion of new mortgage loans the Corporation originated were 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 adjustable rate loans that were retained for investment on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2022, commercial loans represented approximately 64 of the portfolio while residential mortgage loans totaled 35 of the portfolio. While the Corporation s lending activities are primarily concentrated in its market areas, a portion of the Corporation s commercial loan segment consists of participation loans. Participation loans represent portions of larger commercial transactions for which other 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 institutions are the lead banks . Although not the lead bank, the Corporation conducts detailed underwriting and monitoring of participation loan opportunities. Participation loans are included in the Commercial and industrial , Commercial loans secured by real estate , Political subdivisions and Other commercial classes in the loan tables presented in this Form 10-K. Total participation loans outstanding amounted to 44,723,000 at December 31, 2022, down from 54,372,000 at December 31, 2021. As described in more detail in the Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses section of Management s Discussion and Analysis, the Corporation recorded partial charge-offs totaling 3,942,000 on a commercial real estate secured participation loan with a recorded investment of 2,654,000 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the balance of participation loans outstanding includes a total of 13,563,000 to businesses located outside of the Corporation s market areas. Also, included within participation loans are leveraged loans, meaning loans to businesses with minimal tangible book equity and for which the extent of collateral available is limited, though typically at the time of origination the businesses have demonstrated strong cash flow performance in their recent histories. Leveraged participation loans totaled 2,370,000 at December 31, 2022 and 7,469,000 at December 31, 2021. The Corporation originates and sells residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Xtra program administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Xtra program consist primarily of conforming, prime loans sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), a quasi-government entity. The Corporation also originates and sells residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Original program, administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Original program consist primarily of conforming, prime loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. The Corporation also may originate and sell larger-balance, nonconforming mortgages under the MPF Direct Program. The Corporation does not retain servicing rights for loans sold under the MPF Direct Program. Through December 31, 2022, the Corporation s activity under the MPF Direct Program has been minimal. For loan sales originated under the MPF programs, the Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to investors that specify, among other things, that the loans have been underwritten to the standards established by the investor. The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan and reimburse a portion of fees received or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a loan, if it is determined that the representations and warranties have not been met. Such repurchases or reimbursements generally result from an underwriting or documentation deficiency. At December 31, 2022, the total outstanding balance of loans the Corporation has repurchased as a result of identified instances of noncompliance amounted to 1,515,000, and the corresponding total outstanding balance of repurchased loans at December 31, 2021 was 1,571,000. At December 31, 2022, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced through the MPF Xtra and Original programs totaled 325,677,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of 155,506,000 and loans sold through the Original program of 170,171,000. At December 31, 2021, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced through the two programs totaled 334,741,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of 165,668,000 and loans sold through the Original Program of 169,073,000. Based on the fairly limited volume of required repurchases to date, no allowance has been established for representation and warranty exposures as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For loans sold under the Original program, the Corporation provides a credit enhancement whereby the Corporation would assume credit losses in excess of a defined First Loss Account FLA balance, up to specified amounts. The FLA is funded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh based on a percentage of the outstanding balance of loans sold. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation s maximum credit enhancement obligation under the MPF Original Program was 6,392,000, and the Corporation has recorded a related allowance for credit losses in the amount of 425,000 which is included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation s maximum credit enhancement obligation under the MPF Original Program was 8,656,000, and the related allowance for credit losses was 635,000. Income related to providing the credit enhancement (included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income) totaled 292,000 in 2022, 348,000 in 2021 and 227,000 in 2020. A credit for losses related to the credit enhancement obligation (included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income) of 172,000 was recorded in 2022 as compared to a provision for losses of 135,000 in 2021 and 167,000 in 2020. The Corporation does not provide a credit enhancement for loans sold through the Xtra program. The Corporation is a participating SBA lender. Under the terms of its arrangements with the SBA, the Corporation may originate loans to commercial borrowers, with full-or-partial guarantees by the SBA, subject to the SBA s underwriting and documentation requirements. Pursuant to an acquisition, the Corporation acquired loans with partial SBA guarantees, or in some cases, loans where the SBA-guaranteed portion of the loans had been sold back to the SBA subject to ongoing compliance with SBA underwriting and documentation requirements. As part of its due diligence, the Corporation reviewed all the purchased loans originated through the 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 various SBA loan programs as of July 1, 2020 and recorded an allowance for SBA claim adjustments. Determination of the allowance was subjective in nature and was based on the Corporation s assessment of the credit quality of the loans and the quality of the documentation supporting compliance with SBA requirements. The Corporation s total exposure related to SBA guarantees on purchased loans was 4,847,000 at December 31, 2022 and 12,856,000 at December 31, 2021 with an allowance for SBA claim adjustments (included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets) of 90,000 at December 31, 2022 and 457,000 at December 31, 2021.

Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination. The allowance for loan losses was 16,615,000 at December 31, 2022, up from 13,537,000 at December 31, 2021. Table X shows total specific allowances on impaired loans of 453,000 at December 31, 2022, down from 740,000 at December 31, 2021. Table X also shows the increase in the allowance in 2022 is mainly related to commercial loans, as the collectively evaluated portion of the allowance related to the commercial segment increased to 10,845,000 at December 31, 2022 from 7,553,000 at December 31, 2021. Table X also shows that the allowance has increased at each year-end from 2018 through 2022, reflecting the impact of loan growth and other factors, though the total specific allowance on individually impaired loans has decreased each year. Table XI shows the allowance for loan losses totaled 0.95 of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, up from 0.87 at December 31, 2021. This ratio declined in 2019 and again in 2020 when loans acquired in business combinations were recorded at their initial fair values, including an estimated adjustment for credit losses, with no allowance initially recorded on those loans. Accordingly, the allowance as a percentage of loans dipped from 1.12 at December 31, 2018 to 0.83 at December 31, 2019 following the Monument acquisition and then to 0.69 at December 31, 2020 following the Covenant acquisition. Table XI also shows that the total of the allowance and the credit adjustment on purchased non-impaired loans, as a percentage of total loans plus the credit adjustment, was 1.06 at December 31, 2022, in line with ratios from the previous years.

The charge-offs resulted from the borrower s default due to deterioration in financial performance. The recorded investment in the loan at December 31, 2022 (principal balance, net of partial charge-offs) was 2,654,000

 based on a settlement agreement reached with the borrower. At March 7, 2023, after the impact of payments received pursuant to the settlement agreement, the recorded investment in the loan was 474,000. The 2022 provision also includes 1,269,000 related to a net increase in historical loss factors, most of which resulted from the partial charge-offs just described. Further, the 2022 provision includes 3,974,000 attributable to increases in loan volume resulting from significant loan growth, particularly for the commercial segment, as well as an increase in the collectively determined portion of the allowance related to management s updated assessment of purchased performing loans. In 2022, changes in qualitative factors resulted in a reduction in the provision of 2,207,000, including reductions of 1,229,000 related to the commercial segment and 965,000 related to the residential mortgage segment. The reduction in the provision from changes in qualitative factors reflects management s assessment that despite concerns that have arisen related to a limited number of commercial loans, the overall credit quality of the portfolio has been improving over the past several quarters. In the tables immediately above, the portion of the net change in the collectively determined allowance attributable to loan growth was determined by applying the historical loss experience and qualitative factors used in the allowance calculation at the end of the preceding period to the net increase or reduction in loans outstanding (excluding loans specifically evaluated for impairment) for the period. The effect on the provision of changes in historical loss experience and qualitative factors, as shown in the tables above, was determined by: (1) calculating the net change in each factor used in determining the allowance at the end of the period as compared to the preceding period, and (2) applying the net change in each factor to the outstanding balance of loans at the end of the preceding period (excluding loans specifically evaluated for impairment). In 2022, net charge-offs were 4,177,000, including recoveries of 68,000 and charge-offs of 4,245,000. Table XII shows the average rate of net charge-offs as a percentage of loans was 0.26 in 2022, up from the annual average rates for the previous 4 years ranging from a high of 0.16 in 2020 to a low of 0.02 in 2018 and the 5-year average of 0.13 . Table XI presents information related to past due and impaired loans, and loans that have been modified under terms that are considered TDRs. At December 31, 2022, impaired loans totaled 19,358,000, up from 15,734,000 at December 31, 2021. Similarly, total nonperforming loans of 25,322,000 at December 31, 2022 was up from 21,218,000 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, advances to a commercial borrower under lines of credit totaling 10,799,000 were classified as impaired and nonaccrual. Based on an estimate of the liquidation value of business assets that collateralize the lines of credit, there was no specific allowance recorded on these advances at December 31, 2022. Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of outstanding loans was 1.46 at December 31, 2022, up from 1.36 at December 31, 2021, and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.04 at December 31, 2022, up from 0.94 at December 31, 2021. Table XI presents data at the end of each of the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2022. Table XI shows that the year-end ratio of total nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of 0.88 in 2019 to a high of 1.94 in 2018 and the ratio of total nonperforming assets as a percentage of assets ranged from a low of 0.80 in 2019 to a high of 1.37 in 2018. Over the period 2018-2022, each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts. As a result, a limited number of relationships may significantly impact the total amount of allowance required on impaired loans, and may significantly impact the provision for loan losses and the amount of total charge-offs reported in any one period. Management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans, estimates of loss, and nonaccrual status; however, the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of December 31, 2022. Tables IX through XII present historical data related to loans and the allowance for loan losses. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2023, the Corporation is adopting the required change in accounting for credit losses on loans receivable from an incurred loss methodology to an expected credit loss methodology commonly referred to as CECL. The allowance for credit losses will be based on the Corporation s historical loss experience, borrower characteristics, forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors. The Corporation will also apply qualitative factors to account for information that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results or other relevant factors to ensure the allowance reflects management s best estimate of current expected credit losses. The Corporation is adopting CECL on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective approach. Based on implementation efforts to date, management estimates CECL adoption will result in a reduction in retained earnings estimated at 1,000,000 to 3,000,000, net of 
 33

 tax. Management estimates CECL adoption will result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 over the balance in the allowance for loan losses of 16,615,000 at December 31, 2022. The Corporation is in the process of finalizing its expected credit loss estimates and the operational and control structure supporting the process.

The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan and reimburse a portion of fees received or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a loan, if it is determined that the representations and warranties have not been met. At December 31, 2022, outstanding balances of such loans sold totaled 325,677,000. Also, for loans sold under the MPF Original program, the Corporation provides a credit enhancement. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation s maximum credit enhancement obligation under the MPF Original Program was 6,392,000, and the Corporation has recorded a related allowance for credit losses in the amount of 425,000 which is included in Accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As discussed in the Financial Condition section of Management s Discussion and Analysis, the Corporation is a participating SBA lender and may originate loans to commercial borrowers, with full-or-partial guarantees by the SBA, subject to the SBA s underwriting and documentation requirements. In some cases, the Corporation may sell the SBA-guaranteed portion of the loan back to the SBA subject to ongoing compliance with SBA underwriting and documentation requirements. If it is determined that the ongoing compliance requirements are not met, the Corporation could be subject to claim adjustments on SBA guaranteed loans. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation s total exposure to SBA guarantees was 4,847,000 with a recorded claims adjustment allowance of 90,000, included in accrued interest and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

 LIQUIDITY Liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost. An adequate liquidity position permits the Corporation to pay creditors, compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation maintained overnight interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and other correspondent banks totaling 21,887,000. The Corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day-to-day liquidity. Also, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, secured by various mortgage loans. The Corporation has a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia s Discount Window. Management intends to use this line of credit as a contingency funding source. As collateral for the line, the Corporation has pledged available-for-sale securities with a carrying value of 24,113,000 at December 31, 2022. The Corporation s outstanding, available, and total credit facilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

At December 31, 2021, the Corporation s outstanding credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh consisted of long-term borrowings of 27,727,000 and letters of credit totaling 5,584,000. Additionally, the Corporation uses RepoSweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis. If required to raise cash in an emergency situation, the Corporation could sell available-for-sale debt securities to meet its obligations. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of available-for-sale debt securities in excess of amounts required to meet pledging or repurchase agreement obligations was 272,475,000. Management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to meet its short-term and long-term obligations. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY Details concerning capital ratios at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes, as of December 31, 2022, that C N Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and maintains a capital conservation buffer (described in more detail below) that allows the Bank to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Further, the Corporation s and C N Bank s capital ratios at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 exceed the Corporation s Board policy threshold levels. Management expects C N Bank to maintain capital levels that exceed the regulatory standards for well-capitalized institutions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. Future dividend payments and repurchases of common stock will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition, future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Corporation and C N Bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities. These restrictions are described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Further, although the Corporation is no longer subject to the specific consolidated capital requirements described herein, the Corporation s ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in other activities may be limited by the Federal Reserve if the Corporation fails to hold sufficient capital commensurate with its overall risk profile.

Table of Contents 
 To avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization subject to the rule must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2022, the minimum risk-based capital ratios, and the capital ratios including the capital conservation buffer, are as follows: 

Minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.5 Minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 7.0 Minimum tier 1 capital ratio 6.0 Minimum tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 8.5 Minimum total capital ratio 8.0 Minimum total capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 10.5 A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 over the minimum risk-based capital ratios would not be subject to additional limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer less than 2.5 would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. Also, a banking organization is prohibited from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 as of the beginning of that quarter. Eligible net income is defined as net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital conservation buffer is as follows: 

Capital Conservation Buffer Maximum Payout (as a of risk-weighted assets) (as a of eligible retained income) Greater than 2.5 No payout limitation applies 2.5 and >1.875 60 1.875 and >1.25 40 1.25 and >0.625 20 0.625 0 At December 31, 2022, C N Bank s Capital Conservation Buffer (determined based on the minimum total capital ratio) was 6.68 . As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation is adopting CECL on January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective approach. Based on implementation efforts to date, management estimates CECL adoption will result in a reduction in retained earnings estimated at 1,000,000 to 3,000,000, net of tax. Management estimates CECL adoption will result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 over the balance in the allowance for loan losses of 16,615,000 at December 31, 2022. Banking regulators permit transitional relief of incremental capital requirements from CECL adoption by utilizing a 3-year optional phase-in. Management does not expect to utilize the phased-in approach and expects to record the entire cumulative effect adjustment against regulatory capital at the time of adoption. The Corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available-for-sale debt securities. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is excluded from the Bank s and Corporation s regulatory capital ratios. The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, amounted to 50,370,000 at December 31, 2022 as compared to the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax of 4,809,000 at December 31, 2021 and 11,676,000 at December 31, 2020. The decrease in stockholders equity in 2022 from the change in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income resulted from an increase in interest rates. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity. If available-for-sale debt securities are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings, and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced. The securities section of Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information concerning management s evaluation of available-for-sale debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment at December 31, 2022.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the Corporation s financial instruments. In addition to the effects of interest rates, the market prices of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums (amounts of spread over risk-free rates) demanded by investors. Management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the Corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position (discussed in the Stockholders Equity and Capital Adequacy section of Management s Discussion and Analysis) and ample sources of liquidity (discussed in the Liquidity section of Management s Discussion and Analysis). The Corporation s major category of market risk, interest rate risk, is discussed in the following section. INTEREST RATE RISK The Corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the economic value of equity. For purposes of these calculations, the economic value of equity includes the discounted present values of financial instruments, such as securities, loans, deposits and borrowed funds, and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses. The model measures and projects the amount of potential changes in net interest income, and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments, assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. Management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus 100-400 basis points of current rates. The projected results based on the model includes the impact of estimates, at each level of interest rate change, regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and call activity on other investment securities. Further, the projected results are impacted by assumptions regarding the run-off and the extent of sensitivity to interest rate changes of deposits with no stated maturity (checking, savings and money market accounts). Actual results could vary significantly from these estimates, which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest income and economic value of equity. Also, the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition, and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. The Corporation s Board of Directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk, based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. The policy limits acceptable fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline (flat rates) one-year scenario and variances in the economic value of equity from the baseline values based on current rates. Table XIII, which follows this discussion, is based on the results of calculations performed using the simulation model as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The table shows the Corporation s net interest income profile is asset-sensitive, meaning net interest income increases in the upward rate scenarios and decreases in the downward rate scenarios. The table also shows that as of the respective dates, the changes in net interest income and changes in economic value were within the policy limits in all scenarios. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value as of each balance sheet date. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Increases in interest rates have caused the fair value of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities to decrease, resulting in an accumulated other comprehensive loss of 50.4 million at December 31, 2022. In contrast, most of the Corporation s other financial instruments, including loans receivable (held for investment), deposits and borrowed funds are carried on the balance sheet at historical cost without adjustment for the impact of changes in interest rates. As noted above, for purposes of calculations based on the simulation model, the discounted present values of all of the Corporation s financial instruments are estimated for each interest rate shock scenario. As shown in Table XIII, the results of the simulation model indicate the economic value of equity would increase by 1.1 or less in all upward rate shock scenarios except for the +200 basis point scenario for which it would decrease by 0.1 . The economic value of equity would decrease in the downward rate shock scenarios. In

Table of Contents 
 the upward rate shock scenarios, although the value of securities and fixed rate loans would decline, the magnitude of the projected economic benefit from changes in the value of deposits would approximately offset the negative impact related to securities and loans. Conversely, in the downward rate shock scenarios, the magnitude of the negative impact to the value of nonmaturity deposits would exceed the amount of appreciation in the value of securities and loans.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS reportable segment, Community Banking. All of the Corporation s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the activities of the Corporation supports the others. The Corporation is subject to competition from other financial institutions. It is also subject to regulation by certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examination by those regulatory authorities.

 allowance for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was required. The allowance consists primarily of two major components (1) a specific component based on a detailed assessment of certain larger loan relationships, mainly commercial purpose, determined on a loan-by-loan basis; and (2) a general component for the remainder of the portfolio based on a collective evaluation of pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The general component is assigned to each pool of loans based on both historical net charge-off experience, and an evaluation of certain qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the above methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.

 and any residential mortgage or consumer loans of or more for which there is at least one extension of credit graded Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful. Loans that are individually reviewed, but which are determined to not be impaired, are combined with all remaining loans that are not reviewed on a specific basis, and such loans are included within larger pools of loans based on similar risk and loss characteristics for purposes of determining the general component of the allowance. All loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDR) and all commercial loan relationships less than or other loan relationships less than in the aggregate, but with an estimated loss of or more, are individually evaluated for impairment. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered individually impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous classes of loans, such as residential real estate, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. Accordingly, the Corporation generally does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless such a loan: (1) is subject to a restructuring agreement, (2) has an outstanding balance of or more and a credit grade of Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, or (3) has an estimated loss of or more. The pools of loans for each loan segment are evaluated for loss exposure based upon average historical net charge-off rates, adjusted for qualitative factors. The time period used in determining the average historical net charge-off rate for each loan class is based on management s evaluation of an appropriate time period that captures an historical loss experience relevant to the current portfolio. Qualitative risk factors (described in the following paragraph) are evaluated for the impact on each of the distinct segments (residential mortgage, commercial and consumer) within the loan portfolio. Each qualitative factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Any adjustments to the factors are supported by a narrative documentation of changes in conditions accompanying the allowance for loan losses calculation. The qualitative factors used in the general component calculations are designed to address credit risk characteristics associated with each segment. The Corporation s credit risk associated with all of the segments is significantly impacted by these factors, which include economic conditions within its market area, the Corporation s lending policies, changes or trends in the portfolio, risk profile, competition, regulatory requirements and other factors. Purchased loans that did not show evidence of credit deterioration at the acquisition dates were initially recorded at fair value, including a discount for credit losses reflecting an estimate of the present value of credit losses based on market expectations. The general component of the allowance on purchased loans is evaluated separately from the rest of the portfolio. This evaluation includes consideration of the qualitative risk factors described above as well as the remaining purchased discount. Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial loans by the fair value of the collateral (if the loan is collateral dependent), by future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective rate or by the loan s observable market price. For commercial loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.

 at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021. Trust revenue is included within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. Trust revenue is recorded on a cash basis, which is not materially different from the accrual basis. The majority (approximately , based on annual 2022 results) of trust revenue is earned and collected monthly, with the amount determined based on a percentage of the fair value of the trust assets under management. Wealth management fees are contractually agreed with each customer, and fee levels vary based mainly on the size of assets under management. The services provided under such a contract represent a single performance obligation under the Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) because it embodies a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. None of the contracts with trust customers provide for incentive-based fees. In addition to wealth management fees, trust revenue includes fees for provision of services, including employee benefit plan administration, tax return preparation and estate planning and settlement. Fees for such services are billed based on contractual arrangements or established fee schedules and are typically billed upon completion of providing such services.

Cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates. In the table above, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are shown in one period. Investment securities carried at at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021 were pledged as collateral for public deposits, trusts and certain other deposits, as provided by law, totaling at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021. See Note 12 for information concerning securities pledged to secure borrowing arrangements and Note 20 for information related to securities pledged against interest rate swap obligations. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment OTTI at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether the Corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. A summary of information management considered in evaluating debt and equity securities for OTTI at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is provided below. Debt Securities At December 31, 2022 and 2021, management performed an assessment for possible OTTI of the Corporation s debt securities on an issue-by-issue basis, relying on information obtained from various sources, including publicly available financial data, ratings by external agencies, brokers and other sources. The extent of individual analysis applied to each security depended on the size of the Corporation s investment, as well as management s perception of the credit risk associated with each security. As reflected in the table above, gross unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale debt securities totaled at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021. The increase in gross unrealized holding losses in 2022 was consistent with the significant increase in market interest rates that occurred during the period. Based on the results of the assessment, management believes there were no credit-related declines in fair value and that impairment of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is temporary.

Under the risk rating system, the Corporation classifies problem or potential problem loans as Special Mention, Substandard, or Doubtful on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loans that do not currently expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant classification as Substandard or Doubtful, but possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Risk ratings are updated any time that conditions or the situation warrants. Loans not classified are included in the Pass column in the table that follows.

Standby letters of credit Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation, for extensions of credit is based on management s credit assessment of the counterparty. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation guaranteeing performance by a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Some of the standby letters of credit are collateralized by real estate or other assets, and others are unsecured. The extent to which proceeds from liquidation of collateral would be expected to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments related to standby letters of credit is not estimable. The Corporation has recorded liability associated with standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Foreclosed assets held for sale consist of real estate acquired by foreclosure. For impaired commercial loans secured by real estate and foreclosed assets held for sale, estimated fair values are determined primarily using values from third-party appraisals. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, quantitative information regarding significant techniques and inputs used for nonrecurring fair value measurements using unobservable inputs (Level 3 methodologies) are as follows: Sales comparison Discount to appraised value Commercial and industrial Liquidation of assets Discount to appraised value Total impaired loans Foreclosed assets held for sale - real estate: Commercial real estate Sales comparison Discount to appraised value Total foreclosed assets held for sale

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Stockholders and Board of Directors of Citizens Northern Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citizens Northern Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Corporation s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable

 assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Allowance for Loan Losses Qualitative Factors Critical Audit Matter Description As described in Note 1 and Note 8 to the Corporation s consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses consists of two major components: (1) a specific component consisting of the valuation allowance for loans individually evaluated for impairment specific component and (2) a general component consisting of the valuation allowance for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics collectively evaluated for impairment general reserves ). The general reserves are further broken down as reserves assigned to each pool of loans based on both historical net charge-off experience and reserves related to qualitative factors. The determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of judgment relating to how those assumptions impact probable incurred credit losses within the loan portfolio. Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the Corporation s financial results. Qualitative risk factors are evaluated for the impact on each of the three distinct loan segments (residential mortgage, commercial and consumer) within the loan portfolio. Each qualitative factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Management has designed qualitative factors that include such factors as 1) economic conditions within its market area, 2) the Corporation s lending policies, 3) changes or trends in the portfolio, 4) risk profile, 5) competition, and 6) regulatory requirements. To formulate the additional allocations to the allowance for loan losses for general reserve qualitative factors, management multiplies the outstanding principal balance of the various loan classes by the applicable qualitative factor. Management s identification and analysis of these issues requires significant judgment. We identified the estimate of the general reserve s qualitative factors of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter as auditing the underlying qualitative factors requires significant auditor judgment as amounts determined by management rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes significant estimation uncertainty. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included, among others: Obtaining an understanding of the management review control over the determination, review and approval of the qualitative factors, including controls over the underlying internal and external data inputs, and testing such control for design and operating effectiveness. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s judgments related to qualitative factor adjustments to determine if they are calculated in accordance with management s policies and consistently applied.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Corporation s management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed in reports the Corporation files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Corporation s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Corporation s system of internal control over financial reporting has been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Corporation s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Corporation s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporation s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect and correct misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Baker Tilly US, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Corporation s consolidated financial statements, has issued an audit report on the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. That report appears immediately prior to this report. March 16, 2023 By: /s/ J. Bradley Scovill Date President and Chief Executive Officer March 16, 2023 By: /s/ Mark A. Hughes Date Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer

 This Certificate and the shares of Stock hereby represented are subject to the provisions of the Corporation s Stock Incentive Plan and a certain agreement entered into between the owner and the Corporation pursuant to said Plan. The release of the Certificate and the shares of Stock hereby represented from such provision shall occur only as provided by said Plan and Agreement, a copy of which are on file in the office of the Secretary of the Corporation.

Release and Lapse of Restricted Shares. The release of restrictions or expiration of restricted shares awarded under this agreement shall occur over a period of three years. On each anniversary date of this award, up to one-third of the total shares will be distributed based on the Corporation s attainment of earnings-based performance standards, based on the following criteria: 

Release of 50 (one-sixth of the total shares awarded) each year will be based on the Corporation achieving a percent ranking of at least 35 of the Core Return on Average Equity (ROAE) within a defined peer group of bank holding companies and thrifts for the defined measurement period as determined by the committee. 
 Release of 50 (one-sixth of the total shares awarded) each year will be based on the Corporation achieving a percent ranking of at least 65 of the Core Return on Average Assets (ROAA) within a defined peer group of bank holding companies and thrifts for the defined measurement period as determined by the committee. 
 For the purpose of determining Core ROAE and Core ROAA. nonrecurring items, as determined by the Committee (to include nonrecurring acquisition expenses), and securities gains and losses, will be excluded from the Corporation s and the peer group s earnings results. The Corporation s earnings will include the operating results of newly acquired business units and the Corporation s and the peer group s ROAE and ROAA will be compared on an after-tax basis. The peer group shall include selected publicly traded Commercial Banks and Thrifts within a geographic region reflective of Citizens Northern s market area and with total assets of approximately one-half to 2 times those of Citizens Northern. The Committee reserves the right to change the composition of the peer group, as well as the method of evaluating the Corporation s Core ROAE and Core ROAA performance as compared to the peer group, based on mergers or acquisitions involving members of the peer group, changes in size of the Corporation or members of the peer group, or other factors deemed appropriate by the Committee. All Restricted Shares not distributed due to the Corporation failing to achieve the defined earnings-based performance standards shall expire and revert back to the Corporation as of the anniversary date on which such determinations are made. No partial shares may be released, thus an amount equal to the next whole share amount will be released subject to the specified performance criteria at each anniversary. The shares released may be in certificate form or may be directed to be held in a custodial account designated by the Recipient. 5. Terms of Forfeiture. If a Recipient s employment with the Corporation, or a subsidiary, ceases for any reason prior to the lapse of the restrictions, conditions or terms applicable to his or her Restricted Stock, all of the Recipient s Restricted Stock still subject to unexpired restrictions, conditions or terms shall be forfeited absolutely by the Recipient to the Corporation without payment or delivery of any consideration or other thing of value by the Corporation or its affiliates, and thereupon and thereafter neither the Recipient nor his or her heirs, personal or legal representatives, successors, assigns, beneficiaries, or any claimants under the Recipient s Last Will or laws of descent and distribution, shall have any rights or claims to or interests in the forfeited Restricted Stock or any certificates representing shares thereof, or claims against the Corporation or its affiliates with respect thereto.

 CITIZENS NORTHERN BANK 
 
 EXHIBIT 10.4 2023 Annual Performance Incentive Award Plan ) Part I: Plan Administration Section 1 : Purpose of the Plan The purpose of the Performance Incentive Award Plan the Plan is to provide variable compensation to those employees in key positions who attain and sustain consistently high levels of performance by meeting and exceeding goals and expectations that contribute to the success, profitability, and return to the shareholders of Citizens Northern Corporation and affiliated Employer(s). The Plan is designed to support operational objectives and financial goals as defined by the long-range and short-range strategic and financial Plans. Additionally, the Plan is designed to provide a component of the management compensation package essential to retaining and attracting quality employees to key positions that contribute significantly to the bank s financial performance. A key position for the purpose of this plan is a job role that is typically, within the community banking and financial services industries, eligible for performance-based incentive compensation. Section 2 : General Description There are three components of the Plan: (1) corporate performance ; (2) unit/functional performance ; and (3) individual performance . The corporate performance component will be subject to the Corporation s attainment of financial goals relative to a defined peer group. To receive the corporate bonus payout, the company must achieve at least the threshold level. The unit/functional component is based on the attainment of pre-established goals by the participant and often a team of participants in a given business unit, e.g., retail branch system, commercial lending team. Depending upon the participant s function, Key Performance Indicators for the participant s region, or the corporation as a whole, also may be evaluated to determine the unit/functional bonus. To receive the unit/functional bonus payout, the participant must achieve at least the threshold level. Further, the individual performance component will be subject to an evaluation of the participants overall contributions to the team . To earn the individual component, the participant must attain at least the threshold performance level. Even after attaining at least the Threshold performance, the plan permits the participant s supervisor or the executive officer for the participant s area to recommend no bonus payout, or a reduced amount (Corporate, Unit/Functional or Individual) if aspects of the participant s performance are deemed unsatisfactory. 
 ) Employees who are actively engaged in interviewing residential real estate mortgage applicants, processing the applications and closing the loans are excluded from this plan. The Corporation has a separate incentive award plan for such employees. 

The Plan protects shareholders interests by requiring that the goals established will enhance bottom line performance while not encouraging excessive risk-taking and that a minimum level of performance is achieved before any incentive award can be made. At the same time the Plan provides management with a means to retain and attract top performers who increase the organization s financial performance by attaining their performance goals. The Plan requires that management perform an annual assessment and establishment of goals and provides a performance review and measurement system. The Plan requires management to consider non-financial goals designed to improve operational and risk management effectiveness, as well as financial goals, as appropriate for each participant s position. The Plan permits future inclusion of additional positions during a Plan year, if the need arises. The calculation of the bonus to be distributed to the Plan participants, and the incentive formulas, are constructed to provide awards consistent with strong corporate financial performance and the participant s exceptional performance in his/her unit/functional area. The incentive formulas ensure a level of incentive award that is competitive with comparable positions and job levels in similar financial institutions, thus enabling Citizens Northern to attract, retain, and motivate high-performing personnel and support continued growth and profitability. The determination of the bonus payable is described in Part II of this Plan. The Plan is established to augment regular salary and benefit programs already in existence. The Incentive Plan is not meant to be a substitute for salary increases but supplemental to salary and as stated earlier, a reward for exceptional performance. The Plan has been developed to recognize that the amount of incentive bonus award attainable by key executives should vary depending upon the executive s position with the company and the competitive levels of incentive bonus for those positions within the banking and financial service industry. Thus threshold, target and maximum Incentive Opportunities are established for each position. Section 3 : Other Payment Conditions Termination for Reasons Other Than Death, Permanent Disability or Retirement In the event of termination of employment for reasons other than death, permanent disability or retirement, the participant, at the discretion of the committee, may forfeit all unpaid incentive awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board, and management, reserve the right to deny or modify an award to any participant. Such action may be due to, but not limited to, the failure of the participant to properly perform during the Plan year. Economic or other circumstances and considerations may dictate that incentive bonuses be reduced or eliminated in any given year. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may amend, alter or terminate the Plan at any time. In the event a participant becomes disabled for a period greater than two (2) weeks, any salary continuation as a result of the Corporation s short and long-term disability programs will not be included in the base salary used for the incentive bonus calculation. Section 4 : Administration of the Plan 
 Page 2 of 6 

Throughout this Plan, reference to the actions and authority of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee also presumes that the Committee will recommend, and the board of directors will approve or disapprove, final disposition of all matters pertaining to administration of the Plan. The Committee, with board approval, has the responsibility to interpret, administer, and amend the Plan as necessary. The recommendations of the Committee as approved by the board, affecting the construction, interpretation, and administration of the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties, including the Corporation, its subsidiaries and employees. At or before the beginning of each Plan year, the Committee will review and may revise the operating rules. Performance targets the Incentive Bonus Plan Performance Matrix, and the Incentive Opportunity levels for corporate, individual and unit/functional awards for attaining those targets may be changed in order to emphasize specific goals and objectives of the Plan and to maintain a competitive incentive program. However, it is expected that the Plan will require modification only when significant changes in the organization, goals, personnel, or performance occur. The Chief Executive Officer shall be the Plan Administrator with the power to control and oversee proper administration of the Plan, and may recommend to the Committee proposed changes to the operating rules. Additionally, the Committee may engage a third party expert to review and amend the plan. An individual or individuals designated by the Chief Executive Officer will perform the computation of incentive awards. Maintenance of participant payment records shall be the responsibility of the Human Resource Director. Finally, the committee, with board approval, may exclude extraordinary occurrences, which could affect the performance awards, either positively or negatively, but are by their nature outside the significant influence of Plan participants. The characteristics of such extraordinary occurrences are generally that they involve the senior management and the board of directors in: The original decision to take some action. Mission-driven strategic Initiatives that sacrifice short-term income for long-term gain. Issues most related to a restructuring of assets, or unusual expense or income realization. Extraordinary occurrences may be excluded when calculating performance results to ensure that the best interests of the shareholders are protected and are not brought into conflict with the intent of the Plan. When and if extraordinary occurrences are excluded from the calculation of corporate performance measures, they should also be excluded in calculating the bonus. Section 5 : Plan Participants Executive management shall select and recommend for participation in the Plan employees in those job positions that are responsible for directing, implementing and performing functions that have a significant influence on the profitability and operational performance of the bank (key employees). Those job positions which are selected for participation in the Plan will be in positions that normally include an incentive bonus component in the compensation package offered by similar financial institutions. 
 Page 3 of 6 

At or before the beginning of each Plan year, the Committee shall review the recommendations of management on the selection of those positions eligible for participation in the Plan for that year.

Participants shall be notified of their eligibility as soon as selection is completed and the board of directors has adopted the Plan. The Committee shall review and recommend the inclusion of participants to the full board for their approval. Positions and thus participants may be added during the Plan year at the discretion of management and the Committee, and the incentive award will be prorated from date of entry into the Plan. Section 6 : Payment of Individual Incentive Compensation Awards Within 60 days following the end of the Plan year and as soon as the participant s performance has been evaluated and the financial and operating results are known, participants will receive their incentive payment as determined by the Incentive Bonus Plan Performance Matrix. Section 7 : Incentive Compensation Plan Operating Rules Before the beginning of each Plan year, the Committee may review and revise, if deemed appropriate, Part II: Operating Rules of the Plan for the year then beginning. The operating rules shall include the following: a) Identification of positions selected for participation in the Plan b) The method for determining the amount of the total bonus to be paid to Plan participants, including the Incentive Bonus Plan Performance Matrix. c) Schedules and formulas for determining the amount of the incentive compensation awards to Plan participants for the Plan year then beginning, including threshold, target and maximum performance measures and the percentage of bonus award determined by corporate, functional/unit and individual performances. Participants will be informed at or before the Plan year of the manner in which performance will be evaluated. d) Other administrative and procedural rules, which the committee considers appropriate. After approval by the Committee and the board of directors, management shall, as soon as practical, inform each of the participants of the operating rules for the Plan year then beginning.

Section 9 : Amendment or Termination of Plan The committee, with concurrence of the board of directors, may terminate, amend, or modify this Plan at any time.

Dear Shareholder,
Welcome to the 2022 edition of C N s Annual
Highlights. Each year, we use this report as an
opportunity to reflect on the prior year and share
with you the achievements we ve made along
the way. As we look back on the last 12 months,
a guiding principle that has been consistent
across our organization is connection. The
connections we have with our customers,
our teammates, our communities, and our
shareholders are what drive our mission of
 Creating value through lifelong relationships, 
and collectively enable us to deliver robust
financial results and customized solutions year
after year.
C N posted net income of 26.6 million or
 1.71 per share in 2022, compared to 30.6
million or 1.92 per share in 2021. While there
were a variety of factors that influenced these
results, our strong fundamentals were in clear
view as growth in all regions substantially offset
the headwinds of higher interest rates, volatile
equity markets, and inflation that significantly
impacted both revenues and expenses. As a
reflection of the company s ongoing strength,
cash dividends to shareholders increased from
 1.11 per share in 2021 to 1.12 per share during
2022, producing a yield of 4.90 on the year-end share price of 22.86.
Solid loan and deposit growth during the year
drove an increase of 5.2 million in net interest
income despite a decrease in PPP revenues of
 5.6 million. The net interest margin reached
3.77 compared to 3.69 in 2021 reflecting
the benefit of rising interest rates on asset
yields relative to the cost of funds. The Federal
Reserve s commitment to taming inflation by
rapidly increasing rates had a major impact on
revenue from the sale of mortgage loans, which
dropped by 2.7 million, or nearly 78 . Overall
wealth management (Trust, Brokerage 
Insurance) revenues increased modestly despite
a decline of nearly 20 in the S P 500 index,
a key indicator of broad market performance.
Noninterest expenses increased by 5.5
million, or 8.8 , through the combination of the
higher cost of talent and ongoing investments
in technology. Finally, the loan loss provision
increased 3.6 million, or 98 , from 2021
primarily due to losses related to a single credit
relationship. Overall credit quality remained
strong throughout the year.
The company s financial performance and
risk profile have been resilient through the
recent volatility, a nod to the expertise and
collaboration of our commercial, retail,
mortgage, treasury, and wealth management
business lines and the related diverse revenue
streams. As the impact of continued rate
increases takes hold, many economists are
forecasting a recession. Combined with the war
in Ukraine, political division in the United States

and a challenging regulatory mindset, the overall
operating environment is demanding and not
expected to relent as we turn the calendar to 2023.
Nevertheless, through investments in people and
technology, C N advanced on multiple fronts in
2022 and our year of transformation saw fostered
connections evolve into opportunities for value.
Branches Roots
In a personal sense, we ve all experienced the
journey any given relationship takes it starts with
an initial point of contact where a connection is
established.
When you re a C N customer, that point of
connection could be striking up a conversation
with a personal banker at your local C N office or
logging in to your mobile banking app when you re
on the go. Wherever the connection is made, we
want it to be memorable and set the foundation
for a strong relationship. That s why, over the past
year, we ve been refining the ways we can make
our connections - whether in-person or digital -
more integrated, seamless, and customized.
While this first connection is undoubtedly
important, staying connected takes time, work, and
commitment, and over the course of the last few
years, we have had to rethink how it s done. With
the recent remodeling across our branch network
almost complete, we have realigned the banking
space from being purely transactional to being
a place where our clients can engage in deeper
discussion with our teams. Relaxed conversation
spaces rather than teller lines now take center
stage, supporting the exchange of thoughtful
dialogue to reach helpful solutions.
We ve paired our service-first approach with
enhanced training opportunities for our teammates.
With the introduction of our Client Engagement
Blueprint, we are equipping C N experts to engage
customers in meaningful business relationships,
instead of simply teaching transactional processes.
Additionally, we have a dedicated group of
teammates led by our Customer Experience
Coordinator, to leverage feedback from customers
and teammates and identify and solve areas of
friction along the customer journey.
By listening to our customers and recognizing their
needs, our teams are taking connection point 
opportunities to make banking smoother and offer
the right solution for each unique need. Our Home
Equity Line Lock, rolled out last March, offers
homeowners an extended draw period and flexible
loan term so they can continue to invest in their
homes while securing a competitive interest rate.
This is a good option for homeowners needing
flexibility in scheduling their improvements or
additions. In November, we introduced our
14-month EZ Access Flex CD in response to the
rapid increase in market interest rates. This product
is an example of how our teammates recognized
an opportunity to offer a timely investment option
to bring even more value to our customers assets.
Another area where intentional connections and
thoughtful conversations are yielding results is in
our Wealth Management team. With the addition of
EVP Chief Wealth Management Officer Matthew
Bower early last year, the wealth team is better
positioned to make substantial gains in 2023. In
its 62nd year and with over 1 billion in assets
under management, C N Wealth Management
will continue to provide tailored investment advice
and wealth planning solutions through its client-focused and transparent approach.
Our mortgage teams have a history of bringing
value to our customers through specialized
lending products. The
EcoEquity home
improvement
loan, launched
in the fourth
quarter of
2022, 

06 | President CEO
continued this tradition by offering a solution
for clients to finance their residential solar,
wind, or geothermal home improvements.
Other niche financing options will be a focus
in 2023, including our medical professional,
first-time homebuyer and zero down payment
mortgages. Additionally, we re making the
closing process more seamless with E-closings
and are preparing to launch the same
convenient online experience for our home
equity loans.
These cumulative efforts to improve all these
solutions, while never complete or done, align
with our mission to create value for customers.
Our business model is designed to expand
and deepen relationships with those in long-standing markets and our recent moves into
southeastern and southcentral Pennsylvania
provide substantial opportunities for new
connections that will drive future growth as well.
Technology Data
As the shift to increasingly digital platforms
accelerates, connecting with our customers via
mobile and desktop apps has become the norm.
I am proud to say that the ways in which our
teams adapted our relationship-based model
to our technological offerings has created new
opportunities to deliver value through convenient
and competitive solutions.
To thrive and advance C N in times of
technological change, our team has assumed the
role of proactive change agents. Enhancements
to our mobile banking app, introduced in
November, gives users an even more seamless
digital experience with conveniently located
navigation buttons and the option for an instant
balance display. We ve also bolstered our
lending capabilities through a lending partnership
with Upstart and a forthcoming lending platform
for small businesses which will streamline the
lending process for our commercial clients.
With a commitment to fostering digital
innovation and delivering scalable solutions, the
C N Technology team has also been hard at
work behind the scenes transforming our data
management capacity, automating key digital
workflows, integrating systems and platforms,
and enabling safe migration to cloud-based
platforms. These projects are just a cross-section of the numerous initiatives that have
allowed us to improve internal productivity this
year, empowering our teams to perform their
roles while serving our customers even more
efficiently, and preparing C N for future growth.
Teams Culture
We re thankful for achievements in so many
areas, but success could not have been
realized without our incredible teammates. The
level of ingenuity, determination and dedication 

President CEO | 07
across this organization is second-to-none as
demonstrated by the overwhelming involvement
in our Giving Back, Giving Together (GBGT)
community fundraising program.
Last May, we closed our Children Youth
campaign, netting over 85,000 in donations
for our local children s services. Since June, our
teams have continued to show unfailing support
for their communities raising just over 70,000
(and counting!) for 34 Local Emergency Services
organizations across the C N footprint. It is
through these community connections that C N
continues to deliver on its mission of creating
value through lifelong relationships. 
The drive to live out our values extends to
strategic integration. As we continue to enhance
our relationship-based business model, C N s
Leadership Team has been pressing forward
plans to equip teammates with productive tools,
resources and systems. Shelley D Haene, our
Chief Digital Channels and Payments Officer,
announced her plans to retire in January of
2023. During the 23 years she dedicated to
C N, Shelley s leadership and engagement
made a lasting contribution to our growth and
support service. Most importantly, she was
a strong voice of support for our people and
culture. Shelley provided excellent transitional
support and guidance to Alex Balagour, our
Chief Information Officer, as he assumed
leadership for C N s Operations, Client Care
Center and Technology departments. We wish
her well in retirement.
We continue to make adjustments designed to
align our structure with our strategy, including
the reorganizing our Talent Development team,
which is focused on attracting and retaining
high-performing teammates and strengthening
our workplace culture. Collectively, these efforts
create a set of integrated functions and systems
that will empower our teams to serve both
internally and externally with greater efficiency.
As we enter our 159th year, C N is positioned to
pursue exciting opportunities amid a challenging
economic, competitive, and regulatory
environment. We know from experience that the
only constant is change and, as we continue
to write the C N story, we re committed to
steadily building and maintaining meaningful
relationships that will stand the test of time and
create long-term value for our shareholders.
Thank you for your ongoing support and we look
forward to continuing our connection with you in
the year ahead.

Community Commitment

At C N, we believe financial wellness
should be a holistic approach to managing
finances that encompasses decision-making, effective money management,
and achieving short-term and long-term
financial goals. It is critical for individuals
of all ages and life stages to have access
to the tools and resources they need
to make informed decisions along their
journey to optimal financial health.
Our C N teammates play a vital role in
helping their customers and communities
achieve financial wellness. They are
dedicated to providing comprehensive
expertise, support and resources to help
individuals reach their financial goals.
In 2022, our teammates visited local
high schools and elementary schools,
giving 37 presentations reaching over
1,200 kids and teens. Their efforts to
educate and support their communities
have shown remarkable results, with a
substantial number of customers who are
taking advantage of our online financial
education resources, such as our
interactive library, which had over 13,000
unique visitors. Additionally, over 100
students used the interactive financial
game, spending a total of 157 hours
playing and advancing their financial
knowledge.
Financial instability can have a strong
emotional and practical toll on individuals
and their families. Our goal is to help create
a brighter future for our communities by
providing the tools and resources needed
to achieve financial wellness.
Financial wellness is not just about
individuals but also about the overall
health and prosperity of communities.
Based on this belief and the desire of our
C N teammates to do more, the Giving
Back, Giving Together program was
born.
From June 2021 to May 2022, C N s teams
partnered with 22 children s services
organizations and raised over 85,000 in
monetary donations to ensure that local

kids have access to essentials such as
proper food, clothing, and shelter.
Our teammates recognize the importance
of supporting these causes with more
than just money. They have taken
a multi-faceted approach to make a
difference by volunteering alongside
these organizations and collecting over
4,600 essential items to help these
organizations fulfill their missions.
Working together with these local
services to provide food, clothing, and
shelter to children is vital to ensuring that
they have the basic necessities to live
and grow. These services are crucial in
breaking the cycle of poverty and helping
children to reach their full potential.
In June 2022, C N s teammates shifted
their focus to supporting 34 local
emergency services organizations, such
as fire and rescue departments, which play
a critical role in keeping communities safe
and secure. These organizations provide
critical support in times of need and help

of fire departments in PA 90.2 in

to protect community members from
harm. By supporting this cause, C N is
not only helping individuals and families
in need but also strengthening the overall
fabric of our communities. Since June,
C N s teams have raised over 70,000,
donated over 2,800 essential items, and
volunteered over 200 hours to support
the work of these organizations.
C N s Giving Back, Giving Together 
program and financial wellness initiatives
underscore our commitment to providing
financial wellness for all. Our hope is to
not only assist individuals and families
in need but also to strengthen the
overall well-being of our communities.
We believe that by working together,
we can create a brighter and more
