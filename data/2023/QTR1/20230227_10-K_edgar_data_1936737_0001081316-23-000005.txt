PACIFICORP 
 
 General 
 
 PacifiCorp, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is a U.S. regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon that serves approximately 2.0 million retail electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. PacifiCorp is principally engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electricity. PacifiCorp's combined service territory covers approximately 141,500 square miles and includes diverse regional economies across six states. No single segment of the economy dominates the combined service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp's exposure to economic fluctuations. In the eastern portion of the service territory, consisting of Utah, Wyoming and southeastern Idaho, the principal industries are manufacturing, mining or extraction of natural resources, agriculture, technology, recreation and government. In the western portion of the service territory, consisting of Oregon, southern Washington and northern California, the principal industries are agriculture, manufacturing, forest products, food processing, technology, government and primary metals. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp buys and sells electricity on the wholesale market with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants to balance and optimize the economic benefits of electricity generation, retail customer loads and existing wholesale transactions. Certain PacifiCorp subsidiaries support its electric utility operations by providing coal mining services. 
 
 PacifiCorp's operations are conducted under numerous franchise agreements, certificates, permits and licenses obtained from federal, state and local authorities. The average term of the franchise agreements is approximately 22 years. Several of these franchise agreements allow the municipality the right to seek amendment to the franchise agreement at a specified time during the term. PacifiCorp generally has an exclusive right to serve electric customers within its service territories and, in turn, has an obligation to provide electric service to those customers. In return, the state utility commissions have established rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow PacifiCorp an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. 
 
 PacifiCorp was incorporated under the laws of the state of Oregon in 1989 and its principal executive offices are located at 825 N.E. Multnomah Street, Suite 1900 Portland, Oregon 97232, its telephone number is (888) 221-7070 and its internet address is www.pacificorp.com. PacifiCorp delivers electricity to customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho under the trade name Rocky Mountain Power and to customers in Oregon, Washington and California under the trade name Pacific Power. 
 
 All shares of PacifiCorp's common stock are indirectly owned by BHE. PacifiCorp also has shares of preferred stock outstanding that are subject to voting rights in certain limited circumstances.

 (1) All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased. 
 
 PacifiCorp is required to have resources available to continuously meet its customer needs and reliably operate its electric system. The percentage of PacifiCorp's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational, economic and environmental factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, legislative considerations, transmission constraints and wholesale market prices of electricity. PacifiCorp evaluates these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of its generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, PacifiCorp places more reliance on other energy sources. For example, PacifiCorp can generate more electricity using its low-cost wind-powered and hydroelectric generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. In addition to meeting its customers' energy needs, PacifiCorp is required to maintain operating reserves on its system to mitigate the impacts of unplanned outages or other disruption in supply, and to meet intra-hour changes in load and resource balance. This operating reserve requirement is dispersed across PacifiCorp's generation portfolio on a least-cost basis based on the operating characteristics of the portfolio. Operating reserves may be held on hydroelectric, coal-fueled, natural gas-fueled or certain types of interruptible load. PacifiCorp manages certain risks relating to its supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives and may include forwards, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and to PacifiCorp's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts. 
 
 Coal 
 
 PacifiCorp has interests in coal mines that support its coal-fueled generating facilities and jointly operates the Bridger surface coal mine. The Bridger underground mine ceased coal production in November 2021. These mines supplied 21 , 21 and 16 of PacifiCorp's total coal requirements during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining coal requirements for PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities are acquired through long- and short-term third-party contracts. 
 
 Most of PacifiCorp's coal reserves are held through agreements with the federal Bureau of Land Management and from certain states and private parties. The agreements generally have multi-year terms that may be renewed or extended and require payment of rents and royalties. In addition, federal and state regulations require that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of mining operations and upon completion of mining activities. 
 
 Coal reserve estimates are subject to adjustment as a result of the development of additional engineering and geological data, new mining technology and changes in regulation and economic factors affecting the utilization of such reserves. 
 
 Recoverability by surface mining methods typically ranges from 90 to 95 . To meet applicable standards, PacifiCorp blends its coal with contracted coal and utilizes emissions reduction technologies for controlling SO 2 and other emissions. For fuel needs at PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in excess of coal reserves available, PacifiCorp believes it will be able to purchase coal under both long- and short-term contracts to supply its generating facilities over their currently expected remaining useful lives. 
 
 6 

Natural Gas 
 
 PacifiCorp uses natural gas as fuel for its generating facilities that use combined-cycle, simple-cycle and steam turbines. Oil and natural gas are also used for igniter fuel and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet PacifiCorp's needs. 
 
 PacifiCorp enters into forward natural gas purchases at fixed or indexed market prices. PacifiCorp purchases natural gas in the spot market with both fixed and indexed market prices for physical delivery to fulfill any fuel requirements not already satisfied through forward purchases of natural gas and sells natural gas in the spot market for the disposition of any excess supply if the forecasted requirements of its natural gas-fueled generating facilities decrease. PacifiCorp also utilizes financial swap contracts to mitigate price risk associated with its forecasted fuel requirements. 
 
 Wind 
 
 PacifiCorp has pursued renewable resources as a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Renewable resources have low to no emissions and require little or no fossil fuel. The generation from PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating fleet, comprised of newly constructed and recently repowered wind-powered generating facilities, qualifies for 100 of the federal PTCs available for 10 years from the date the equipment is placed in-service. In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding repowering activities, refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Hydroelectric and Other Renewable Resources 
 
 The amount of electricity PacifiCorp is able to generate from its hydroelectric generating facilities depends on a number of factors, including snowpack in the mountains upstream of its hydroelectric generating facilities, reservoir storage, precipitation in its watersheds, generating unit availability and restrictions imposed by oversight bodies due to competing water management objectives. 
 
 PacifiCorp operates the majority of its hydroelectric generating portfolio under long-term licenses. The FERC regulates 98 of the net capacity of this portfolio through 14 individual licenses, which have terms of 30 to 50 years. The licenses for these hydroelectric generating facilities expire at various dates through 2061. A portion of this portfolio is licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. For discussion of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric relicensing activities, including updated information regarding the Klamath River hydroelectric system, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Wholesale Activities 
 
 PacifiCorp purchases and sells electricity in the wholesale markets as needed to balance its generation with its retail load obligations. PacifiCorp may also purchase electricity in the wholesale markets when it is more economical than generating electricity from its own facilities and may sell surplus electricity in the wholesale markets when it can do so economically. When prudent, PacifiCorp enters into financial swap contracts and forward electricity sales and purchases for physical delivery at fixed prices to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility.

Energy Imbalance Market 
 
 PacifiCorp and the California ISO implemented an EIM in November 2014, which reduces costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, more effectively integrates renewables and enhances reliability through improved situational awareness and responsiveness. The EIM expands the real-time component of the California ISO's market technology to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the EIM footprint. The EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western U.S. EIM market participants submit bids to the California ISO market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM footprint, utilities in the western U.S. do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits are expected to increase further with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM, bringing incremental resource diversity. In December 2022, PacifiCorp announced its intention to join the California ISO Extended Day-Ahead Market in 2024. 
 
 Transmission and Distribution 
 
 PacifiCorp operates one balancing authority area in the western portion of its service territory ("PacifiCorp-West") and one balancing authority area in the eastern portion of its service territory ("PacifiCorp-East"). A balancing authority area is a geographic area with transmission systems that control generation to maintain schedules with other balancing authority areas and ensure reliable operations. In operating the balancing authority areas, PacifiCorp is responsible for continuously balancing electricity supply and demand by dispatching generating resources and interchange transactions so that generation internal to the balancing authority area, plus net imported power, matches customer loads. Deliveries of energy over PacifiCorp's transmission system are managed and scheduled in accordance with the FERC's requirements. 
 
 PacifiCorp's transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, which includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. PacifiCorp's transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables PacifiCorp to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customer load requirements. PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 17,100 miles of transmission lines in 10 states, 65,300 miles of distribution lines and 900 substations as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution system is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. Portions of PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems are located: 
 On property owned or used through agreements by PacifiCorp; 
 Under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state and federal lands under franchises, easements or other rights that are generally subject to termination; 
 Under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the title holder of record; or 
 Under or over Native American reservations through agreements with the U.S. Secretary of Interior or Native American tribes. 
 
 It is possible that some of the easements and the property over which the easements were granted may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired.

PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission Expansion Program represents plans to build over 2,000 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, with an estimated cost of approximately 11 billion, primarily in Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Oregon. The approximately 11 billion estimated cost includes: (a) the 135-mile, 345-kV transmission line between the Terminal substation near the Salt Lake City Airport and the Populus substation in Downey, Idaho, placed in-service in 2010; (b) the 100-mile, 345/500-kV transmission line between the Mona substation in central Utah and the Oquirrh substation in the Salt Lake Valley, placed in-service in 2013; (c) the 170-mile, 345-kV transmission line between the Sigurd substation in central Utah and the Red Butte substation in southwest Utah, placed in-service in 2015; (d) the 140-mile, 500-kV transmission line between the Aeolus substation near Medicine Bow, Wyoming and the Jim Bridger generating facility, placed in-service in 2020; (e) the 416-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Aeolus substation and the Clover substation near Mona, Utah, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; (f) the 59-mile, 230-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Windstar substation near Glenrock, Wyoming and the Aeolus substation, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; (g) the 290-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Longhorn substation near Boardman, Oregon to the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho (a joint project), expected to be placed in-service in 2026; (h) the 14-mile, 345-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Oquirrh substation and the Terminal substation, expected to be placed in-service in 2024; and (i) remaining segments that are expected to be placed in-service in future years, depending on load growth, economic analysis, IRP results, siting, permitting and construction schedules. The transmission line segments are intended to: (a) address customer load growth; (b) improve system reliability; (c) reduce transmission system constraints; (d) provide access to diverse generation resources, including renewable and zero carbon resources; and (e) improve the flow of electricity throughout PacifiCorp's six-state service area. Proposed transmission line segments are evaluated to ensure optimal benefits and timing before committing to move forward with permitting and construction. Through December 31, 2022, 3.8 billion had been spent and 2.3 billion, including AFUDC, had been placed in-service. 
 
 Future Generation, Conservation and Energy Efficiency 
 
 Energy Supply Planning 
 
 As required by certain state regulations, PacifiCorp uses an IRP to develop a long-term resource plan to ensure that PacifiCorp can continue to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to its customers while maintaining compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations. The IRP process identifies the amount and timing of PacifiCorp's expected future resource needs, accounting for planning uncertainty, risks, reliability, state energy policies and other factors. The IRP is prepared following a public process, which provides an opportunity for stakeholders to participate in PacifiCorp's resource planning process. PacifiCorp files its IRP biennially with the state commissions in each of the six states where PacifiCorp operates. Five states indicate whether the IRP meets the state commission's IRP standards and guidelines, a process referred to as "acknowledgment" in some states. Acknowledgment by a state commission does not address recovery or prudency of resources ultimately selected. 
 
 In September 2021, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 IRP with its state commissions and subsequently filed its 2021 IRP Update in March and April 2022. In March 2022, the OPUC acknowledged PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP and its preferred portfolio. In June 2022, the UPSC issued an order declining to acknowledge the 2021 IRP due to its determination that PacifiCorp did not meet the commission's IRP guidelines by excluding new natural gas-fueled resources in its modeling of the 2021 IRP's preferred portfolio, as well as the commission's view that PacifiCorp did not provide ample time for public input and information exchange during the development of the IRP. The UPSC did approve the 2022 All Source RFP ("2022AS RFP") to procure resources identified in the 2021 IRP. In August 2022, the IPUC acknowledged PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP and its preferred portfolio. Reviews of the 2021 IRP by the WPSC and the WUTC are ongoing. 
 
 The 2021 IRP includes investments in new renewable energy resources, new battery storage resources, expanded transmission investments and advanced nuclear resources. New renewable energy resources in the IRP include more than 1,800 MWs of new wind-powered generation, over 2,100 MWs of new solar-powered generation and nearly 700 MWs of new battery storage capacity by 2025. The IRP also outlines PacifiCorp's plan to retire or convert to natural gas all coal-fueled resources by 2042. 
 
 Requests for Proposals 
 
 PacifiCorp issues individual RFPs, each of which typically focuses on a specific category of generation resources consistent with the IRP or other customer-driven demands. The IRP and the RFPs provide for the identification and staged procurement of resources to meet load and state specific compliance obligations. Depending upon the specific RFP, applicable laws and regulations may require PacifiCorp to file draft RFPs with the UPSC, the OPUC and the WUTC. Approval by the UPSC, the OPUC or the WUTC may be required depending on the nature of the RFPs. 
 
 9 

A draft of PacifiCorp's 2022AS RFP was approved by the WUTC in March 2022 and by the UPSC and the OPUC in April 2022. The 2022AS RFP was issued to market in April 2022. PacifiCorp-owned bids were due late November 2022 and market bids are due February 2023. PacifiCorp expects to provide a recommended final shortlist for state commission and independent evaluator consideration by late June 2023. 
 
 Energy Efficiency Programs 
 
 PacifiCorp has provided its customers with a comprehensive set of DSM programs since the 1970s. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. PacifiCorp offers services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, PacifiCorp offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for energy project management, efficient building operations and efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to solicit participation in load management programs by residential, business and agricultural customers through programs such as PacifiCorp's residential and small commercial air conditioner load control program, battery control program and irrigation equipment load control programs. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for recovery of costs incurred for the DSM programs through state-specific energy efficiency surcharges to retail customers or for recovery of costs through rates. During 2022, PacifiCorp spent 167 million on these DSM programs, resulting in an estimated 514,928 MWhs of first-year energy savings and an estimated 432 MWs of peak load management. In addition to these DSM programs, PacifiCorp has load curtailment contracts with a number of large industrial customers that deliver up to 372 MWs of load reduction when needed, depending on the customers' actual operations. Costs associated with the large industrial load curtailment program are captured in the respective customers' retail special contracts. The corresponding recovery of costs was approved by the respective state commissions or through PacifiCorp's general rate case process.

 14 

MidAmerican Energy is required to have accredited resources available for dispatch by MISO to continuously meet its customer's needs and reliably operate its electric system. The percentage of MidAmerican Energy's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, environmental considerations, transmission constraints, and wholesale market prices of electricity. MidAmerican Energy evaluates these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of its generating facilities by MISO. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy places more reliance on other energy sources. For example, MidAmerican Energy can generate more electricity using its low cost wind-powered generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. When factors associated with wind resources are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy must increase its reliance on more expensive generation or purchased electricity. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction. 
 
 Wind 
 
 MidAmerican Energy owns more wind-powered generating capacity than any other U.S. rate-regulated electric utility and believes wind-powered generation offers a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Pursuant to ratemaking principles approved by the IUB, facilities accounting for 92 of MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating capacity in-service at December 31, 2022, are authorized to earn over their regulatory lives a fixed rate of return on equity ranging from 11.0 to 12.2 on the depreciated cost of their original construction, which excludes the cost of later replacements, in any future Iowa rate proceeding. MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities, including those facilities where a significant portion of the equipment was replaced, commonly referred to as repowered facilities, are eligible for federal renewable electricity PTCs for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying wind-powered generating facilities is produced and sold. PTCs for MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities currently in-service began expiring in 2014, with final expiration in 2032. Since 2014, MidAmerican Energy has repowered, or plans to repower, 2,204 MWs of wind-powered generating facilities for which PTCs had expired by the end of 2022. 
 
 Of the 7,414 MWs (nameplate capacity) of wind-powered generating facilities in-service as of December 31, 2022, 7,249 MWs were generating PTCs, including 2,310 MWs of repowered facilities. PTCs earned by MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service prior to 2013, except for repowered facilities, were included in MidAmerican Energy's Iowa EAC, through which MidAmerican Energy is allowed to recover fluctuations in its electric retail energy costs. All of the eligibility of those facilities to earn PTCs had expired by the end of 2022. MidAmerican Energy earned PTCs totaling 710 million, 574 million and 510 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which 4 , 12 and 15 , respectively, were included in the Iowa EAC. 
 
 Coal 
 
 All of the coal-fueled generating facilities operated by MidAmerican Energy are fueled by low-sulfur, western coal from the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio includes multiple suppliers and mines under short-term and multi-year agreements of varying terms and quantities through 2027. MidAmerican Energy believes supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio has substantially all of its expected 2023 and a majority of 2024 requirements under fixed-price contracts. MidAmerican Energy regularly monitors the western coal market for opportunities to enhance its coal supply portfolio. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company ("BNSF"), an affiliate company, for the delivery of coal to all of the MidAmerican Energy-operated coal-fueled generating facilities other than the George Neal Energy Center. Under this agreement, BNSF delivers coal directly to MidAmerican Energy's Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center and to an interchange point with Canadian Pacific Railway Company for short-haul delivery to the Louisa Energy Center. MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with Union Pacific Railroad Company for the delivery of coal to the George Neal Energy Center. 
 
 15 

Nuclear 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is a 25 joint owner of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 ("Quad Cities Station"), a nuclear generating facility, which is currently licensed by the NRC for operation until December 14, 2032. Constellation Energy Generation, LLC ("Constellation Energy"), is the 75 joint owner and the operator of Quad Cities Station. Approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel assemblies in each reactor core at Quad Cities Station is replaced every 24 months. MidAmerican Energy has been advised by Constellation Energy that it does not anticipate it will have difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of Quad Cities Station. In reaction to concerns about the profitability of Quad Cities Station and Constellation Energy's ability to continue its operation, in December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. Currently, Quad Cities is operating under agreements to provide Illinois load serving entities ZECs through June 1, 2027. 
 
 Natural Gas and Other 
 
 MidAmerican Energy uses natural gas and oil as fuel for intermediate and peak demand electric generation, igniter fuel, transmission support and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. 
 
 Regional Transmission Organizations 
 
 MidAmerican Energy sells and purchases electricity and ancillary services related to its generation and load in wholesale markets pursuant to the tariffs in those markets. MidAmerican Energy participates predominantly in the MISO energy and ancillary service markets, which provide MidAmerican Energy with wholesale opportunities over a large market area. MidAmerican Energy can enter into wholesale bilateral transactions in addition to market activity related to its assets. MidAmerican Energy is also authorized to participate in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. markets and can contract with several other utilities in the region. MidAmerican Energy utilizes financial swaps and physical fixed-price electricity sales and purchases contracts to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's decisions regarding additions to or reductions of its generation portfolio may be impacted by the MISO's minimum reserve margin requirement. The MISO requires each member to maintain a minimum reserve margin of its accredited generating capacity over its peak demand obligation based on the member's load forecast filed with the MISO each year. The MISO's reserve requirement was 8.7 for the summer of 2022. MidAmerican Energy's owned and contracted capacity accredited for the 2022-2023 MISO capacity auction was 5,591 MWs compared to a peak demand obligation of 5,078 MWs, or a reserve margin of 10.1 . Beginning with the 2023-2024 planning year, the MISO will implement a seasonal construct requiring each member to maintain a minimum seasonal reserve margin of its accredited generating capacity over its seasonal peak demand obligation based on the member's seasonal load forecast filed with the MISO each year. The reserve requirements for the 2023-2024 planning year will be 7.4 for summer 2023, 14.9 for fall 2023, 25.5 for winter 2023-2024 and 24.5 for spring 2024. Accredited capacity represents the amount of generation available to meet the requirements of MidAmerican Energy's retail customers and consists of MidAmerican Energy-owned generation, interruptible retail customer load, certain customer private generation that MidAmerican Energy is contractually allowed to dispatch and the net amount of capacity purchases and sales, excluding sales into the MISO annual capacity auction. Accredited capacity may vary significantly from the nominal capacity ratings, particularly for wind or solar facilities whose output is dependent upon energy resource availability at any given time. Additionally, the actual amount of generating capacity available at any time may be less than the accredited capacity due to regulatory restrictions, transmission constraints, fuel restrictions and generating units being temporarily out of service for inspection, maintenance, refueling, modifications or other reasons.

 MidAmerican Energy's transmission and distribution systems included 4,600 circuit miles of transmission lines in four states, 25,400 circuit miles of distribution lines and 345 substations as of December 31, 2022. Electricity from MidAmerican Energy's generating facilities and purchased electricity is delivered to wholesale markets and its retail customers via the transmission facilities of MidAmerican Energy and others. MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO capacity, energy and ancillary services markets as a transmission-owning member and, accordingly, operates its transmission assets at the direction of the MISO. The MISO manages its energy and ancillary service markets using reliability-constrained economic dispatch of the region's generation. For both the day-ahead and real-time (every five minutes) markets, the MISO analyzes generation commitments to provide market liquidity and transparent pricing while maintaining transmission system reliability by minimizing congestion and maximizing efficient energy transmission. Additionally, through its FERC-approved OATT, the MISO performs the role of transmission service provider throughout the MISO footprint and administers the long-term planning function. The MISO costs of the participants are shared among the participants through a number of mechanisms in accordance with the MISO tariff. 
 
 Regulated Natural Gas Operations 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territory and the related procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas for the benefit of those customers. MidAmerican Energy purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the gas to MidAmerican Energy's service territory and for storage and balancing services. MidAmerican Energy sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2022, 54 of the total natural gas delivered through MidAmerican Energy's distribution system was associated with transportation service. 
 
 Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and service lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of MidAmerican Energy included 24,600 miles of natural gas main and service lines as of December 31, 2022.

 (1) Commercial and industrial customers are classified primarily based on the nature of their business and natural gas usage. Commercial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas principally for heating. Industrial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas principally for their manufacturing processes. 
 (2) Wholesale sales are generally made to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies for eventual resale to end-use customers. 
 
 There are seasonal variations in MidAmerican Energy's regulated natural gas business that are principally due to the use of natural gas for heating. Typically, 50-60 of MidAmerican Energy's regulated retail natural gas revenue is reported in the months of January, February, March and December. 
 
 On January 29, 2019, MidAmerican Energy recorded its all-time highest peak-day delivery through its distribution system of 1,319,361 Dths. This peak-day delivery consisted of 68 traditional retail sales service and 32 transportation service. MidAmerican Energy's 2022/2023 winter heating season preliminary peak-day delivery as of February 2, 2023, was 1,311,920 Dths, reached on December 22, 2022. This preliminary peak-day delivery consisted of 71 traditional retail sales service and 29 transportation service. 
 
 Natural Gas Supply and Capacity 
 
 MidAmerican Energy uses several strategies designed to maintain a reliable natural gas supply and reduce the impact of volatility in natural gas prices on its regulated retail natural gas customers. These strategies include the purchase of a geographically diverse supply portfolio from producers and third-party energy marketing companies, the use of interstate pipeline storage services and MidAmerican Energy's LNG peaking facilities, and the use of financial derivatives to fix the price on a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements of MidAmerican Energy's customers. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the PGAs. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy contracts for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from key production areas and liquid market centers to its service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Northern Natural Gas, an affiliate company. MidAmerican Energy has multiple pipeline interconnections into several larger markets within its distribution system. Multiple pipeline interconnections create competition among pipeline suppliers for transportation capacity to serve those markets, thus reducing costs. In addition, multiple pipeline interconnections increase delivery reliability and give MidAmerican Energy the ability to optimize delivery of the lowest cost supply from the various production areas and liquid market centers into these markets. Benefits to MidAmerican Energy's distribution system customers are shared among all jurisdictions through a consolidated PGA. 
 
 At times, the natural gas pipeline capacity available through MidAmerican Energy's firm capacity portfolio may exceed the requirements of retail customers on MidAmerican Energy's distribution system. Firm capacity in excess of MidAmerican Energy's system needs can be released to other companies to achieve optimum use of the available capacity. Past IUB and South Dakota Public Utilities Commission ("SDPUC") rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 30 of the revenue on the resold capacity, with the remaining 70 being returned to customers through the PGAs. 
 
 18 

MidAmerican Energy utilizes interstate pipeline natural gas storage services to meet retail customer requirements, manage fluctuations in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors and manage variation in seasonal natural gas pricing. MidAmerican Energy typically withdraws natural gas from storage during the heating season when customer demand is historically at its peak and injects natural gas into storage during off-peak months when customer demand is historically lower. MidAmerican Energy also utilizes its three LNG facilities to meet peak day demands during the winter heating season. Interstate pipeline storage services and MidAmerican Energy's LNG facilities reduce dependence on natural gas purchases during the volatile winter heating season and can deliver a significant portion of MidAmerican Energy's anticipated retail sales requirements on a peak winter day. For MidAmerican Energy's 2022/2023 winter heating season preliminary peak-day of December 22, 2022, supply sources used to meet deliveries to traditional retail sales service customers included 54 from purchases delivered on interstate pipelines, 35 from interstate pipeline storage services and 11 from MidAmerican Energy's LNG facilities. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy attempts to optimize the value of its regulated transportation capacity, natural gas supply and interstate pipeline storage services by engaging in wholesale transactions. IUB and SDPUC rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 50 of the respective jurisdictional margins earned on certain wholesale sales of natural gas, with the remaining 50 being returned to customers through the PGAs. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is not aware of any factors that would cause material difficulties in meeting its anticipated retail customer demand under normal operating conditions for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Energy Efficiency Programs 
 
 MidAmerican Energy has provided a comprehensive set of demand- and energy-reduction programs to its Iowa electric and natural gas customers since 1990. The programs, collectively referred to as energy efficiency programs, are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, MidAmerican Energy offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. In Iowa, legislation passed in 2018 provides that projected cumulative average annual costs for a natural gas energy efficiency plan cannot exceed 1.5 of expected Iowa natural gas retail revenue and, for an electric demand response plan and separately for an electric energy efficiency plan other than demand response, cannot exceed 2.0 of expected annual Iowa electric retail revenue. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for contemporaneous recovery of costs incurred for energy efficiency programs through state-specific energy efficiency service charges paid by all retail electric and natural gas customers. In 2022, 43 million was expensed for MidAmerican Energy's energy efficiency programs, which resulted in estimated first-year energy savings of 133,000 MWhs of electricity and 174,000 Dths of natural gas and an estimated peak load reduction of 384 MWs of electricity and 2,444 Dths per day of natural gas.

 Variations in weather, economic conditions, particularly for gaming, mining and wholesale customers and various conservation, energy efficiency and private generation measures and programs can impact customer energy requirements. Wholesale sales are impacted by market prices for energy relative to the incremental cost to generate power. 
 
 There are seasonal variations in the Nevada Utilities' electric business that are principally related to weather and the related use of electricity for air conditioning. Typically, 48-52 of Nevada Power's and 37-40 of Sierra Pacific's regulated electric revenue is reported in the months of June through September. 
 
 21 

The annual hourly peak customer demand on the Nevada Utilities' electric systems occurs as a result of air conditioning use during the cooling season. Peak demand represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour. On July 11, 2022, customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 6,033 MWs on Nevada Power's electric system, which is 267 MWs less than the record hourly peak demand of 6,300 MWs set July 9, 2021. On July 27, 2022, customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 1,962 MWs on Sierra Pacific's electric system, which is 144 MWs less than the record hourly peak demand of 2,106 MWs set July 12, 2021.

The following table shows the percentages of the Nevada Utilities' total energy supplied by energy source for the years ended December 31: 
 2022 2021 2020 Nevada Power: Total energy generated - natural gas 60 64 66 Energy purchased - long-term contracts (renewable) (1) 
 23 19 15 Energy purchased - long-term contracts (non-renewable) 9 10 13 Energy purchased - short-term contracts and other 8 7 6 100 100 100 Sierra Pacific: Natural gas 41 43 48 Coal 11 11 8 Total energy generated 52 54 56 Energy purchased - long-term contracts (renewable) (1) 
 28 17 15 Energy purchased - long-term contracts (non-renewable) 11 14 24 Energy purchased - short-term contracts and other 9 15 5 100 100 100 
 (1) All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these sources may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased. 
 
 The Nevada Utilities are required to have resources available to continuously meet their customer needs and reliably operate their electric systems. The percentage of the Nevada Utilities' energy supplied by energy source varies from year-to-year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages; fuel commodity prices; fuel transportation costs; weather; environmental considerations; transmission constraints; and wholesale market prices of electricity. The Nevada Utilities evaluate these factors continuously in order to facilitate economic dispatch of their generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, the Nevada Utilities place more reliance on other energy sources. As long as the Nevada Utilities' purchases are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through their annual prudency review, the Nevada Utilities are permitted to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power. The Nevada Utilities also have the ability to reset quarterly the BTERs, with PUCN approval, based on the last 12 months fuel costs and purchased power and to reset quarterly DEAA. 
 
 The Nevada Utilities have adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements. The first element is a set of management guidelines for procuring and optimizing the supply portfolio that is consistent with the requirements of a load serving entity with a full requirements obligation, and with the growth of private generation serving a small but growing group of customers with partial requirements. The second element is an energy risk management and control approach that ensures clear separation of roles between the day-to-day management of risks and compliance monitoring and control and ensures clear distinction between policy setting (or planning) and execution. Lastly, the Nevada Utilities pursue a process of ongoing regulatory involvement and acknowledgment of the resource portfolio management plans. 
 
 The Nevada Utilities have entered into multiple long-term power purchase contracts (three or more years) with suppliers that generate electricity utilizing renewable resources and natural gas. Nevada Power has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 3,522 MWs with contract termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2067. Included in these contracts are 3,352 MWs of capacity from renewable energy, of which 1,818 MWs of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available. Sierra Pacific has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 985 MWs with contract termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2049. Included in these contracts are 973 MWs of capacity from renewable energy, of which 25 MWs of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available. 
 
 The Nevada Utilities manage certain risks relating to their supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to NV Energy's "General Regulation" section in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and Nevada Power's Item 7A and Sierra Pacific's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts. 
 
 23 

Natural Gas 
 
 The Nevada Utilities rely on indexed physical gas purchases for the majority of natural gas needed to operate their generating facilities. To secure natural gas supplies for the generating facilities, the Nevada Utilities execute purchases pursuant to a PUCN approved four season laddering strategy. In 2022, natural gas supply net purchases averaged 299,831 and 149,418 Dths per day with the winter period contracts averaging 256,039 and 120,985 Dths per day and the summer period contracts averaging 330,731 and 189,714 Dths per day for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific, respectively. The Nevada Utilities believe supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet its needs. 
 
 The Nevada Utilities contract for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from production areas to their service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Nevada Power who contracts with Kern River, an affiliated company. Sierra Pacific utilizes natural gas storage contracted from interstate pipelines to meet retail customer requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors. The stored natural gas is typically replaced during off-peak months when the demand for natural gas is historically lower than during the heating season. 
 
 Coal 
 
 Sierra Pacific relies on spot market solicitations for coal supplies and will regularly monitor the western coal market for opportunities to meet these needs. Sierra Pacific has a transportation services contract with Union Pacific Railroad Company to ship coal from various origins in central Utah, western Colorado and Wyoming that expires December 31, 2025. Sierra Pacific has a coal purchase agreement that extends through December 2023. The Valmy generating facility, Sierra Pacific's remaining facility requiring coal, has an approved retirement date of December 2025. Nevada Power has no coal requirements. 
 
 Energy Imbalance Market 
 
 The Nevada Utilities participate in the EIM operated by the California ISO, which reduces costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, more effectively integrates renewables and enhances reliability through improved situational awareness and responsiveness. The EIM expands the real-time component of the California ISO's market technology to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the EIM footprint. The EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western U.S. EIM market participants submit bids to the California ISO market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM footprint, utilities in the western U.S. do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits are expected to increase further with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM bringing incremental diversity. 
 
 Transmission and Distribution 
 
 The Nevada Utilities' transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, a regional grid in the U.S. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. The Nevada Utilities' transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Nevada Utilities to integrate and access generation resources to meet their customer load requirements. Nevada Power's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 1,900 miles of transmission lines, 14,000 miles of distribution lines and 220 substations as of December 31, 2022. Sierra Pacific's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 4,200 miles of transmission lines, 9,600 miles of distribution lines and 210 substations as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 24 

ON Line is a 231-mile, 500-kV transmission line connecting Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's service territories. ON Line provides the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout Nevada and provide access to renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern Nevada, which enhances the Nevada Utilities' ability to manage and optimize their generating facilities. ON Line provides between 600 MWs northbound and 900 MWs southbound of transfer capability with interconnection between the Robinson Summit substation on the Sierra Pacific system and the Harry Allen substation on the Nevada Power system. ON Line was a joint project between the Nevada Utilities and Great Basin Transmission, LLC. The Nevada Utilities own a 25 interest in ON Line and have entered into a long-term transmission use agreement with Great Basin Transmission, LLC for its 75 interest in ON Line until 2054. The Nevada Utilities share of its 25 interest in ON Line and the long-term transmission use agreement is split 75 for Nevada Power and 25 for Sierra Pacific. 
 
 The PUCN has approved the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program, with an estimated cost of approximately 2.6 billion, which builds a foundation for the Nevada Utilities to accommodate existing and future transmission network customers, increase transmission system reliability, create access to diversified renewable resources, facilitate development of existing designated solar energy zones, facilitate conventional generation retirement and achieve Nevada's carbon reduction and eventual net-zero objectives. The Greenlink program consists of a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. The Greenlink program will be constructed in stages that are estimated to be placed in-service between December 2026 and December 2028. The Nevada Utilities will jointly own and operate the Greenlink transmission lines. Through December 31, 2022, 51 million had been spent. 
 
 Future Generation, Conservation and Energy Efficiency 
 
 Energy Supply Planning 
 
 Within the energy supply planning process, there are four key components covering different time frames: 
 
 IRPs are filed by the Nevada Utilities for approval by the PUCN every three years and the Nevada Utilities may, as necessary, file amendments to their IRPs. IRPs are prepared in compliance with Nevada laws and regulations and cover a 20-year period. Nevada law governing the IRP process was modified in 2017 and now requires joint filings by Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific. IRPs develop a comprehensive, integrated plan that considers customer energy requirements and propose the resources to meet those requirements in a manner that is consistent with prevailing market fundamentals. The ultimate goal of the IRPs is to balance the objectives of minimizing costs and reducing volatility while reliably meeting the electric needs of the Nevada Utilities' customers. Costs incurred to complete projects approved through the IRP process still remain subject to review for reasonableness by the PUCN. 
 Energy Supply Plans ("ESP") are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP. The ESP has a one- to three-year planning horizon and is an intermediate-term resource procurement and risk management plan that establishes the supply portfolio strategies within which intermediate-term resource requirements will be met with PUCN approval required for executing contracts of longer than three years. 
 Distributed Resource Plans ("DRP") are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP. The DRP establishes a formal process to aid in the cost-effective integration of distributed resources into the Nevada Utilities' distribution and transmission process and ultimately the NV Energy utilities' electricity grid. 
 Action plans are filed with the PUCN for approval and operate in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP and PUCN-approved ESP. The action plan establishes tactical execution activities with a three-year focus. 
 
 25 

In June 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed a joint application for approval of their 2022-2041 Triennial IRP, 2022-2024 ESP and 2022-2024 Action Plan. As part of the filing, the Nevada Utilities requested approval of 600 MWs of solar photovoltaic generating resources with 480 MWs of battery energy storage capacity, three battery energy storage projects with 66 MWs of capacity, the acquisition of one existing solar photovoltaic generating facility with 19.5 MWs of capacity that is currently leased to Sierra Pacific, and network upgrades associated with the new renewable energy projects. In September 2021, a hearing was held for the generation upgrades portion of the application, which resulted in an order approving that portion of the joint IRP. The Nevada Utilities filed a partial party stipulation resolving all issues related to the ESP, load forecast and fuel and purchased power price portions of the joint IRP. In October 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed a corrected stipulation, which was approved by the PUCN. In November 2021, a hearing was conducted for the remaining portions of the joint IRP and in December 2021, the PUCN issued an order granting in part and denying in part. The PUCN approved the construction of the 600 MWs of solar photovoltaic generating resources with 480 MWs of battery energy storage capacity, the acquisition of the existing solar photovoltaic generating facility and the network upgrade, among other items. However, the three additional battery energy storage projects were deferred for approval in future plans and the PUCN declined to retire Valmy 1 early and made adjustments to the approved budget for developing and conducting the distributed resource energy trial. 
 
 In September 2021, in compliance with Senate Bill ("SB") 448, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for approval of their Transmission Infrastructure for a Clean Energy Economy Plan that sets forth a plan for the construction of certain high-voltage transmission infrastructure which includes a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line known as Greenlink North and a 32-mile, 525-kV transmission segment of Greenlink West. In January 2022, the Nevada Utilities reached a settlement with all the intervening parties and presented a stipulation before the PUCN related to the Greenlink transmission project. The settlement allows for the Nevada Utilities to receive approval to construct the Greenlink North project and the remaining segment of the Greenlink West project. The settlement allows the Nevada Utilities to designate these projects as critical facilities that will allow the Nevada Utilities to propose financial incentives in future proceedings. Potential financial incentives include construction work in process included in rate base and the ability to use regulatory asset accounting treatment. The Nevada Utilities agreed not to seek an enhanced return on investment at the state level as part of the settlement. The stipulation was approved by the PUCN in January 2022. 
 
 In March 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed the first amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for approval of the battery energy storage system with 220 MWs of capacity; a 3.5 million funding request to further study and perform due diligence on the pumped storage hydro project with a capacity of 1,000 MW, an addition of the geothermal facility purchase power agreement for 25 MW of renewable energy, peak firing project upgrades at the existing generating units to yield 48 MW of additional on-peak generation thermal energy storage project to increase the generating station's peak capacity by 18 MW, and network upgrades associated with the battery energy storage system. In April 2022, a partial stipulation was filed to remedy the redaction of the purchase power agreement pricing and in June 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed a settlement stipulation resolving all remaining issues. The PUCN approved the stipulation in July 2022. 
 
 In compliance with SB 448, the Nevada Utilities filed their second and third amendments to the 2021 joint IRP in July and September 2022, respectively. The Nevada Utilities requested an approval to amend the Demand Side Plan for the action period for 2022-2024 in July's filing and requested in September an approval of a DRP amendment to implement the state's first Transportation Electrification Plan ("TEP") and approve proposed tariffs and schedules to implement the TEP. In November 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed an all-party settlement stipulation of the second amendment to the IRP, resolving all issues. A hearing related to the application for approval of the third amendment was held in February 2023. 
 
 In November 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed their fourth amendment to the 2021 joint IRP requesting an approval of a generation update to the Supply Plan, an addition of 400 MW of peaking combustion turbines, a 120 MW geothermal portfolio long-term power purchase agreement, a 20 MW new geothermal technology long-term purchase power agreement, and a 200 MW grid-tied battery energy storage system at the Valmy generating facility as well as necessary transmission upgrades. An order is expected in the first half of 2023. 
 
 26 

Energy Efficiency Programs 
 
 The Nevada Utilities have provided a comprehensive set of energy efficiency, demand response and conservation programs to their Nevada electric customers. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy audits and customer education and awareness efforts that provide information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, the Nevada Utilities have offered rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. Energy efficiency program costs are recovered through annual rates set by the PUCN and adjusted based on the Nevada Utilities' annual filing to recover current program costs and any over or under collections from the prior filing, subject to prudence review. During 2022, Nevada Power spent 34 million on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 205,974 MWhs of electric energy savings and an estimated 179 MWs of electric peak load management. During 2022, Sierra Pacific spent 8 million on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 40,539 MWhs of electric energy savings and an estimated 23 MWs of electric peak load management. 
 
 Regulated Natural Gas Operations 
 
 Sierra Pacific is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territory and the related procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas for the benefit of those customers. Sierra Pacific purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the natural gas from the production areas to Sierra Pacific's service territory and for storage services to manage fluctuations in system demand and seasonal pricing. Sierra Pacific sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for a number of end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2022, 7 of the total natural gas delivered through Sierra Pacific's distribution system was for transportation service. 
 
 Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and service lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of Sierra Pacific included 3,600 miles of natural gas mains and service lines as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Customer Usage and Seasonality 
 
 The percentages of natural gas sold to Sierra Pacific's retail and wholesale customers by class of customer, total Dths of natural gas sold, total Dths of transportation service and the average number of retail customers for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 Residential 55 53 56 Commercial (1) 
 28 28 28 Industrial (1) 
 11 10 10 Total retail 94 91 94 Wholesale (2) 
 6 9 6 100 100 100 Total Dths of natural gas sold (in thousands) 20,622 20,050 18,622 Total Dths of transportation service (in thousands) 1,576 1,850 2,217 Total average number of retail customers (in thousands) 180 177 174 
 
 (1) Commercial and industrial customers are classified primarily based on the nature of their business and natural gas usage. Commercial customers are non-residential customers with monthly gas usage less than 12,000 therms during five consecutive winter months. Industrial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas in excess of 12,000 therms during one or more winter months. 
 
 (2) Wholesale sales are generally made to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies for eventual resale to end-use customers. 
 
 27 

There are seasonal variations in Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas business that are principally due to the use of natural gas for heating. Typically, 47-56 of Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas revenue is reported in the months of December through March. 
 
 On December 18, 2022, Sierra Pacific recorded its highest peak-day natural gas delivery of 152,157 Dths, which is 11,417 Dths less than the record peak-day delivery of 163,574 Dths set on December 9, 2013. This peak-day delivery consisted of 96 traditional retail sales service and 4 transportation service. 
 
 Fuel Supply and Capacity 
 
 The purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas operations is done in combination with the purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations. In response to energy supply challenges, Sierra Pacific has adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements, as discussed earlier under Generating Facilities and Fuel Supply. Similar to Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations, as long as Sierra Pacific's purchases of natural gas are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through its annual prudency review, Sierra Pacific is permitted to recover the cost of natural gas. Sierra Pacific also has the ability, with PUCN approval, to reset quarterly the BTERs, based on the last 12 months fuel costs, and to reset quarterly DEAA.

NORTHERN POWERGRID 
 
 Northern Powergrid, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is a holding company which owns two companies that distribute electricity in Great Britain, Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc. In addition to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, Northern Powergrid also owns a meter asset rental business that leases meters to energy suppliers in the United Kingdom, an engineering contracting business that provides electrical infrastructure contracting services primarily to third parties, a hydrocarbon exploration and development business that is focused on developing integrated upstream gas projects in Europe and Australia and ownership interests in two solar generation facilities in Australia having a total net owned capacity of 260 MWs. 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies serve 4.0 million end-users and operate in the north-east of England from North Northumberland through Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Yorkshire to North Lincolnshire, an area covering 10,000 square miles. The principal function of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies is to build, maintain and operate the electricity distribution network through which the end-user receives a supply of electricity. 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies receive electricity from the national grid transmission system and from generators that are directly connected to the distribution network and distribute it to end-users' premises using their networks of transformers, switchgear and distribution lines and cables. Substantially all of the end-users in the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution service areas are directly or indirectly connected to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' networks and electricity can only be delivered to these end-users through their distribution systems, thus providing the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies with distribution volumes that are relatively stable from year to year. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies charge fees for the use of their distribution systems to the suppliers of electricity. 
 
 28 

The suppliers purchase electricity from generators, sell the electricity to end-user customers and use the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution networks pursuant to an industry standard "Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement." During 2022, E.ON and certain of its affiliates and British Gas Trading Limited represented 22 and 14 , respectively, of the total combined distribution revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies. Variations in demand from end-users can affect the revenues that are received by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies in any year, but such variations have no effect on the total revenue that the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies are allowed to recover in a price control period. Under- or over-recoveries against price-controlled revenues are carried forward into prices for future years. 
 
 During 2021, 28 suppliers went bankrupt due to rising wholesale prices, particularly for natural gas. This resulted in energy supply costs being higher than the Ofgem set variable tariff price cap that can be charged to customers. Any distribution use of system bad debts suffered by Northern Powergrid is recoverable in future distribution use of systems revenue. 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' combined service territory features a diverse economy with no dominant sector. The mix of rural, agricultural, urban and industrial areas covers a broad customer base ranging from domestic usage through farming and retail to major industry including automotives, chemicals, mining, steelmaking and offshore marine construction. The industry within the area is concentrated around the principal centers of Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and Leeds. 
 
 The price-controlled revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies is set out in the special conditions of the licenses of those companies. The licenses are enforced by the regulator, GEMA, through Ofgem, and limit increases to allowed revenues (or may require decreases) based upon the rate of inflation, other specified factors and other regulatory action. The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and will continue through March 31, 2023. Ofgem has set the next price control for the five-year period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2028. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies published and filed their business plans for the next price control period with Ofgem in December 2021 with final determinations published in November 2022. The remaining necessary step for this price control to be effective is the statutory modification of the license, which was published by Ofgem on February 3, 2023 and will become effective on April 1, 2023. 
 
 GWhs and percentages of electricity distributed to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' end-users and the total number of end-users as of and for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 GWhs distributed: Residential 11,880 37 13,334 39 12,946 40 Commercial 3,737 12 3,643 11 3,459 10 Industrial 16,239 50 16,424 49 15,917 49 Other 301 1 318 1 359 1 32,157 100 33,719 100 32,681 100 Number of end-users (in thousands): 3,953 3,941 3,934 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the combined electricity distribution network of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies included approximately 17,000 miles of overhead lines, 43,400 miles of underground cables and 810 major substations.

BHE PIPELINE GROUP (EASTERN ENERGY GAS AND EGTS) 
 
 The BHE Pipeline Group consists of BHE GT S, Northern Natural Gas and Kern River, each an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE. The BHE Pipeline Group operates approximately 21,200 miles of pipeline with a design capacity of approximately 21.1 Bcf of natural gas per day, transported approximately 15 of the total natural gas consumed in the U.S. during 2022 and owns assets in 27 states. The BHE Pipeline Group also operates 22 natural gas storage facilities with a total working gas capacity of 515.6 Bcf and an LNG export, import and storage facility. 
 
 The Pipeline Companies compete with other pipelines on the basis of cost, flexibility, reliability of service and overall customer service, with the customer's decision being made primarily on the basis of delivered price, which includes both the natural gas commodity cost and transportation costs. The Pipeline Companies also compete with midstream operators and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services to meet customer needs. Natural gas competes with alternative energy sources, including coal, nuclear energy, wind, geothermal, solar and fuel oil and the electricity generated from these alternative energy sources. The Pipeline Companies generate a substantial portion of their revenue from long-term firm contracts for transportation and storage services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, the Pipeline Companies face competitive pressures from other natural gas pipeline facilities. 
 
 Subject to regulatory requirements, the Pipeline Companies attempt to recontract or remarket capacity at the maximum rates allowed under their tariffs, although at times the Pipeline Companies discount these rates to remain competitive. Historically, the Pipeline Companies have been able to provide competitively priced services because of access to a variety of relatively low cost supply basins, cost control measures and the relatively high level of firm entitlement that is sold on a seasonal and annual basis, which lowers the per unit cost of transportation. To date, the Pipeline Companies have avoided significant pipeline system bypasses. 
 
 BHE GT S 
 
 BHE GT S' operations, through its ownership of Eastern Energy Gas, includes three interstate natural gas pipeline systems, one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems and one LNG export, import and storage facility. BHE GT S' operations also include smaller LNG facilities, a field service company, and a gathering and processing company. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' principal subsidiaries are EGTS and Carolina Gas Transmission, LLC ("CGT"). EGTS' operations include natural gas transmission and storage pipelines located in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. EGTS also operates one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems located in New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. CGT's operations include an interstate natural gas pipeline system located in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. Eastern Energy Gas also owns a 50 equity interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. ("Iroquois"). Iroquois owns and operates an interstate natural gas pipeline located in the states of New York and Connecticut. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' LNG operations involve the export, import and storage of LNG at the Cove Point LNG Facility that is owned by Cove Point, located in Maryland, as well as the transmission of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic markets and the liquefaction of natural gas for export as LNG. Cove Point's LNG Facility has an operational peak regasification daily send-out capacity of approximately 1.8 million Dth and an aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 14.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent ("Bcfe"). In addition, Cove Point has a small liquefier that has the potential to produce approximately 15,000 Dth/day. The Liquefaction Facility consists of one LNG train with a nameplate outlet capacity of 5.25 million tonnes per annum ("Mtpa"). Cove Point has authorization from the DOE to export up to 0.77 Bcfe/day (approximately 5.75 Mtpa) should the Liquefaction Facility perform better than expected. Cove Point's 36-inch diameter underground interstate natural gas pipelines are approximately 139 miles, with interconnections to Transcontinental Gas Pipeline, LLC in Fairfax County, Virginia, and with Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC and EGTS in Loudoun County, Virginia. Eastern Energy Gas operates, as the general partner, and owns a 25 limited partnership interest in the Cove Point LNG export, import and storage facility. BHE GT S also operates and has ownership interests in three smaller LNG facilities in Alabama, Florida and Pennsylvania. 
 
 In total, Eastern Energy Gas operates approximately 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, of which approximately 5,200 miles are owned by Eastern Energy Gas, with a design capacity of 12.6 Bcf per day as well as approximately 100 miles of natural gas liquids pipelines operated by BHE GT S. EGTS operates approximately 3,900 miles of natural gas transmission and storage pipelines with a design capacity of 9.9 Bcf per day. EGTS also operates 17 underground storage fields with a total working gas capacity of approximately 420 Bcf, of which approximately 307 Bcf relates to natural gas storage field capacity that EGTS owns. BHE GT S' pipeline system is configured with approximately 365 active receipt and delivery points. In 2022, BHE GT S delivered over 2.0 trillion cubic feet ("Tcf") of natural gas to its customers. 
 30 

BHE GT S' natural gas transmission and storage earnings primarily result from rates established by FERC. Revenues derived from BHE GT S' pipeline operations are primarily from reservation charges for firm transmission and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. Reservation charges are required to be paid regardless of volumes transported or stored. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 86 of BHE GT S' transmission capacity is subscribed, including 81 under long-term contracts and 5 on a year-to-year basis, and approximately 97 of EGTS' storage capacity is subscribed with long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining contract term for Eastern Energy Gas' and EGTS' firm transmission contracts is seven years and six years, respectively, and EGTS' storage contracts is four years. Additionally, BHE GT S receives revenue from firm fee-based contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain pipeline transmission and LNG storage and terminal services. Variability in BHE GT S' earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. 
 
 BHE GT S' operating revenue for the year ended December 31 was as follows (in millions): 
 2022 2021 Transmission 849 35 772 36 LNG 790 33 704 32 Storage 316 13 251 12 Gas, liquids and other sales 447 19 433 20 Total operating revenue 2,402 100 2,160 100 
 
 Except for quantities of natural gas owned and managed for operational and system balancing purposes, BHE GT S does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. 
 
 During 2022, BHE GT S had two customers that each accounted for greater than 10 of its operating revenue and its 10 largest customers accounted for 45 of its total operating revenue. BHE GT S has agreements with terms through 2038 to retain the majority of its two largest customers' volumes. The loss of any of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on BHE GT S.

 31 

Northern Natural Gas 
 
 Northern Natural Gas owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the U.S., as measured by pipeline miles, which reaches from west Texas to Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural Gas primarily transports and stores natural gas for utilities, municipalities, gas marketing companies and industrial and commercial users. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of two commercial segments. Its traditional end-use and distribution market area in the northern part of its system, referred to as the Market Area, includes points in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan and Illinois. Its natural gas supply and delivery service area in the southern part of its system, referred to as the Field Area, includes points in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Market Area and Field Area are separated at a Demarcation Point ("Demarc"). Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of 14,400 miles of natural gas pipelines, including 5,900 miles of mainline transmission pipelines and 8,500 miles of branch and lateral pipelines, with a Market Area design capacity of 6.3 Bcf per day, a Field Area delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day to the Market Area and 1.4 Bcf per day to the West Texas area and 95.6 Bcf of working gas capacity in five storage facilities. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system is configured with approximately 2,215 active receipt and delivery points which are integrated with the facilities of LDCs. Many of Northern Natural Gas' LDC customers are part of combined utilities that also use natural gas as a fuel source for electric generation. Northern Natural Gas delivered over 1.4 Tcf of natural gas to its customers in 2022. 
 
 Northern Natural Gas' transportation rates and most of its storage rates are cost-based. These rates are designed to provide Northern Natural Gas with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments. Substantially all of Northern Natural Gas' Market Area transportation revenue is generated from reservation charges, with the balance from usage charges. Most of Northern Natural Gas' transportation capacity in the Market Area is committed to customers under firm transportation contracts, where customers pay Northern Natural Gas a monthly reservation charge for the right to transport natural gas through Northern Natural Gas' system. Reservation charges are required to be paid regardless of volumes transported or stored. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74 of Northern Natural Gas' customers' entitlement in the Market Area have terms beyond 2024 and approximately 61 beyond 2026. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining contract term for Northern Natural Gas' Market Area firm transportation contracts is six years. Northern Natural Gas' Field Area customers consist primarily of energy marketing companies, midstream companies and power generators that are connected to Northern Natural Gas' system in Texas and New Mexico that are contracted on a long-term basis with a weighted average remaining contract term of five years. Northern Natural Gas' storage services are provided through the operation of one underground natural gas storage field in Iowa and two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas. Additionally, Northern Natural Gas has two LNG storage peaking units, one in Iowa and one in Minnesota, that support its transportation service. The three underground natural gas storage facilities and two LNG storage peaking units have a total working gas capacity of over 95.6 Bcf and over 2.2 Bcf per day of peak delivery capability. The average remaining contract term for firm storage contracts is five years. 
 
 Northern Natural Gas' operating revenue for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions): 
 2022 2021 2020 Transportation: Market Area 688 66 658 61 633 65 Field Area 210 22 177 17 226 24 Total transportation 898 88 835 78 859 89 Storage 97 9 94 9 91 9 Total transportation and storage revenue 995 97 929 87 950 98 Gas, liquids and other sales 28 3 143 13 18 2 Total operating revenue 1,023 100 1,072 100 968 100 
 
 Except for quantities of natural gas owned and managed for operational and system balancing purposes, Northern Natural Gas does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. The sale of natural gas for operational and system balancing purposes accounts for the majority of the remaining operating revenue. 
 
 During 2022, Northern Natural Gas had two customers that each accounted for greater than 10 of its transportation and storage revenue and its 10 largest customers accounted for 63 of its system-wide transportation and storage revenue. Northern Natural Gas has agreements with terms through 2027 and 2034 to retain the majority of its two largest customers' volumes. The loss of either of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Northern Natural Gas. 
 
 32 

Kern River 
 
 Kern River owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River operates 1,400 miles of mainline natural gas pipelines, with a year-round design capacity of 2,166,575 Dths, or 2.2 Bcf, per day. Additional seasonal design capacity (Bell-Curve) is contracted in all months except July, August and September. The mainline pipeline extends from the system's point of origination near Opal, Wyoming, through the Central Rocky Mountains to Daggett, California. The mainline section consists of 1,300 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline and 100 miles of various laterals that connect to the mainline. Kern River primarily transports and stores natural gas for utilities, municipalities, gas marketing companies, industrial and commercial users. 
 
 Kern River's rates are designed to provide Kern River with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments and are based on a levelized rate design with recovery of 70 of the original investment during the initial long-term contracts ("Period One rates"). After expiration of the initial term, eligible customers have the option to elect service at rates ("Period Two rates") that are lower than Period One rates because they are designed to recover the remaining 30 of the original investment. To the extent that eligible customers do not contract for service at Period Two rates, the volumes are turned back to Kern River, and it resells capacity at market rates for varying terms. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87 of Kern River's design capacity, including seasonal bell curve, totaled 2,345,381 Dths per day and is contracted pursuant to long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements, whereby Kern River receives natural gas on behalf of customers at designated receipt points and transports the natural gas on a firm basis to designated delivery points. In return for this service, each customer pays Kern River a fixed monthly reservation fee based on each customer's maximum daily quantity, which represents nearly 81 of total operating revenue, and a commodity charge based on the actual amount of natural gas transported pursuant to its long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements and Kern River's tariff. These long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements expire between February 2023 and October 2036 and have a weighted-average remaining contract term of over eight years. As of December 31, 2022, 74 of the year-round design capacity of 2,166,575 Dths under firm contract has primary delivery points in California, with the flexibility to access secondary delivery points in Nevada and Utah. 
 
 Except for quantities of natural gas owned for operational purposes, Kern River does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. Kern River's transportation rates are cost-based. 
 
 During 2022, Kern River had two customers, including Nevada Power Company, an affiliated company, that each accounted for greater than 10 of its revenue. The loss of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Kern River. 

BHE TRANSMISSION 
 
 BHE Transmission consists of BHE Canada, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, BHE U.S. Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, ownership interests in generating facilities and 300 MWs of long-term northbound transmission rights on the Montana Alberta Tie Line (commencing April 30, 2026). BHE Canada and BHE U.S. Transmission together own and operate the Montana Alberta Tie Line, which is a 214-mile, 230-kV transmission line that runs from Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada to Great Falls, Montana, U.S. and connects power grids in the two jurisdictions. 
 
 BHE Canada 
 
 BHE Canada primarily owns AltaLink, a regulated electric transmission utility company headquartered in Alberta, Canada serving approximately 85 of Alberta's population. AltaLink's high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory, which covers a diverse geographic area including most major urban centers in central and southern Alberta. AltaLink's transmission facilities, consisting of approximately 8,300 miles of transmission lines and approximately 310 substations as of December 31, 2022, are an integral part of the Alberta Interconnected Electric System ("AIES"). 
 
 The AIES is a network or grid of transmission facilities operating at high voltages ranging from 69 kV to 500 kV. The grid delivers electricity from generating units across Alberta, Canada through approximately 16,000 miles of transmission lines. The AIES is interconnected to British Columbia's transmission system that links Alberta with the North American western interconnected system, interconnection with Saskatchewan's transmission system and interconnection with Montana's transmission system. 
 
 33 

AltaLink is a transmission facility owner within the electricity industry in Alberta and is permitted to charge a tariff rate for the use of its transmission facilities. Such tariff rates are established on a cost-of-service regulatory model, which is designed to allow AltaLink an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. Transmission tariff rates are approved by the AUC and are collected from the AESO. 
 
 The electricity industry in Alberta consists of four principal segments. Generators sell wholesale power into the power pool operated by the AESO and through direct contractual arrangements. Alberta's transmission system or grid is composed of high voltage power lines and related facilities that transmit electricity from generating facilities to distribution networks and directly connected end-users. Distribution facility owners are regulated by the AUC and are responsible for arranging for, or providing, regulated rate and regulated default supply services to convey electricity from transmission systems and distribution-connected generators to end-use customers. Retailers can procure energy through the power pool, through direct contractual arrangements with energy suppliers or ownership of generation facilities and arrange for its distribution to end-use customers. 
 
 The AESO mandate is defined in the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) and its regulations and requires the AESO to assess both current and future needs of Alberta's interconnected electrical system. In January 2022, the AESO released the 2022 Long-term Transmission Plan. Updated every two years, the Long-Term Transmission Plan seeks to optimize the use of the existing transmission system and plan the development of new transmission to ensure a safe and reliable electricity system that enables a fair, efficient and openly competitive electricity market. The 2022 Long-Term Transmission Plan identifies C 1.3 billion in transmission projects over a 10 year period, which results in C 150 million to C 200 million per year on average over that 10 year period. This results in a cumulative transmission rate impact of C 2 per MWh for the first five to eight years, increasing to C 3 per MWh after 15 years. The Long-Term Transmission Plan identifies approximately C 900 million of projects in AltaLink's service territory with in-service dates before 2030. 
 
 BHE U.S. Transmission 
 
 BHE U.S. Transmission is engaged in various joint ventures to develop, own and operate transmission assets and is pursuing additional investment opportunities in the U.S. Currently, BHE U.S. Transmission has two joint ventures with transmission assets that are operational, ETT, a 50 owned joint venture with subsidiaries of American Electric Power Company, Inc. ("AEP"), and Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC, a 25 owned joint venture with AEP and Evergy, Inc. ETT owns and operates electric transmission assets in the ERCOT and, as of December 31, 2022, had total assets of 3.5 billion. ETT's transmission system includes approximately 1,900 miles of transmission lines and 42 substations as of December 31, 2022. Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC, owns and operates a 108-mile, 345-kV transmission project in Kansas having total assets of 133 million as of December 31, 2022.

HOMESERVICES 
 
 HomeServices, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is one of the largest residential real estate brokerage firms in the U.S. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking; title and closing services; property and casualty insurance; home warranties; relocation services; and other home-related services. HomeServices' real estate brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations because more home sale transactions tend to close during the second and third quarters of the year. As a result, HomeServices' operating results and profitability are typically higher in the second and third quarters relative to the remainder of the year. HomeServices' owned brokerages currently operate in nearly 930 offices in 33 states and the District of Columbia with approximately 45,000 real estate agents under 55 brand names. The U.S. residential real estate brokerage business is subject to the general real estate market conditions, is highly competitive and consists of numerous local brokers and agents in each market seeking to represent sellers and buyers in residential real estate transactions. 
 
 HomeServices' franchise network currently includes approximately 300 franchisees and over 1,500 brokerage offices with nearly 51,000 real estate agents under two brand names, primarily in the U.S. In exchange for certain fees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices or Real Living brand names and other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, advertising programs and other services. 

GENERAL REGULATION 
 
 BHE's regulated subsidiaries and certain affiliates are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation, which significantly influences their operating environment, prices charged to customers, capital structure, costs and, ultimately, their ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding general regulation, refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding certain regulatory matters. 
 
 Domestic Regulated Public Utility Subsidiaries 
 
 The Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various state, federal and local agencies. The more significant aspects of this regulatory framework are described below. 
 
 36 

State Regulation 
 
 Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility's reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. In addition to return on investment, a utility's cost of service generally reflects a representative level of prudent expenses, including cost of sales, operating expense, depreciation and amortization and income and other tax expense, reduced by wholesale electricity and other revenue. The allowed operating expenses are typically based on actual historical costs adjusted for known and measurable or forecasted changes. State regulatory commissions may adjust cost of service for various reasons, including pursuant to a review of: (a) the utility's revenue and expenses during a defined test period, (b) the utility's level of investment and (c) changes in income tax laws. State regulatory commissions typically have the authority to review and change rates on their own initiative; however, they may also initiate reviews at the request of a utility, utility customers or organizations representing groups of customers. In certain jurisdictions, the utility and such parties, however, may agree with one another not to request a review of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. 
 
 The retail electric rates of the Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services. The Utilities have established ECAMs and other cost recovery mechanisms in certain states, which help mitigate their exposure to changes in costs from those assumed in establishing base rates. 
 
 With certain limited exceptions, the Utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Under Oregon law, PacifiCorp has the exclusive right and obligation to provide electricity distribution services to all residential and nonresidential customers within its allocated service territory; however, nonresidential customers have the right to choose an alternative provider of energy supply. The impact of this right on PacifiCorp's consolidated financial results has not been material. In Washington, state law does not provide for exclusive service territory allocation. PacifiCorp's service territory in Washington is surrounded by other public utilities with whom PacifiCorp has from time to time entered into service area agreements under the jurisdiction of the WUTC. Under California law, PacifiCorp has the exclusive right and obligation to provide electricity distribution services to all residential and nonresidential customers within its allocated service territory; however, cities, counties and certain other public agencies have the right to choose to generate energy supply or elect an alternative provider of energy supply through the formation of a Community Choice Aggregator ("CCA"). To date, no CCA activity has occurred in PacifiCorp's California service territory. If a CCA is formed, PacifiCorp would continue to provide CCA customers transmission, distribution, metering and billing services and the CCA would provide generation supply. In addition, PacifiCorp would likely be able to collect costs from CCA customers for the generation-related costs that PacifiCorp incurred while they were customers of PacifiCorp. PacifiCorp would remain the electricity provider of last resort for these customers. In Illinois, state law has established a competitive environment so that all Illinois customers are free to choose their retail service supplier. For customers that choose an alternative retail energy supplier, MidAmerican Energy continues to have an ongoing obligation to deliver the supplier's energy to the retail customer. MidAmerican Energy bills the retail customer for such delivery services. MidAmerican Energy also has an obligation to serve customers at regulated cost-based rates and has a continuing obligation to serve customers who have not selected a competitive electricity provider. The impact of this right on MidAmerican Energy's financial results has not been material. In Nevada, Chapter 704B of the Nevada Revised Statutes allows retail electric customers with an average annual load of one MW or more to file a letter of intent and application with the PUCN to acquire electric energy and ancillary services from another energy supplier. The law requires customers wishing to choose a new supplier to receive the approval of the PUCN to meet public interest standards. In particular, departing customers must secure new energy resources that are not under contract to the Nevada Utilities, the departure must not burden the Nevada Utilities with increased costs or cause any remaining customers to pay increased costs and the departing customers must pay their portion of any deferred energy balances, all as determined by the PUCN. SB 547 revised Chapter 704B to establish limits on the amount of load eligible to take service under Chapter 704B and to set those limits as a part of the IRP filed by the Nevada Utilities. Also, the Utilities and the state regulatory commissions are individually evaluating how best to integrate private generation resources into their service and rate design, including considering such factors as maintaining high levels of customer safety and service reliability, minimizing adverse cost impacts and fairly allocating costs among all customers. 
 
 In Nevada, large natural gas customers using 12,000 therms per month with fuel switching capability are allowed to participate in the incentive natural gas rate tariff. Once a service agreement has been executed, a customer can compare natural gas prices under this tariff to alternative energy sources and choose its source of natural gas. In addition, natural gas customers using greater than 1,000 therms per day have the ability to secure their own natural gas supplies under the gas transportation tariff.

PacifiCorp 
 
 Rate Filings 
 
 Under Utah law, the UPSC must issue a written order within 240 days of a public utility's application for a general rate change. Absent an order, the proposed rates go into effect as filed and are not subject to refund, the UPSC may allow interim rates to take effect within 45 days of an application, subject to refund or surcharge, if an adequate prima facie showing is established in hearing that the interim rate change is justified. 
 
 In Oregon, the OPUC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates for a period not to exceed more than six months, with an additional three-month extension, beyond the 30-day time period when the new rates would otherwise go into effect. Absent suspension or other action from the OPUC, new rates automatically go into effect 30 days from filing by the utility. Upon suspension by the OPUC, the OPUC is authorized to allow the collection of an interim rate, subject to refund, during the pendency of the OPUC's review of the rate request. 
 
 In Wyoming, the WPSC can allow interim rates to go into effect 30 days after the initial application but may require a bond to secure a refund for the amount. The WPSC may suspend the rates for final approval for a period not to exceed 10 months. 
 
 In Washington, the WUTC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed 10 months beyond the 30-day time period when the new rate would otherwise go into effect. 
 Under Idaho law, the IPUC can suspend a filing for an initial period not to exceed five months and an additional extension of 60 days with a showing of good cause. 
 
 In California, the CPUC has the authority to suspend proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed 18 months. The CPUC may extend the suspension period on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Adjustment Mechanisms 
 
 In addition to recovery through base rates, PacifiCorp also achieves recovery of certain costs through various adjustment mechanisms as summarized below. 
 State Regulator Base Rate Test Period Adjustment Mechanism UPSC Forecasted or historical with known and measurable changes (1) 
 EBA under which 100 of the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs is deferred and reflected in future rates. Wheeling revenue is also included in the mechanism. Beginning in 2021, the mechanism includes a true-up of PTCs at 100 . Balancing account to provide for 100 recovery or refund of the difference between the level of REC revenues included in base rates and actual REC revenues after adjusting for a REC incentive authorized by the UPSC. Recovery mechanism for single capital investments that in total exceed 1 of existing rate base when a general rate case has occurred within the preceding 18 months. Effective January 1, 2021, Wildland Fire Mitigation Balancing Account to recover operating expenses and capital expenditures incurred to implement PacifiCorp's Utah Wildland Fire Protection Plan incremental to those included in base rates. 
 OPUC Forecasted PCAM under which 90 of the difference between forecasted net variable power costs and PTCs established under the annual TAM and actual net variable power costs and PTCs is deferred and reflected in future rates. The difference between the forecasted and actual net variable power costs and PTCs must fall outside of an established asymmetrical deadband, with a negative annual power cost variance deadband of 15 million; and a positive annual power cost variance deadband of 30 million and is subject to an earnings test of +/- 1 on PacifiCorp's allowed return on equity. Annual TAM based on forecasted net variable power costs and PTCs. RAC to recover the revenue requirement of new renewable resources and associated transmission costs that are not reflected in general rates. Balancing account for recovery of costs associated with the purchase of RECs necessary to meet Oregon's RPS requirements. Effective January 1, 2021, Annual Wildfire Mitigation and Vegetation Management Cost Recovery Mechanism approved through 2024 to recover vegetation management and wildfire mitigation operations and maintenance costs and wildfire mitigation capital costs, incremental to those included in base rates. Recovery is subject to performance metrics and earnings tests. After 2024, the mechanism will be assessed to determine whether continued use is warranted. 
 38 

WPSC Forecasted or historical with known and measurable changes (1) 
 ECAM under which 80 of the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs is deferred and reflected in future rates. Within the mechanism, chemical costs and start-up fuel costs are also included at the 80 symmetrical sharing band and PTCs are included at 100 symmetrical sharing. REC and SO 2 revenue adjustment mechanism to provide for recovery or refund of 100 of any difference between actual REC and SO 2 revenues and the level in rates. 
 WUTC Historical with known and measurable changes PCAM under which the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs is deferred and reflected in future rates after applying a 4 million deadband for positive or negative net power cost variances. For net power cost variances between 4 million and 10 million, amounts to be recovered from customers are allocated 50/50 and amounts to be credited to customers are allocated 75/25 (customers/PacifiCorp). Positive or negative net power cost variances in excess of 10 million are allocated 90/10 (customers/PacifiCorp). Beginning in 2021, the mechanism includes a true-up of PTCs at 100 . Deferral mechanism of costs for up to 24 months of new base load generation resources and eligible renewable resources and related transmission that qualify under the state's emissions performance standard and are not reflected in base rates. REC revenue tracking mechanism to provide credit of 100 of REC revenues to customers. Decoupling mechanism under which the difference between actual annual revenues and authorized revenues per customer per specified rate schedules is deferred and reflected in future rates, subject to an earnings test. Under the earnings test, 50 of any proportional excess earnings over PacifiCorp's authorized return on equity is returned to customers in addition to any surcharge or surcredit related to the revenue variance. The earnings test is asymmetrical, and adjustments are not made when PacifiCorp earns at or below authorized returns on equity. To trigger a rate adjustment, the deferral balance must exceed plus or minus 2.5 of the authorized revenue at the end of each deferral period by rate class. Rate adjustments must not exceed a surcharge of 5 of the actual normalized revenue by class. IPUC Historical with known and measurable changes ECAM under which 90 of the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs is deferred and reflected in future rates. Also provides for recovery or refund of 100 of the difference between the level of REC revenues included in base rates and actual REC revenues and differences in actual PTCs compared to the amount in base rates. CPUC Forecasted PTAM for major capital additions that allows for rate adjustments outside of the context of a traditional general rate case for the revenue requirement associated with capital additions exceeding 50 million on a total-company basis. Filed as eligible capital additions are placed into service. ECAC that allows for an annual update to actual and forecasted net power costs. PTAM for attrition, a mechanism that allows for an annual adjustment to costs other than net power costs. Catastrophic Events Memorandum Account for catastrophic events, allows for deferral and cost recovery of reasonable costs incurred as the result of catastrophic events, which are events for which a state or federal agency has declared a state of emergency. Fire Risk Mitigation Memorandum Account to track costs related to wildfire mitigation activities incremental to what is in base rates and Wildfire Mitigation Plan Memorandum Account to track costs associated with the implementation of PacifiCorp's approved wildfire mitigation plan. 

(1) PacifiCorp has relied on both historical test periods with known and measurable adjustments, as well as forecasted test periods. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy 
 
 Rate Filings 
 
 Under Iowa law, a utility may implement temporary rates, without IUB review and subject to refund, on or after 10 days of filing a request for higher base rates. If the IUB has not issued a final order within 10 months after the filing date, the temporary rates become final. Under Illinois law, new base rates may become effective 45 days after the filing of a request with the ICC, or earlier with ICC approval. The ICC has authority to suspend the proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed approximately 11 months after filing. South Dakota law authorizes the SDPUC to suspend new base rates for up to six months during the pendency of rate proceedings; however, a utility may implement all or a portion of the proposed new rates six months after the filing of a request for a rate increase subject to refund pending a final order in the proceeding. 
 
 39 

Iowa law also permits rate-regulated utilities to seek ratemaking principles with the IUB prior to the construction of certain types of new generating facilities. Pursuant to this law, MidAmerican Energy has applied for and obtained IUB ratemaking principles orders for a 484-MW (MidAmerican Energy's share) coal-fueled generating facility, a 495-MW combined cycle natural gas-fueled generating facility and 6,639 MWs (nominal ratings) of wind-powered generating facilities as of December 31, 2022. These ratemaking principles established cost caps for the projects, below which such costs are deemed prudent by the IUB and authorized a fixed rate of return on equity for the respective generating facilities over the regulatory life of the facilities in any future Iowa rate proceeding. As of December 31, 2022, the generating facilities in-service totaled 7.6 billion, or 36 , of MidAmerican Energy's regulated property, plant and equipment, net and were subject to these ratemaking principles at a weighted average return on equity of 11.4 with a weighted average remaining life of 32 years. 
 
 Ratemaking principles for several wind-powered generation projects have established mechanisms in Iowa where electric rate base may be reduced. The current revenue sharing mechanism is in accordance with Wind XII ratemaking principles and reduces rate base for Iowa electric returns on equity exceeding an established benchmark. Sharing is triggered by MidAmerican Energy's actual equity return being above a threshold calculated annually. The threshold, not to exceed 11 , is the weighted average equity return of rate base with returns authorized via ratemaking principles proceedings and all other rate base. For all other rate base, the return is based on interest rates on 30-year A-rated utility bond yields plus 400 basis points, with a minimum return of 9.5 . MidAmerican Energy shares with customers 90 of the revenue in excess of the trigger. A second mechanism, the retail customer benefit mechanism, reduces electric rate base for the value of higher cost retail energy displaced by covered wind-powered production and applies to the wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in 2016 under the Wind X project and facilities constructed under the Wind XII project approved by the IUB in 2018. Rate base reductions under these mechanisms are applied to coal and other generation facilities in specified orders. 
 
 Adjustment Mechanisms 
 
 Under its current Iowa, Illinois and South Dakota electric tariffs, MidAmerican Energy is allowed to recover fluctuations in electric energy costs for its retail electric sales through fuel, or energy, cost adjustment mechanisms. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has transmission adjustment clauses to recover certain transmission charges related to retail customers in all jurisdictions. The transmission adjustment mechanisms recover costs billed by the MISO for regional transmission service. The Illinois adjustment mechanism additionally recovers MidAmerican Energy's entire transmission revenue requirement attributable to Illinois. The adjustment mechanisms reduce the regulatory lag for the recovery of energy and transmission costs related to retail electric customers in these jurisdictions and accomplish, with limited timing differences, a pass-through of the related costs to these customers. Recoveries through these adjustment mechanisms are reflected in operating revenue, and the related costs are reflected in cost of fuel and energy or operations and maintenance expense, as applicable. 
 
 Of the wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as of December 31, 2022, 5,022 MWs (nominal ratings) have not been included in the determination of MidAmerican Energy's Iowa retail electric base rates. In accordance with related ratemaking principles, until such time as these generation assets are reflected in base rates and ceasing thereafter, MidAmerican Energy will continue to reduce its revenue from Iowa EAC recoveries by 12 million each calendar year. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's cost of natural gas purchased for resale is collected for each jurisdiction through a uniform PGA, which is updated monthly to reflect changes in actual costs. Subject to prudence reviews, the PGA accomplishes a pass-through of MidAmerican Energy's cost of natural gas purchased for resale to its customers and, accordingly, has no direct effect on net income. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's electric and natural gas energy efficiency program costs are collected through bill riders that are adjusted annually based on actual and expected costs in accordance with the energy efficiency plans filed with and approved by the respective state regulatory commission. As such, the energy efficiency program costs, which are reflected in operations and maintenance expense, and related recoveries, which are reflected in operating revenue, have no direct impact on net income.

MidAmerican Energy has income tax rider mechanisms in Iowa and Illinois that were established in response to 2017 Tax Reform, which enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including, among other things, a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 . South Dakota implemented changes to base rates in response to 2017 Tax Reform. As a result of 2017 Tax Reform, MidAmerican Energy re-measured its accumulated deferred income tax balances at the 21 rate and increased regulatory liabilities pursuant to the approved mechanisms. In December 2018, the IUB approved in final form a tax expense revision mechanism that reduces customer electric rates for the impact of the lower income tax rate on current operations, as calculated annually, and defers the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes created by their re-measurement at the 21 income tax rate to a regulatory liability, the disposition of which will be determined in MidAmerican Energy's next rate case. In 2018, Iowa Senate File 2417 was signed into law, which, among other items, reduced the state of Iowa corporate tax rate from 12 to 9.8 effective in 2021, at which time, the impacts of Iowa Senate File 2417 began to be included in the Iowa tax expense revision mechanism. 
 
 NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific) 
 
 Rate Filings 
 
 Nevada statutes require the Nevada Utilities to file electric general rate cases once every three years with the PUCN. Sierra Pacific may also file natural gas general rate cases with the PUCN. The Nevada Utilities are also subject to a two-part fuel and purchased power adjustment mechanism. The Nevada Utilities make quarterly filings to reset the BTERs, based on the last 12 months of fuel and purchased power costs. The difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the revenue collected in the BTERs is deferred into a balancing account. The DEAA rate clears amounts deferred into the balancing account. Nevada regulations allow an electric or natural gas utility that adjusts its BTERs on a quarterly basis to request PUCN approval to make quarterly changes to its DEAA rate if the request is in the public interest. During required annual DEAA proceedings, the prudence of fuel and purchased power costs is reviewed, and if any costs are disallowed on such grounds, the disallowances will be incorporated into the next quarterly BTERs change. Also, on an annual basis, the Nevada Utilities (a) seek a determination that energy efficiency program expenditures were reasonable, (b) request that the PUCN reset base and amortization EEPR, and (c) request that the PUCN reset base and amortization EEIR. 
 
 EEPR and EEIR 
 
 EEPR was established to allow the Nevada Utilities to recover the costs of implementing energy efficiency programs and EEIR was established to offset the negative impacts on revenue associated with the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs. These rates change once a year in the utility's annual DEAA application based on energy efficiency program budgets prepared by the Nevada Utilities and approved by the PUCN in the IRP proceedings. When the Nevada Utilities' regulatory earned rate of return for a calendar year exceeds the regulatory rate of return used to set base tariff general rates, they are obligated to refund energy efficiency implementation revenue previously collected for that year. 
 
 Net Metering 
 
 Nevada enacted Assembly Bill 405 ("AB 405") on June 15, 2017. The legislation, among other things, established net metering crediting rates for private generation customers with installed net metering systems less than 25 kilowatts. Under AB 405, private generation customers will be compensated for excess energy on a monthly basis at 95 of the rate the customer would have paid for a kilowatt-hour of electricity supplied by the Nevada Utilities for the first 80 MWs of cumulative installed capacity of all net metering systems in Nevada, 88 of the rate for the next 80 MWs, 81 of the rate for the next 80 MWs and 75 of the rate for any additional private generation capacity. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative installed and applied-for capacity of net metering systems under AB 405 in Nevada was 583 MWs. 
 
 Natural Disaster Protection Plan ("NDPP") 
 
 SB 329, Natural Disaster Mitigation Measures, was signed into law on May 22, 2019. The legislation requires the Nevada Utilities to submit a NDPP to the PUCN. The PUCN adopted NDPP regulations on January 29, 2020, that require the Nevada Utilities to file their NDPP for approval on or before March 1 of every third year. The regulations also require annual updates to be filed on or before September 1 of the second and third years of the plan. The plan must include procedures, protocols and other certain information as it relates to the efforts of the Nevada Utilities to prevent or respond to a fire or other natural disaster. The expenditures incurred by the Nevada Utilities in developing and implementing the NDPP are required to be held in a regulatory asset account, with the Nevada Utilities filing an application for recovery on or before March 1 of each year. The PUCN reopened its investigation and rulemaking on SB 329 and the comment period for the reopened investigation ended in early February 2021. Final regulations are pending.

Federal Regulation 
 
 The FERC is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ("Energy Policy Act") and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to 1.5 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. The Utilities have implemented programs and procedures that facilitate and monitor compliance with the FERC's regulations described below. MidAmerican Energy is also subject to regulation by the NRC pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended ("Atomic Energy Act"), with respect to its ownership interest in the Quad Cities Station. 
 
 Wholesale Electricity and Capacity 
 
 The FERC regulates the Utilities' rates charged to wholesale customers for electricity and transmission capacity and related services. Much of the Utilities' wholesale electricity sales and purchases occur under market-based pricing allowed by the FERC and are therefore subject to market volatility. The Utilities are precluded from selling at market-based rates in the PacifiCorp-East, PacifiCorp-West, Nevada Utilities, Idaho Power Company and NorthWestern Energy balancing authority areas. Wholesale electricity sales in those specific balancing authority areas are permitted at cost-based rates. PacifiCorp and the Nevada Utilities have been granted the authority to bid into the California EIM at market-based rates. 
 
 The Utilities' authority to sell electricity in wholesale electricity markets at market-based rates is subject to triennial reviews conducted by the FERC. Accordingly, the Utilities are required to submit triennial filings to the FERC that demonstrate a lack of market power over sales of wholesale electricity and electric generation capacity in their respective market areas. PacifiCorp, the Nevada Utilities and certain affiliates, representing the BHE Northwest Companies, file together for market power study purposes. The BHE Northwest Companies' most recent triennial filing was made in June 2022 and is under review by the FERC. MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Northeast Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Northeast Region was made in June 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in December 2020. MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Central Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Central Region was made in December 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in March 2022. Under the FERC's market-based rules, the Utilities must also file with the FERC a notice of change in status when there is a change in the conditions that the FERC relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. MidAmerican Energy most recently filed a notice of non-material change in status in July 2022, and the filing is currently under review by the FERC. 
 
 Transmission 
 
 PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' wholesale transmission services are regulated by the FERC under cost-based regulation subject to PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' OATTs. These services are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, which means that all potential customers are provided an equal opportunity to access the transmission system. PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC's Standards of Conduct. PacifiCorp and the Nevada Utilities have made several required compliance filings in accordance with these rules. 
 
 In December 2011, PacifiCorp adopted a cost-based formula rate under its OATT for its transmission services. Cost-based formula rates are intended to be an effective means of recovering PacifiCorp's investments and associated costs of its transmission system without the need to file rate cases with the FERC, although the formula rate results are subject to discovery and challenges by the FERC and intervenors. A significant portion of these services are provided to PacifiCorp's energy supply management function. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO as a transmission-owning member. Accordingly, the MISO is the transmission provider under its FERC-approved OATT. While the MISO is responsible for directing the operation of MidAmerican Energy's transmission system, MidAmerican Energy retains ownership of its transmission assets and, therefore, is subject to the FERC's reliability standards discussed below. MidAmerican Energy's transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC's Standards of Conduct. 
 
 42 

MidAmerican Energy constructed and owns four Multi-Value Projects ("MVPs") located in Iowa and Illinois that added approximately 250 miles of 345-kV transmission line to MidAmerican Energy's transmission system since 2012. The MISO's OATT allows for broad cost allocation for MidAmerican Energy's MVPs, including similar MVPs of other MISO participants. Accordingly, a significant portion of the revenue requirement associated with MidAmerican Energy's MVP investments is shared with other MISO participants based on the MISO's cost allocation methodology, and a portion of the revenue requirement of the other participants' MVPs is allocated to MidAmerican Energy, which MidAmerican Energy recovers from customers via a rider mechanism. The transmission assets and financial results of MidAmerican Energy's MVPs are excluded from the determination of its base retail electric rates. 
 
 The FERC has established an extensive number of mandatory reliability standards developed by the NERC and the WECC, including planning and operations, critical infrastructure protection and regional standards. Compliance, enforcement and monitoring oversight of these standards is carried out by the FERC; the NERC; and the WECC for PacifiCorp, Nevada Power, and Sierra Pacific; and the Midwest Reliability Organization for MidAmerican Energy. 
 
 Hydroelectric 
 
 The FERC licenses and regulates the operation of hydroelectric systems, including license compliance and dam safety programs. Most of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC as major systems under the Federal Power Act, and certain of these systems are licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. Under the Federal Power Act, 16 of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric developments are classified as "high hazard potential," meaning it is probable in the event of a dam failure that loss of human life in the downstream population could occur. PacifiCorp uses the FERC's guidelines to develop public safety programs consisting of a dam safety program and emergency action plans. 
 
 For an update regarding PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
 
 General 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to its license and 25 ownership interest in Quad Cities Station. Constellation Energy, the operator and 75 owner of Quad Cities Station, is under contract with MidAmerican Energy to secure and keep in effect all necessary NRC licenses and authorizations. 
 
 The NRC regulates the granting of permits and licenses for the construction and operation of nuclear generating stations and regularly inspects such stations for compliance with applicable laws, regulations and license terms. Current licenses for Quad Cities Station provide for operation until December 14, 2032. The NRC review and regulatory process covers, among other things, operations, maintenance, environmental and radiological aspects of such stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of such licenses. 
 
 Federal regulations provide that any nuclear operating facility may be required to cease operation if the NRC determines there are deficiencies in state, local or utility emergency preparedness plans relating to such facility, and the deficiencies are not corrected. Constellation Energy has advised MidAmerican Energy that an emergency preparedness plan for Quad Cities Station has been approved by the NRC. Constellation Energy has also advised MidAmerican Energy that state and local plans relating to Quad Cities Station have been approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
 
 The NRC also regulates the decommissioning of nuclear-powered generating facilities, including the planning and funding for the eventual decommissioning of the facilities. In accordance with these regulations, MidAmerican Energy submits a biennial report to the NRC providing reasonable assurance that funds will be available to pay its share of the costs of decommissioning Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy has established a trust for the investment of funds collected for nuclear decommissioning of Quad Cities Station. 
 
 43 

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ("NWPA"), the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Constellation Energy, as required by the NWPA, signed a contract with the DOE under which the DOE was to receive spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for disposal beginning not later than January 1998. The DOE did not begin receiving spent nuclear fuel on the scheduled date and remains unable to receive such fuel and waste. The costs to be incurred by the DOE for disposal activities were previously being financed by fees charged to owners and generators of the waste. In accordance with a 2013 ruling by the D.C. Circuit, the DOE, in May 2014, provided notice that, effective May 16, 2014, the spent nuclear fuel disposal fee would be zero. In 2004, Constellation Energy, reached a settlement with the DOE concerning the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. As a result, Quad Cities Station has been billing the DOE, and the DOE is obligated to reimburse the station for all station costs incurred due to the DOE's delay. Constellation Energy has constructed an interim spent fuel storage installation ("ISFSI") at Quad Cities Station consisting of two pads to store spent nuclear fuel in dry casks in order to free space in the storage pool. The first dry cask was placed in-service in 2005. As of December 31, 2021, the first pad at the ISFSI is full, and the second pad is in operation. The first and second pads at the ISFSI are expected to facilitate storage of casks to support operations at Quad Cities Station through the end of its operating licenses. 
 
 Nuclear Insurance 
 
 MidAmerican Energy maintains financial protection against catastrophic loss associated with its interest in Quad Cities Station through a combination of insurance purchased by Constellation Energy, insurance purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy, and the mandatory industry-wide loss funding mechanism afforded under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 ("Price-Anderson"), which was amended and extended by the Energy Policy Act. The general types of coverage maintained are: nuclear liability, property damage or loss and nuclear worker liability, as discussed below. 
 
 Constellation Energy purchases private market nuclear liability insurance for Quad Cities Station in the maximum available amount of 450 million, which includes coverage for MidAmerican Energy's ownership. In accordance with Price-Anderson, excess liability protection above that amount is provided by a mandatory industry-wide Secondary Financial Protection program under which the licensees of nuclear generating facilities could be assessed for liability incurred due to a serious nuclear incident at any commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. Currently, MidAmerican Energy's aggregate maximum potential share of an assessment for Quad Cities Station is approximately 69 million per incident, payable in installments not to exceed 10 million annually. 
 
 The insurance for nuclear property damage losses covers property damage, stabilization and decontamination of the facility, disposal of the decontaminated material and premature decommissioning arising out of a covered loss. For Quad Cities Station, Constellation Energy purchases primary property insurance protection for the combined interests in Quad Cities Station, with coverage limits for nuclear damage losses up to 1.5 billion for nuclear perils and 500 million for non-nuclear perils. MidAmerican Energy also directly purchases extra expense coverage for its share of replacement power and other extra expenses in the event of a covered accidental outage at Quad Cities Station. The property and related coverages purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy and by Constellation Energy, which includes the interests of MidAmerican Energy, are underwritten by an industry mutual insurance company and contain provisions for retrospective premium assessments to be called upon based on the industry mutual board of directors' discretion for adverse loss experience. Currently, the maximum retrospective amounts that could be assessed against MidAmerican Energy from industry mutual policies for its obligations associated with Quad Cities Station total 8 million. 
 
 The master nuclear worker liability coverage, which is purchased by Constellation Energy for Quad Cities Station, is an industry-wide guaranteed-cost policy with an aggregate limit of 450 million for the nuclear industry as a whole, which is in effect to cover tort claims of workers in nuclear-related industries. 
 
 U.S. Mine Safety 
 
 PacifiCorp's surface mining operations are regulated by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which administers federal mine safety and health laws and regulations, and state regulatory agencies. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has the statutory authority to institute a civil action for relief, including a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other appropriate order against a mine operator who fails to pay penalties or fines for violations of federal mine safety standards. Information regarding PacifiCorp's mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Subsidiaries 
 
 The Pipeline Companies are regulated by the FERC, pursuant to the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service, (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities and (c) the construction and operation of LNG export/import facilities. The Pipeline Companies hold certificates of public convenience and necessity and LNG facility authorizations issued by the FERC, which authorize them to construct, operate and maintain their pipeline and related facilities and services. 
 
 In February 2022, the FERC updated its certificate policy that guides the authorization of natural gas projects and issued an interim policy providing guidance on how the FERC will review a natural gas project for its impact on climate change. The policies apply to pending and future natural gas projects. On March 24, 2022, the FERC revoked application of the policies and sought further comments. 
 
 FERC regulations and the Pipeline Companies' tariffs allow each of the Pipeline Companies to charge approved rates for the services set forth in their respective tariffs. Generally, these rates are a function of the cost of providing services to customers, including prudently incurred operations and maintenance expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a reasonable return on invested capital. Tariff rates for each of the Pipeline Companies have been developed under a rate design methodology whereby substantially all fixed costs, including a return on invested capital and income taxes, are collected through reservation charges, which are paid by firm transportation and storage customers regardless of volumes shipped. Commodity charges, which are paid only with respect to volumes actually shipped, are designed to recover the remaining, primarily variable, costs. Kern River's reservation rates have historically been approved using a "levelized" cost-of-service methodology so that the rate remains constant over the levelization period. This levelized cost of service has been achieved by using a FERC-approved depreciation schedule in which depreciation increases as the cost of capital decreases on declining rate base. Each of the Pipeline Companies also hold authority to negotiate rates for their services, subject to requirements to offer cost-based rate alternatives, and to publish such negotiated rates. In addition, for services that are not subject to FERC rate jurisdiction pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, Cove Point charges rates that are established by contract. 
 
 The Pipeline Companies' rates are subject to change in future general rate proceedings. Rates for natural gas pipelines are changed by filings under either Section 5 or Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. Section 5 proceedings are initiated by the FERC or the pipeline's customers for a potential reduction to rates that the FERC finds are no longer just and reasonable. In a Section 5 proceeding, the initiating party has the burden of demonstrating that the currently effective rates of the pipeline are no longer just and reasonable, and of demonstrating alternative just and reasonable rates. Any rate decrease as a result of a Section 5 proceeding is implemented prospectively upon the issuance of a final FERC order adopting the new just and reasonable rates. Section 4 rate proceedings are initiated by the natural gas pipeline, who must demonstrate that the new proposed rates are just and reasonable. The new rates as a result of a Section 4 proceeding are typically implemented six months after the Section 4 filing if higher than prior rates and are subject to refund upon issuance of a final order by the FERC. 
 
 The FERC-regulated natural gas companies may not grant undue preference to any customer. FERC regulations require that certain information be made public for market access, through standardized internet websites. These regulations also restrict each pipeline's marketing affiliates' access to certain non-public information that could affect price or availability of service. 
 
 Interstate natural gas pipelines are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended ("NGPSA"), which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas facilities, and requires an entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such plans. Major amendments to the NGPSA include the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("2002 Act"), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 ("2006 Act"), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 ("2011 Act") the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 ("2016 Act") and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 ("2020 Act"). 
 
 45 

The 2002 Act established additional safety and pipeline integrity regulations for all natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas. The 2002 Act imposed major new requirements in the areas of operator qualifications, risk analysis and integrity management. The 2002 Act mandated more frequent periodic inspection or testing of natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas, which are locations where the potential consequences of a natural gas pipeline accident may be significant or may do considerable harm to persons or property. Pursuant to the 2002 Act, the DOT promulgated regulations that require natural gas pipeline operators to develop comprehensive integrity management programs, to identify applicable threats to natural gas pipeline segments that could impact high-consequence areas, to assess these segments and to provide ongoing mitigation and monitoring. The regulations require recurring inspections of high-consequence area segments every seven years after the initial baseline assessment. 
 
 The 2006 Act required pipeline operators to institute human factors management plans for personnel employed in pipeline control centers. DOT regulations published pursuant to the 2006 Act required development and implementation of written control room management procedures. 
 
 The 2011 Act was a response to natural gas pipeline incidents, most notably the San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion that occurred in September 2010 in California. The 2011 Act increased the maximum allowable civil penalties for violations, directs operator assistance for Federal authorities conducting investigations and authorized the DOT to hire additional inspection and enforcement personnel. The 2011 Act also directed the DOT to study several topics, including the definition of high-consequence areas, the use of automatic shutoff valves in high-consequence areas, expansion of integrity management requirements beyond high-consequence areas and cast iron pipe replacement. The studies are complete, and a number of notices of proposed rulemaking have been issued. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") issued the Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: MAOP Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements and Other Related Amendments final rule in October 2019. The primary change was the expansion of the pipeline integrity assessment requirements to cover moderate-consequence areas and reconfirming maximum allowable operating pressures. Pipeline operators were required to develop procedures to address assessment requirements by July 2021 and complete 50 of the required MAOP reconfirmation actions by 2028 and the remaining by 2035. The BHE Pipeline Group has updated procedures, identified pipeline segments subject to the rule and has planned projects to complete required assessments. PHMSA sent Part 2 of the rule to the Federal Register for publishing August 4, 2022, and it was published in the Federal Register August 24, 2022. The rule initially had an effective date of May 2023, but has been extended to February 2024. The third part of the rule, the gas gathering rule, has also been issued, but has minimal impact on the BHE Pipeline Group. 
 
 The 2016 Act required the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to set federal minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and authorized emergency order authority. In February 2020, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a final rule regarding underground natural gas storage facilities that incorporates by reference the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 1171, "Functional Integrity of Natural Gas Storage in Depleted Hydrocarbon Reservoirs and Aquifer Reservoirs," clarifies certain aspects of the mandatory nature of the standard and defines regulatory completion dates for underground storage facility risk assessments. The BHE Pipeline Group has 20 total underground natural gas storage fields at EGTS and Northern Natural Gas that fall under this regulation and is complying with the final rule. The BHE Pipeline Group underground storage fields have had several audits under the Final Rule with no notices of probable violations issued. Kern River, Carolina Gas and Cove Point do not have underground natural gas storage facilities. 
 
 The 2020 Act required operations to review and update their inspection and maintenance plans to address how the plans contribute to eliminate hazardous leaks of natural gas, reduction of fugitive emissions and replacement or remediation of pipelines that are known to leak based on the material, design or past operating maintenance history. BHE Pipeline Group has completed the review and update of its inspection and maintenance plans. To assist in this effort, Kern River participated in a non-punitive pilot inspection with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. 
 
 The DOT and related state agencies routinely audit and inspect the pipeline facilities for compliance with their regulations. The Pipeline Companies conduct periodic internal audits of their facilities with more frequent reviews of those deemed higher risk. The Pipeline Companies also conduct preliminary audits in advance of agency audits. Compliance issues that arise during these audits or during the normal course of business are addressed on a timely basis. The Pipeline Companies believe their pipeline systems comply in all material respects with the NGPSA and with DOT regulations issued pursuant to the NGPSA.

Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, as holders of electricity distribution licenses, are subject to regulation by GEMA. GEMA regulates distribution network operators ("DNOs") within the terms of the Electricity Act 1989 and the terms of DNO licenses, which are revocable with 25 years notice. Under the Electricity Act 1989, GEMA has a duty to ensure that DNOs can finance their regulated activities and DNOs have a duty to maintain an investment grade credit rating. GEMA discharges certain of its duties through its staff within Ofgem. Each of fourteen licensed DNOs distributes electricity from the national grid transmission system and distribution-connected generators to end users within its respective distribution services area. 
 
 DNOs are subject to price controls, enforced by Ofgem, that limit the revenue that may be recovered and retained from their electricity distribution activities. The regulatory regime that has been applied to electricity distributors in Great Britain encourages companies to look for efficiency gains in order to improve profits. The distribution price control formula also adjusts the revenue received by DNOs to reflect a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation (as measured by the United Kingdom's Retail Prices Index) and the quality of service delivered by the licensee's distribution system. The next price control, Electricity Distribution 2 ("ED2"), will be set for a period of five years, starting April 1, 2023, although the formula has been, and may be, reviewed by the regulator following public consultation. The procedure and methodology adopted at a price control review are at the reasonable discretion of Ofgem. Ofgem's judgment of the future allowed revenue of licensees is likely to take into account, among other things: 
 the actual operating and capital costs of each of the licensees; 
 the operating and capital costs that each of the licensees would incur if it were as efficient as, in Ofgem's judgment, the more efficient licensees; 
 the actual value of certain costs which are judged to be beyond the control of the licensees; 
 the taxes that each licensee is expected to pay; 
 the regulatory value ascribed to the expenditures that have been incurred in the past and the efficient expenditures that are to be incurred in the forthcoming regulatory period; 
 the rate of return to be allowed on expenditures that make up the regulatory asset value; 
 the financial ratios of each of the licensees and the license requirement for each licensee to maintain investment grade status; 
 an allowance in respect of the repair of the pension deficits in the defined benefit pension schemes sponsored by each of the licensees; and 
 any under- or over-recoveries of revenues, relative to allowed revenues, in the previous price control period. 
 
 A number of incentive schemes also operate within the current price control period to encourage DNOs to provide an appropriate quality of service to end users. This includes specified payments to be made for failures to meet prescribed standards of service. The aggregate of these guaranteed standards payments is uncapped but may be excused in certain prescribed circumstances that are generally beyond the control of the DNOs. 
 
 The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and is due to terminate on March 31, 2023, and will be immediately replaced with a new price control. Although it has been the convention in Great Britain for regulators to conduct periodic regulatory reviews before making proposals for any changes to the price controls, a new price control can be implemented by GEMA without the consent of the DNOs. If a licensee disagrees with a change to its license, it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's CMA, as can certain other parties. Any appeals must be notified within 20 working days of the license modification by GEMA. If the CMA determines that the appellant has relevant standing, then the statute requires that the CMA complete its process within six months, or in some exceptional circumstances seven months. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies appealed Ofgem's proposals for the resetting of the formula that commenced April 1, 2015, as did one other party, and the CMA subsequently revised GEMA's decision. 
 
 The current price control was the first to be set for electricity distribution in Great Britain since Ofgem completed its review of network regulation (known as the RPI-X @ 20 project). The key changes to the price control calculations, compared to those used in previous price controls are that: 
 the period over which new regulatory assets are depreciated is being gradually lengthened, from 20 years to 45 years, with the change being phased over eight years; 
 47 

allowed revenues will be adjusted during the price control period, rather than at the next price control review, to partially reflect cost variances relative to cost allowances; 
 the allowed cost of debt will be updated within the price control period by reference to a long-run trailing average based on external benchmarks of utility debt costs; 
 allowed revenues will be adjusted in relation to some new service standard incentives, principally relating to speed and service standards for new connections to the network; and 
 there was scope for a mid-period review and adjustment to revenues in the latter half of the period for any changes in the outputs required of licensees for certain specified reasons, although GEMA made no adjustments under this provision. 
 
 Under the current price control, as revised by the CMA, and excluding the effects of incentive schemes and any deferred revenues from the prior price control, the opening base allowed revenue of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc remains constant in all subsequent years within the price control period (ED1) through 2022-23, before the addition of inflation. Nominal opening base allowed revenues will increase in line with inflation. Adjustments are made annually to recognize the effect of factors such as changes in the allowed cost of debt, performance on incentive schemes and catch up of prior year under- or over- recoveries. 
 
 Ofgem has completed the price control review that will result in a new price control effective April 1, 2023. The license modifications that give effect to the price control were published by Ofgem on February 3, 2023 and may be subject to appeal to the CMA if an appeal is filed by March 3, 2023. Many aspects of the current price control were maintained and the changes made generally follow the template that was set by the price controls implemented in April 2021 for transmission and gas distribution in Great Britain. Specific changes include new service standard incentives and mechanisms to adjust cost allowances in specific circumstances, particularly related to investment required to support decarbonization efforts, and partially updating the allowed return on equity within the period for changes in the interest rate on government bonds. Ofgem's final determinations also included an allowed cost of equity of 5.23 plus inflation (calculated using the United Kingdom's consumer prices index including owner occupiers' housing costs) and cost allowances representing a 20 real-term increase compared to the current regulatory period annual average. The base allowed revenue, excluding the effects of incentive schemes, pass-through costs and any deferred revenues from the prior price control, will decrease approximately 4.0 at Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and will increase approximately 2.5 at Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, respectively, in 2023-24 before the addition of inflation. 
 
 Ofgem also monitors DNO compliance with license conditions and enforces the remedies resulting from any breach of condition. License conditions include the prices and terms of service, financial strength of the DNO, the provision of information to Ofgem and the public, as well as maintaining transparency, non-discrimination and avoidance of cross-subsidy in the provision of such services. Ofgem also monitors and enforces certain duties of a DNO set out in the Electricity Act 1989, including the duty to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity distribution. Under changes to the Electricity Act 1989 introduced by the Utilities Act 2000, GEMA is able to impose financial penalties on DNOs that contravene any of their license duties or certain of their duties under the Electricity Act 1989, as amended, or that are failing to achieve a satisfactory performance in relation to the individual standards prescribed by GEMA. Any penalty imposed must be reasonable and may not exceed 10 of the licensee's revenue. 
 
 AltaLink 
 
 AltaLink is regulated by the AUC, pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency established by the province of Alberta, Canada, which is responsible for, among other things, approving the tariffs of transmission facility owners, including AltaLink, and distribution utilities, acquisitions of such transmission facility owners or utilities, and construction and operation of new transmission projects in Alberta. The AUC also investigates and rules on regulated rate disputes and system access problems. The AUC regulates and oversees Alberta's electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink's activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. 
 
 48 

The AUC has various core functions in regulating the Alberta electricity transmission sector, including the following: 
 regulating and adjudicating issues related to the operation of electric utilities within Alberta; 
 processing and approving general tariff applications relating to revenue requirements, capital expenditure prudency and rates of return including deemed capital structure for regulated utilities while ensuring that utility rates are just and reasonable, and approval of the transmission tariff rates of regulated transmission providers paid by the AESO, which is the independent transmission system operator in Alberta, Canada that controls the operation of AltaLink's transmission system; 
 approving the need for new electricity transmission facilities and permits to build and licenses to operate electricity transmission facilities; 
 reviewing operations and accounts from electric utilities and conducting on-site inspections to ensure compliance with industry regulation and standards; 
 adjudicating enforcement issues including the imposition of administrative penalties that arise when market participants violate the rules of the AESO; and 
 collecting, storing, analyzing, appraising and disseminating information to effectively fulfill its duties as an industry regulator. 
 
 In addition, AUC approval is required in connection with new energy and regulated utility initiatives in Alberta, amendments to existing approvals and financing proposals by designated utilities. 
 
 AltaLink's tariffs are regulated by the AUC under the provisions of the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) in respect of rates and terms and conditions of service. The Electric Utilities Act (Alberta) and related regulations require the AUC to consider that it is in the public interest to provide consumers the benefit of unconstrained transmission access to competitive generation and the wholesale electricity market. In regulating transmission tariffs, the AUC must facilitate sufficient investment to ensure the timely upgrade, enhancement or expansion of transmission facilities, and foster a stable investment climate and a continued stream of capital investment for the transmission system. 
 
 Under the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the AESO for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AUC reviews and approves such tariff applications based on a cost-of-service regulatory model under a forward test year basis. Under this model, the AUC provides AltaLink with a reasonable opportunity to (i) earn a fair return on equity; and (ii) recover its forecast costs, including operating expenses, depreciation, borrowing costs and taxes (including deemed income taxes) associated with its regulated transmission business. The AUC must approve tariffs that are just, reasonable and not unduly preferential, arbitrary or unjustly discriminatory. AltaLink's transmission tariffs are not dependent on the price or volume of electricity transported through its transmission system. 
 
 The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees the Alberta Interconnected Electric System ("AIES") and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. AltaLink and the other transmission facility owners receive substantially all of their transmission tariff revenues from the AESO. The AESO, in turn, charges wholesale tariffs, approved by the AUC, in a manner that promotes fair and open access to the AIES and facilitates a competitive market for the purchase and sale of electricity. The AESO monitors compliance with approved reliability standards, which are enforced by the Market Surveillance Administrator, which may impose penalties on transmission facility owners for non-compliance with the approved reliability standards. 
 
 The AESO determines the need and plans for the expansion and enhancement of the transmission system in Alberta in accordance with applicable law and reliability standards. The AESO's responsibilities include long-term transmission planning and management, including assessing the current and future transmission system capacity needs of market participants. When the AESO determines an expansion or enhancement of the transmission system is needed, with limited exceptions, it submits an application to the AUC for approval of the proposed expansion or enhancement. The AESO then determines which transmission provider should submit an application to the AUC for a permit and license to construct and operate the designated transmission facilities. Generally, the transmission provider operating in the geographic area where the transmission facilities expansion or enhancement is to be located is selected by the AESO to build, own and operate the transmission facilities. In addition, Alberta law provides that certain transmission projects may be subject to a competitive process open to qualified bidders.

Independent Power Projects 
 
 The Yuma, Cordova, Saranac, Power Resources, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Bishop Hill II, Jumbo Road, Marshall, Grande Prairie, Walnut Ridge, Pinyon Pines I, Pinyon Pines II, Santa Rita, Independence, Fluvanna II, Flat Top, Mariah del Norte, Alamo 6 and Pearl independent power projects are Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWG") under the Energy Policy Act, while the Community Solar Gardens, Imperial Valley and Wailuku independent power projects are currently certified as Qualifying Facilities ("QF") under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Both EWGs and QFs generally are exempt from compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electric generating plant and the prices and terms at which electricity may be sold by the facilities. 
 
 The Yuma, Cordova, Saranac, Imperial Valley, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Bishop Hill II, Marshall, Grande Prairie, Walnut Ridge, Independence, Pinyon Pines I and Pinyon Pines II independent power projects have obtained authority from the FERC to sell their power at market-based rates. This authority to sell electricity in wholesale electricity markets at market-based rates is subject to triennial reviews conducted by the FERC. Accordingly, the respective independent power projects are required to submit triennial filings to the FERC that demonstrate a lack of market power over sales of wholesale electricity and electric generation capacity in their respective market areas. The Pinyon Pines I, Pinyon Pines II, Solar Star 1, Solar Star 2, Topaz and Yuma independent power projects and power marketers CalEnergy, LLC and BHER Market Operations, LLC file together for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Southwest Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Southwest Region was made in June 2022 and is awaiting FERC action. The Cordova and Saranac independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together with MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Northeast Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Northeast Region was made in June 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in December 2020. The Bishop Hill II and Walnut Ridge independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together with MidAmerican Energy and certain affiliates for market power study purposes of the FERC-defined Central Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Central Region was made in December 2020 and an order accepting it was issued in March 2021. The Marshall and Grande Prairie independent power projects and power marketer CalEnergy, LLC file together for market power study purposes in the FERC-defined Southwest Power Pool Region. The most recent triennial filing for the Southwest Power Pool Region was made in December 2021, was supplemented in July 2022 and an order accepting it was issued in January 2023. Power marketers CalEnergy LLC and BHER Market Operations, LLC also file for market power study purposes in the FERC-defined Northwest Region together with PacifiCorp, Nevada Power Company, Sierra Power Company and certain affiliates. The most recent triennial filing for the Northwest Region was made in June 2022, and is awaiting FERC action. 
 
 The entire output of Jumbo Road, Santa Rita, Fluvanna II, Flat Top, Mariah del Norte, Alamo 6, Pearl and Power Resources is within the ERCOT and market-based authority is not required for such sales solely within ERCOT as the ERCOT market is not a FERC-jurisdictional market. Similarly, Wailuku sells its output solely to the Hawaii Electric Light Company within the Hawaii electric grid, which is not a FERC-jurisdictional market and therefore, Wailuku does not require market-based rate authority. 
 
 EWGs are permitted to sell capacity and electricity only in the wholesale markets, not to end users. Additionally, utilities are required to purchase electricity produced by QFs at a price that does not exceed the purchasing utility's "avoided cost" and to sell back-up power to the QFs on a non-discriminatory basis, unless they have successfully petitioned the FERC for an exemption from this purchase requirement. Avoided cost is defined generally as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the QF on a long-term basis. The Energy Policy Act eliminated the purchase requirement for utilities with respect to new contracts under certain conditions. New QF contracts are also subject to FERC rate filing requirements, unlike QF contracts entered into prior to the Energy Policy Act. FERC regulations also permit QFs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates other than the utility's avoided cost.

REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding regulatory matters, refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the general regulatory framework. 
 
 PacifiCorp 
 
 Oregon 
 
 In July 2021, in accordance with the OPUC's December 2020 general rate case order, PacifiCorp filed an application with the OPUC to initiate the review of PacifiCorp's estimated decommissioning and other closure costs per third-party studies associated with its coal-fueled generating facilities. The application requested an initial rate increase of 35 million, or 2.8 , to become effective January 1, 2022, to recover the incremental costs from those approved in the last general rate case. In November 2023, an independent evaluator was selected. Until the independent evaluator completes its work reviewing the third party studies that contain the estimated decommissioning and other closure costs and the OPUC issues an order, there will be no change to rates related to this filing. 
 
 In March 2022, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting an overall rate change of 82 million, or 6.6 , to become effective January 1, 2023, that includes cost increases associated with the implementation of PacifiCorp's wildfire mitigation and vegetation management plans. Parties to the case filed testimony in June 2022. PacifiCorp filed reply testimony in July 2022 supporting an overall rate increase of 94 million but proposing that the request be capped at PacifiCorp's original request. PacifiCorp and parties to the case settled various aspects of the general rate case in multiple settlement stipulations. In August 2022, the first partial stipulation was filed resolving issues related to wildfire mitigation and vegetation management, including addressing the associated costs increases. Also in August 2022, a second partial stipulation was filed representing the settlement of certain revenue requirement issues among the stipulating parties, including the extension of Oregon's recovery period for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 that will be converted to natural gas-fueled units and certain other issues. In September 2022, a third stipulation was filed resolving most of the remaining issues in the general rate case following the first and second partial stipulations. The stipulations together result in a total rate increase of 49 million, or 3.9 , effective January 1, 2023. The stipulating parties also agreed to amortize certain deferrals totaling approximately 10 million, or 0.8 , in the first year of amortization, effective April 1, 2023. Further, in the third stipulation, PacifiCorp agreed to a general rate case stay-out provision under which it agreed not to file a general rate case with rates effective any earlier than January 1, 2025. In September 2022, the fourth and final partial stipulation was filed resolving technical issues related to a voluntary renewable energy tariff that will allow non-residential customers to purchase energy from renewable resources not currently in PacifiCorp's rates. In December 2022, the OPUC approved the first, second and third stipulations. The fourth stipulation was approved by the OPUC in February 2023. 
 
 In May 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 PCAM, which is the first time since the mechanism has been in place that a rate change has been warranted. After consideration of the mechanism's deadband, sharing band and earnings test, PacifiCorp requested recovery of 52 million, or a 4.2 increase, to become effective January 1, 2023. This request is incremental to the rate change sought in the general rate case. In September 2022, a settlement stipulation was filed agreeing to the recovery of the requested 52 million over a four-year period beginning April 1, 2023. In December 2022, the OPUC approved the settlement stipulation. 
 
 In July 2022, PacifiCorp filed an application requesting approval of an automatic adjustment clause with a balancing account to recover costs associated with implementing PacifiCorp's wildfire protection plan in Oregon. Oregon Senate Bill 762 provides for utilities to timely recover these costs through an automatic adjustment clause. The filing requests a rate increase of 20 million, or 1.6 , to recover incremental costs in 2022 and is incremental to costs addressed in PacifiCorp's wildfire mitigation and vegetation management mechanism through the general rate case stipulation described above. While PacifiCorp requested an effective date of August 24, 2022, the OPUC has suspended the filing for further review. In December 2022, a stipulation with certain parties was filed agreeing to the establishment of an automatic adjustment clause. A decision on the stipulation is expected in 2023. 
 
 Washington 
 
 In June 2021, PacifiCorp filed a power cost only rate case to update baseline net power costs for 2022. PacifiCorp requested a 13 million, or 3.7 , rate increase with an effective date of January 1, 2022. In November 2021, PacifiCorp reached a proposed settlement with most of the parties, which includes an agreement to adjust the PTC rate in base rates and apply a production factor and include a net power cost update as part of the compliance filing. A hearing was held in January 2022 and the WUTC issued an order approving the settlement in March 2022. A compliance filing reflecting a 43 million, or 12.2 , increase was filed in April 2022 and was approved by the WUTC the same month with rates effective May 1, 2022. 
 51 

In June 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2021 PCAM and the new tracking mechanism for PTCs approved in the 2021 general rate case. For the 2021 PCAM, PacifiCorp is requesting a recovery of 26 million, or a 6.5 increase. PacifiCorp proposed that the 2021 PCAM be amortized over two years, rather than the one-year period required under the current terms of the PCAM. For the new 2021 PTC tracker, PacifiCorp is seeking recovery of 3 million, or an 0.8 increase. In November 2022, the WUTC approved PacifiCorp's proposal resulting in a combined annual increase of 16 million, or 4.0 , effective January 1, 2023. 
 
 Idaho 
 
 In October 2022, PacifiCorp filed an application for authority to implement the residential rate modernization plan. The plan proposes a five-year transition to increase the monthly customer service charge from 8.00 to 29.25 per month with a corresponding reduction to the energy rate, eliminates the tiered rates, and adjusts the on-peak off-peak period for time-of-day customers. 
 
 California 
 
 In August 2021, PacifiCorp filed an application with the CPUC to address California energy costs and GHG allowance costs, and in January 2022, an amended application was filed, per CPUC direction, to reflect ECAC rates which had been approved since the original filing was made. The amended application included an over 3 million rate increase associated with higher energy costs, and the previously sought increase of 3 million to recover GHG allowances. In March 2022, the CPUC approved the increase of 3 million to recover costs for purchasing GHG allowances as required by the state's Cap-and-Trade program. In November 2022, the CPUC approved and made effective the over 3 million rate increase associated with higher energy costs, for a combined rate increase of 7 million, or 6.6 . 
 
 In May 2022, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case requesting an overall rate change of 28 million, or 25.7 , to become effective January 1, 2023. In November 2022, the CPUC granted the requested rate effective date and directed PacifiCorp to establish a memorandum account to track the change in rates beginning January 1, 2023 until the new rates become effective, upon the issuance of a decision in late 2023. PacifiCorp filed rebuttal testimony in February 2023 with a slight adjustment of an overall rate increase of 27 million, or 25.0 . Also in February 2023, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting additional information on PacifiCorp's wildfire and risk analyses, and requested additional information regarding wildfire memorandum accounts. 
 
 In August 2022, PacifiCorp filed its 2023 combined ECAC and GHG application requesting an overall rate increase of 15 million, or 13.6 , effective January 1, 2023. Approximately 4 million of the increase, or 3.6 , is attributed to the ECAC rate and 11 million of the increase, or 10.0 , to the GHG rate. In February 2023, PacifiCorp filed an amended application, per CPUC direction, to reflect ECAC rates which had been approved since the original filing was made in August 2022. The amended application would result in an overall rate increase of 11 million, or 10.1 . PacifiCorp anticipates interim approval of its GHG rates in March 2023 based on settlement discussions with parties. 
 
 FERC Show Cause Order 
 
 On April 15, 2021, the FERC issued an order to show cause and notice of proposed penalty related to allegations made by FERC Office of Enforcement staff that PacifiCorp failed to comply with certain NERC reliability standards associated with facility ratings on PacifiCorp's bulk electric system. The order directs PacifiCorp to show cause as to why it should not be assessed a civil penalty of 42 million as a result of the alleged violations. The allegations are related to PacifiCorp's response to a 2010 industry-wide effort directed by the NERC to identify and remediate certain discrepancies resulting from transmission facility design and actual field conditions, including transmission line clearances. In July 2021, PacifiCorp filed its answer to the FERC's show cause order denying the alleged violation of certain NERC reliability standards. The FERC Office of Enforcement staff replied in September 2021. In December 2022, the FERC issued a final order approving a stipulation and consent agreement between the FERC Office of Enforcement and PacifiCorp whereby PacifiCorp agreed to pay a 1.9 million cash penalty and committed to invest 2.5 million in reliability enhancements. The final order concludes the matter.

MidAmerican Energy 
 
 South Dakota 
 
 In May 2022, MidAmerican Energy filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission ("SDPUC") for an increase in its South Dakota retail natural gas rates, which would increase revenue by 7 million annually. If approved, the requested rates would increase retail customers' bills by an average of 6.4 . 
 
 Wind PRIME 
 
 In January 2022, MidAmerican Energy filed an application with the IUB for advance ratemaking principles for Wind PRIME. If approved, MidAmerican Energy expects to proceed with Wind PRIME, which consists of up to 2,042 MWs of new wind generation and up to 50 MWs of solar generation. If all of Wind PRIME generation is constructed, MidAmerican Energy will own over 9,300 MWs of wind generation and nearly 200 MWs of solar generation. Wind PRIME is projected to allow MidAmerican Energy to generate renewable energy greater than or equal to all of its Iowa retail customers' annual energy needs. MidAmerican Energy secured sufficient safe harbor equipment necessary to remain eligible for 100 PTCs under current tax law. Procedural hearings with the IUB began in February 2023. 
 
 Iowa Transmission Legislation 
 
 In June 2020, Iowa enacted legislation that grants incumbent electric transmission owners the right to construct, own and maintain electric transmission lines that have been approved for construction in a federally registered planning authority's transmission plan and that connect to the incumbent electric transmission owner's facility. Also known as the Right of First Refusal, the law ensures MidAmerican Energy, as an incumbent electric transmission owner, has the legal right to construct, own and maintain transmission lines that have been approved by the MISO (or another federally registered planning authority) in MidAmerican Energy's service territory. To exercise the legal right, MidAmerican Energy must notify the IUB within 90 days of any such approval for construction that it intends to construct, own and maintain the electric transmission line. The law still requires an incumbent electric transmission owner to obtain a state franchise from the IUB to construct, erect, maintain or operate an electric transmission line and, upon issuance of a franchise, the incumbent electric transmission owner must provide the IUB an estimate of the cost to construct the electric transmission line and, until the construction is complete, a quarterly report updating the estimated cost to construct the electric transmission line. Legal challenges have been brought against similar laws in other states, but courts that have ruled on such cases have upheld the states' laws. In October 2020, a lawsuit challenging the law was filed in Iowa by national transmission interests. The suit raised issues specific to Iowa law, and the State of Iowa defended the law in the suit. MidAmerican Energy intervened and defended the law as well. The Iowa district court dismissed the lawsuit in March 2021 for lack of standing, and the national transmission interests appealed. In June 2022, the Iowa Court of Appeals upheld the district court's decision, after which the national transmission interests asked the Iowa Supreme Court to reconsider. In November 2022, the Iowa Supreme Court granted the motion to reconsider and accepted the case on the briefs already submitted; it is expected that oral arguments will be held in spring 2023. No stay of the law has been granted, and the law remains in effect pending appeal.

NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific) 
 
 Senate Bill 448 ("SB 448") 
 
 SB 448 was signed into law on June 10, 2021. The legislation is intended to accelerate transmission development, renewable energy and storage, and accelerate transportation electrification within the state of Nevada. In September 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 Joint IRP for the approval of their Transmission Infrastructure for a Clean Energy Economy Plan that sets forth a plan for the construction of high-voltage transmission infrastructure, Greenlink North among others, that will be placed into service no later than December 31, 2028, and requires the IRP to include at least one scenario that uses sources of supply that will achieve certain reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. In September 2021, the Nevada Utilities filed an application for the approval of their Economic Recovery Transportation Electrification Plan to accelerate transportation electrification in the state of Nevada. The plan establishes requirements for the contents of the transportation electrification investment as well as requirements for review, cost recovery and monitoring. The plan covers an initial period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. In November 2021, the PUCN issued an order granting the application and accepting the Economic Recovery Transportation Electrification Plan with some modifications. The PUCN opened rulemakings to address other regulations that resulted from SB 448. In February 2022, the PUCN adopted regulations regarding the Economic Development Electric Rate Rider Program to revise the discounted electric rates to ease the economic burden on small businesses who take advantage of the discounted rates under the tariff. In September 2022, the PUCN adopted regulations regarding resource planning, which incorporates a plan to accelerate transportation electrification into the distributed resources plan pursuant to SB 448. 
 
 Transportation Electrification Plan ("TEP") 
 
 In September 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed an amendment to the 2021 joint IRP for the approval of a Distributed Resource Plan amendment to implement the state's first TEP pursuant to Section 51 of SB 448 and approve proposed tariffs and schedules to implement the TEP. The 2022 TEP outlines programs, investments and incentives to accelerate transportation electrification across Nevada. The Nevada Utilities proposed a budget of 348 million, which represents the maximum cost over the depreciable life of the TEP's programs and assets, to deploy the TEP in 2023 through 2024. A hearing related to the application for approval of the TEP was held in February 2023. 
 
 ON Line Temporary Rider ("ONTR") 
 
 In October 2021, Sierra Pacific filed an application with the PUCN for approval of the ONTR with corresponding updates to its electric rate tariffs to authorize recovery of the One Nevada Transmission Line ("ON Line") regulatory asset being accumulated as a result of the ON Line cost reallocation as well as the related on-going reallocated revenue requirement. Sierra Pacific's application would have, if approved by the PUCN as filed, resulted in a one-time rate increase of 28 million to be collected over a nine-month period starting on April 1, 2022. In March 2022, the PUCN issued an order directing Sierra Pacific to recover 14 million of the ON Line regulatory asset as a one-time rate increase collectable over a nine-month period effective April 1, 2022, with the expected remaining balance at December 31, 2022 to be included in rate base in the 2022 regulatory rate review for inclusion in the rates set in that case. In December 2022, the PUCN issued an order in the general rate review proceeding allowing for recovery of the remaining regulatory asset balance and directed Sierra Pacific to establish a regulatory liability for any over-collection of revenues from the ONTR rate rider which shall accrue carry charges. 
 
 Merger Application 
 
 In March 2022, the Nevada Utilities filed a joint application with the PUCN for authorization to merge Sierra Pacific with and into Nevada Power, with Nevada Power being the surviving entity. If approved by the PUCN as filed, Nevada Power will have two distinct electric service territories in northern and southern Nevada each with their own rates and one natural gas service territory in the Reno and Sparks area. In October 2022, all parties to the proceedings relating to the joint application entered into a Stipulation to delay the procedural schedule. The Nevada Utilities made a supplemental filing on December 30, 2022. An order is expected in the first half of 2023. 
 
 54 

Regulatory Rate Review 
 
 In June 2022, Sierra Pacific filed a regulatory rate review with the PUCN that requested an annual revenue increase of 88 million, or 9.7 . In addition, a filing was made to revise depreciation rates based on a study, the results of which are reflected in the proposed revenue requirement. In August 2022, Sierra Pacific filed an updated certification filing that updated the requested annual revenue increase to 77 million, or 8.5 . Parties to the docket filed testimony and supporting documentation in August and September 2022 while rebuttal testimony was filed in September and October 2022. Hearings in the cost of capital, revenue requirement, and rate design phases were held in September, October, and November 2022, respectively. In December 2022, the PUCN issued an order approving an increase in base rates of 58 million, effective January 1, 2023, reflecting a reduction in Sierra Pacific's requested rate of return, updated depreciation and amortization rates for its electric operations and updated time of use periods to reflect the changes in system costs due to the increased solar generation on the system. 
 
 BHE Pipeline Group 
 
 BHE GT S 
 
 In September 2021, EGTS filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective November 1, 2021. EGTS' previous general rate case was settled in 1998. EGTS proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately 1.1 billion, and requested increases in various rates, including general system storage rates by 85 and general system transmission rates by 60 . In October 2021, the FERC issued an order that accepted the November 1, 2021 effective date for certain changes in rates, while suspending the other changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until April 1, 2022, subject to refund. In September 2022, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving EGTS' general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and decreased depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, EGTS' rates result in an increase to annual firm transmission and storage revenues of approximately 160 million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately 30 million, compared to the rates in effect prior to April 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, EGTS' provision for rate refund for April 2022 through December 2022 totaled 90 million and was included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2022, the FERC approved the settlement agreement. 
 
 In January 2020, pursuant to the terms of a previous settlement, Cove Point filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective March 1, 2020. Cove Point proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately 182 million. In February 2020, the FERC approved suspending the changes in rates for five months following the proposed effective date, until August 1, 2020, subject to refund. In November 2020, Cove Point reached an agreement in principle with the active participants in the general rate case proceeding. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, Cove Point's rates effective August 1, 2020 resulted in an increase to annual revenues of approximately 4 million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately 1 million, compared to the rates in effect prior to August 1, 2020. The interim settlement rates were implemented November 1, 2020, and Cove Point's provision for rate refunds for August 2020 through October 2020 totaled 7 million. The agreement in principle was reflected in a stipulation and agreement filed with the FERC in January 2021. In March 2021, the FERC approved the stipulation and agreement and the rate refunds to customers were processed in late April 2021. 
 
 Northern Natural Gas 
 
 In July 2022, Northern Natural Gas filed a general rate case that proposed an overall annual cost-of-service of 1.3 billion. This is an increase of 323 million above the cost of service filed in its 2019 rate case of 1.0 billion. Depreciation on increased rate base and an increase in depreciation and negative salvage rates account for 115 million of the 323 million increase in the filed cost of service. Northern Natural Gas has requested increases in various rates, including transportation and storage reservation rates. In January 2023, the FERC approved Northern Natural Gas filing to implement its interim rates effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund and the outcome of hearing procedures.

BHE Transmission 
 
 AltaLink 
 
 2022-2023 General Tariff Application 
 
 In April 2021, AltaLink filed its 2022-2023 GTA delivering on the last two years of its commitment to keep rates flat for customers at or below the 2018 level of C 904 million for the five-year period from 2019 to 2023. The two-year application achieves flat tariffs by continuing to transition to the AUC-approved salvage recovery method and continuing the use of the flow-through income tax method, with an overall year-over-year increase of approximately 2 in 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements. AltaLink's 2022-2023 GTA reflected its continued commitment to provide rate stability to customers by maintaining flat tariffs and providing additional tariff relief measures, including a proposed tariff refund of C 60 million of accumulated depreciation in each of 2022 and 2023. The application requested the approval of transmission tariffs of C 824 million and C 847 million for 2022 and 2023, respectively after proposed refunds. In September 2021, AltaLink provided responses to information requests from the AUC and filed an amended application to reflect certain adjustments and forecast updates. 
 
 In January 2022, the AUC issued its decision with respect to AltaLink's 2022-2023 GTA. The AUC did not approve AltaLink's proposed refund due to an anticipated improvement in general economic conditions in Alberta. In March 2022, AltaLink filed a review and variance application requesting the AUC to review and vary its decision to deny AltaLink's proposed C 120 million refund of accumulated depreciation surplus, given material changes in circumstances since the decision was issued in January 2022. In May 2022, the AUC issued a decision with respect to AltaLink's application to review and vary its proposed 120 million refund of accumulated depreciation surplus. The AUC did not agree that the Alberta economy had materially deteriorated and determined that the long-term costs outweigh the short-term benefits of the refund. 
 
 In July 2022, AltaLink submitted its second compliance filing application with total 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements at C 879 million and C 883 million, respectively. In August 2022, the AUC approved the revised revenue requirements as filed, allowing AltaLink to fully deliver on its flat-for-five commitment to customers. 
 
 Generic Cost of Capital Proceeding 
 
 In January 2022, the AUC initiated the 2023 generic cost of capital proceeding. The proceeding will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will determine the cost of capital parameters for 2023 and the second stage will consider returning to a formula-based approach to establish cost of capital adjustments, commencing in 2024. In March 2022, the AUC issued its decision with respect to the first stage of the 2023 GCOC proceeding by approving the extension of the 2022 return on equity of 8.5 and deemed equity ratio of 37 for 2023, recognizing lingering uncertainty and continued volatility of financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2022, the AUC initiated the second stage to explore a formula-based approach to determine the return on equity for 2024 and future test periods. 
 
 BHE U.S. Transmission 
 
 A significant portion of ETT's revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base regulatory rate review scheduled for no later than February 1, 2025. In February 2023, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ("PUCT") approved ETT's request to suspend a base regulatory rate review filing scheduled for February 2023. Results of a base regulatory rate review would be prospective except for any deemed disallowance by the PUCT of the transmission investment since the initial base regulatory rate review in 2007. In June 2018, the PUCT approved ETT's application to reduce its transmission revenue by 28 million to reflect the lower federal income tax rate due to 2017 Tax Reform with the amortization of excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes expected to be addressed in the next base rate case.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
 
 Each Registrant is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact each Registrant's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. Each Registrant believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. 
 
 The Company has cumulative investments in (i) owned wind, solar and geothermal generating facilities of 31.6 billion and (ii) wind tax equity investments of 5.8 billion and has retired 16 coal-fueled generation facilities. As a result, as of December 31 2022, the Company reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 27 as compared to 2005 levels. The Company plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation and storage in the future, including (i) 6.4 billion on the construction of renewable generating facilities and repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities through 2025 and (ii) 1.3 billion on the construction of electric battery and pumped hydro storage facilities through 2025, and to retire an additional 16 coal-fueled generation facilities between 2023 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50 reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of each respective Registrant in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for discussion of each Registrant's renewable generation-related capital expenditures. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "2022 Act") was signed into law. The 2022 Act contains numerous provisions, including expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 15 corporate alternative minimum income tax on "adjusted financial statement income". The provisions of the 2022 Act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company currently does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company expects future guidance from the Treasury Department and will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 Act as more guidance becomes available. 
 
 Air Quality Regulations 
 
 The Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation's air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE's generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
 
 Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets minimum NAAQS for six principal pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide, lead, NO x , particulate matter, ozone and SO 2 , considered harmful to public health and the environment. Areas that achieve the standards, as determined by ambient air quality monitoring, are characterized as being in attainment, while those that fail to meet the standards are designated as being nonattainment areas. Generally, sources of emissions in a nonattainment area that are determined to contribute to the nonattainment are required to reduce emissions. Currently, with the exceptions described in the following paragraphs, air quality monitoring data indicates that all counties where the relevant Registrant's major emission sources are located are in attainment of the current NAAQS. 
 
 57 

On June 4, 2018, the EPA published final ozone designations for much of the U.S. Relevant to the Registrants, these designations include classifying Yuma County, Arizona; Clark County, Nevada; and the Northern Wasatch Front, Southern Wasatch Front and Duchesne and Uintah counties in Utah as nonattainment-marginal with the 2015 ozone standard. These areas were required to meet the 2015 standard three years from the August 3, 2018, effective date. All other areas relevant to the Registrants were designated attainment/unclassifiable with this same action. However, on January 29, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated several provisions of the 2018 implementing rules for the 2015 ozone standards for contravening the Clean Air Act. The EPA and environmental groups finalized a consent decree in January 2022 that sets deadlines for the agency to approve or disapprove the "good neighbor" provisions of interstate ozone plans of dozens of states. Relevant to the Registrants, the EPA must, by April 30, 2022, propose to approve or disapprove the interstate ozone SIPs of Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin. On February 22, 2022, the EPA published a series of proposed decisions to disapprove the SIPs for interstate ozone transport of 19 states. Relevant to the Registrants, these states include Alabama, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The EPA also proposed to approve Iowa's SIP after re-analyzing the state's data. In addition, the EPA must approve or disapprove the interstate plans of Arizona, California, Nevada and Wyoming. On April 15, 2022 the EPA issued its final rule approving Iowa's SIP as meeting the good neighbor provisions for the 2015 ozone standard. On May 24, 2022 the EPA disapproved the Utah and Wyoming interstate ozone SIPs. On January 30, 2023, the EPA entered into a stipulated extension to the deadline for action on the Wyoming SIP, setting a new deadline of December 15, 2023. The EPA explained that the extra time is needed to fully consider updated air quality information and public comments. The EPA is also reevaluating SIPs for Tennessee and Arizona. On January 31, 2023, the EPA issued final disapproval of the 19 SIPs proposed in April 2022, setting the stage to include those states in the federal implementation plan described under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. Separately, on March 28, 2022, the EPA proposed determinations as to whether certain areas have achieved levels of ground-level ozone pollution that meet the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. Relevant to Registrants, the Southern Wasatch Front in Utah and Yuma, Arizona are proposed to have met the 2015 ozone standard; and the Cincinnati area of Ohio and Kentucky and the Northern Wasatch Front in Utah are proposed to have not met the 2015 ozone, will be reclassified as Moderate Non-Attainment, and will have until August 3, 2024 to meet the standard. Until the EPA takes final action on the proposal and the affected states submit any required SIPs, the relevant Registrants cannot determine the impacts of the proposed rule. 
 
 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
 
 The EPA promulgated an initial rule in March 2005 to reduce emissions of NO x and SO 2 , precursors of ozone and particulate matter, from down-wind sources in the eastern U.S. to reduce emissions by implementing a plan based on a market-based cap-and-trade system, emissions reductions, or both. After numerous appeals, the CSAPR was promulgated to address interstate transport of SO 2 and NO x emissions in 27 Eastern and Midwestern states. In March 2022, the EPA released its Good Neighbor Rule, which contains proposed revisions to the CSAPR framework and is intended to address ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The rule focuses on reductions of NO x and covers 26 states. Relevant to the Registrants, four states are included in the cross-state program for the first time - California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. The EPA proposes to retain emissions allowance trading for generating facilities. Beginning in 2023, emissions budgets would be set at the level of reductions achievable through immediately available measures such as consistently operating existing emissions controls. Starting in 2026, emissions budgets would be set at levels achievable by the installation of SCR controls at certain generating facilities. The proposal also includes additional industries beyond the power sector for the first time, with a focus on the top NO x emitting stationary source categories. These include natural gas pipeline compressor stations, among others. These sources will not have access to trading and will instead be subject to rate-based limits that are assigned for each source category. The EPA accepted comments on the proposal through June 21, 2022. On February 1, 2023, the EPA released updated air transport modeling that indicates two states, Delaware and Wyoming, do not significantly contribute to downwind maintenance receptors; and that four states, Arizona, Iowa, Kansas and New Mexico, in fact do significantly contribute to downwind maintenance receptors. It is anticipated that the EPA will rely on this updated modeling in the final good neighbor rule, which it intends to finalize in March 2023. Additional notice and comment rulemaking, such as a supplemental rule, would be required to rescind Iowa's approved SIP and incorporate additional states into the program. Until the EPA takes final action consistent with this decree, impacts to the relevant Registrants cannot be determined. 
 
 Regional Haze 
 
 The EPA's Regional Haze Rule, finalized in 1999, requires states to develop and implement plans to improve visibility in designated federally protected areas ("Class I areas"). Some of PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado and certain of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's fossil-fueled generating facilities are subject to the Clean Air Visibility Rules. In accordance with the federal requirements, states are required to submit SIPs that address emissions from sources subject to BART requirements and demonstrate progress towards achieving natural visibility requirements in Class I areas by 2064. 
 
 58 

In June 2019, the state of Utah incorporated a BART alternative into its SIP for regional haze planning period one. The BART alternative makes the shutdown of PacifiCorp's Carbon generating facility enforceable under the SIP and removes the requirement to install SCR equipment on Hunter Units 1 and 2 and Huntington Units 1 and 2. The EPA approved the SIP revision with the BART alternative in October 2020. The EPA's actions also withdrew a prior FIP that required installation of SCR equipment on Hunter Units 1 and 2 and Huntington Units 1 and 2. On January 19, 2021, Heal Utah, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club and Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment filed a petition for review of the Utah Regional Haze SIP Alternative in the Tenth Circuit. PacifiCorp and the state of Utah moved to intervene in the litigation. After review of the rule by the Biden administration, the EPA determined it would defend the rule and briefing has been completed. A date for oral arguments has not been scheduled. The Utah Air Quality Board approved the Utah Division of Air Quality's SIP for the regional haze second planning period on June 6, 2022. The SIP sets mass-based NO x emissions limits and rate-based SO 2 limits for PacifiCorp's Hunter and Huntington generating facilities to ensure reasonable visibility progress for the second planning period. 
 
 The state of Wyoming issued two regional haze SIPs requiring the installation of SO 2 , NO x and particulate matter controls on certain PacifiCorp coal-fueled generating facilities in Wyoming. The EPA approved the SO 2 SIP in December 2012 and the EPA's approval was upheld on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in October 2014. The EPA's final action on the Wyoming SIP in 2014 approved the state's plan to have PacifiCorp install low-NO x burners at Naughton Units 1 and 2, SCR controls at Naughton Unit 3 by December 2014, SCR controls at Jim Bridger Units 1 through 4 between 2015 and 2022, and low-NO x burners at Dave Johnston Unit 4. The EPA disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for Dave Johnston Unit 3, where it required the installation of SCR controls by 2019 or, in lieu of installing SCR controls, a commitment to shut down Dave Johnston Unit 3 by 2027, its currently approved depreciable life. The EPA also disapproved a portion of the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for the Wyodak coal-fueled generating facility, requiring the installation of SCR controls by 2019. PacifiCorp filed an appeal of the EPA's final action on Wyodak in March 2014. The state of Wyoming and several environmental groups also filed an appeal of the EPA's final action. In September 2014, the Tenth Circuit issued a stay of the March 2019 compliance deadline for Wyodak, pending further action by the Tenth Circuit in the appeal. The abatement on litigation was lifted September 28, 2022, and opening briefs were submitted in October 2022. PacifiCorp objects to the EPA's FIP requiring SCR on the Wyodak Unit. That requirement in the agency's plan remains stayed by the court. PacifiCorp has also intervened on behalf of the EPA against claims that Naughton Units 1 and 2 should have been subject to a SCR requirement. Separately, on February 14, 2022, the First Judicial District Court for the State of Wyoming entered a consent decree reached between the state of Wyoming and PacifiCorp resolving claims of threatened violations of the Clean Air Act, the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations at the Jim Bridger facility. No penalties were imposed under the consent decree. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the consent decree, PacifiCorp must convert both units to natural gas and begin meeting emissions limits consistent with that conversion by January 1, 2024. The EPA and PacifiCorp executed an administrative order on consent June 9, 2022, covering compliance for Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 under the regional haze rule. The federal order contains the same emission and operating limits as the Wyoming consent decree and adds federal approval of the compliance pathway outlined in the state consent decree, including revision of the SIP to include conversion of Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 to natural gas. The order includes a one-year deadline to complete the SIP revision. On December 30, 2022, the Wyoming Air Quality Division submitted the state-approved revised regional haze state implementation plan requiring natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 to the EPA for approval. The plan revision replaces a previous requirement for selective catalytic reduction at the units. The Wyoming Air Quality Division also issued an air permit for the natural gas conversion of Jim Bridger units 1 and 2 on December 28, 2022. The EPA is expected to conduct a separate federal public comment process on the plan. For the second round of regional haze planning, Wyoming determined that no controls will be necessary on any Wyoming resources to make reasonable progress. 
 
 The state of Colorado regional haze SIP requires SCR equipment at Craig Unit 2 and Hayden Units 1 and 2, in which PacifiCorp has ownership interests. Each of those regional haze compliance projects are in-service. In addition, in February 2015, the state of Colorado finalized an amendment to its regional haze SIP relating to Craig Unit 1, in which PacifiCorp has an ownership interest, to require the installation of SCR controls by 2021. In September 2016, the owners of Craig Units 1 and 2 reached an agreement with state and federal agencies and certain environmental groups that were parties to the previous settlement requiring SCR to retire Unit 1 by December 31, 2025, in lieu of SCR installation, or alternatively to remove the unit from coal-fueled service by August 31, 2021 with an option to convert the unit to natural gas by August 31, 2023, in lieu of SCR installation. The terms of the agreement were approved by the Colorado Air Quality Board in December 2016, incorporated into an amended Colorado regional haze SIP in 2017 and approved by the EPA in August 2018. PacifiCorp identified a December 31, 2025, retirement date for Craig Unit 1 in its 2017 and 2019 IRPs. 
 
 59 

Nevada, Utah and Wyoming each submitted regional haze SIPs for the regional haze second planning period to the EPA in August 2022. The EPA has 18 months to approve or disapprove all or parts of the states' plans. On August 25, 2022, the EPA promulgated a finding of failure to submit a SIP for the regional haze second planning period for 15 states, including Iowa. The finding establishes a two-year deadline for the agency to promulgate FIPs to address the requirements, unless prior to promulgating a FIP, the state submits, and the agency approves, a SIP meeting the requirements. The finding says the agency intends to continue to work with states in developing approvable SIP submittals in a timely manner. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources continues to work with the EPA on development of its SIP. On February 13, 2023, Iowa issued a draft SIP and will accept comment on the draft plan through March 16, 2023. Iowa proposes to require operational improvements to existing control equipment at MidAmerican Energy Company's Louisa Generation Station and Walter Scott Jr. Energy Center - Unit 3. Iowa anticipates submitting a final plan to the EPA in spring 2023. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions 26 to 28 by 2025 from 2005 levels. After more than 55 countries representing more than 55 of global GHG emissions submitted their ratification documents, the Paris Agreement became effective November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions 50 to 52 from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100 carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.

GHG Performance Standards 
 
 Affordable Clean Energy Rule 
 
 In June 2014, the EPA released proposed regulations to address GHG emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating facilities, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA's proposal calculated state-specific emission rate targets to be achieved based on the "best system of emission reduction." In August 2015, the final Clean Power Plan was released, which established the best system of emission reduction as including: (a) heat rate improvements; (b) increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c) increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in-service after 2012. The Clean Power Plan was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2016 while litigation proceeded. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emission reduction for existing coal-fueled generating facilities is limited to actions that can be taken at a point source facility, specifically heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The Affordable Clean Energy rule was challenged by environmental and health groups in the D.C. Circuit. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the Affordable Clean Energy rule to the EPA, finding that the rule "rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act" that limited the best system of emission reduction to actions taken at a facility. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case were held February 28, 2022, and on June 30, 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the "generation shifting" approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress, although the court did not address whether the EPA may only adopt measures applied at the individual source as it did in the Affordable Clean Energy rule. A key area where the EPA went astray was using the Clean Power Plan to give states the option to promulgate regulations that would encourage "generation shifting," or moving away from higher-polluting power sources like coal to lower-polluting sources like natural gas or renewables. The U.S. Supreme Court found that type of regulation, which would impact larger economic forces beyond the fence lines of individual generating facilities, is not permitted under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's vacatur of the Affordable Clean Energy rule and remanded the case for further proceedings. The ruling has no immediate impact on the Registrants, as there is no Section 111(d) rule currently in effect. The Biden administration plans to propose by March 2023 its own rule to replace the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule. 
 
 New Source Performance Standards for Methane Emissions 
 
 In August 2020, the EPA finalized regulations to rescind standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The changes eliminate requirements to regulate methane emissions from the production, processing, transmission and storage of oil and gas. The rule was immediately challenged by environmental and tribal groups, as well as numerous states. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit lifted an administrative stay and allowed the rule to take effect, finding that groups challenging the rule had not met the standard for a long-term stay. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress, adopted under the Congressional Review Act, disapproving the August 2020 rule. The resolution reinstated the 2012 volatile organic compounds standards and the 2016 volatile organic compounds and methane standards for the oil and natural gas transmission and storage segments, as well as the methane standards for the production and processing segments of the oil and gas sector. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA took comment on the proposed rules through January 31, 2022. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission reduction requirements and intends to finalize the rules by fall 2023. Until the rules are finalized, the relevant Registrants cannot determine the full impacts of the proposed rule.

Water Quality Standards 
 
 The Clean Water Act establishes the framework for maintaining and improving water quality in the U.S. through a program that regulates, among other things, discharges to and withdrawals from waterways. The Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the "best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact" to aquatic organisms. After significant litigation, the EPA released a proposed rule under 316(b) of the Clean Water Act to regulate cooling water intakes at existing facilities. The final rule was released in May 2014 and became effective in October 2014. Under the final rule, existing facilities that withdraw at least 25 of their water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day are required to reduce fish impingement (i.e., when fish and other aquatic organisms are trapped against screens when water is drawn into a facility's cooling system) by choosing one of seven options. Facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons of water per day from waters of the U.S. must also conduct studies to help their permitting authority determine what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms (i.e., when organisms are drawn into the facility). PacifiCorp's Dave Johnston generating facility and all of MidAmerican Energy's coal-fueled generating facilities, except Louisa, Ottumwa and Walter Scott, Jr. Unit 4, which have water cooling towers, withdraw more than 125 million gallons per day of water from waters of the U.S. for once-through cooling applications. PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger, Naughton, Gadsby, Hunter and Huntington generating facilities currently utilize closed cycle cooling towers but are designed to withdraw more than two million gallons of water per day. If PacifiCorp's or MidAmerican Energy's existing intake structures require modification, the costs are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific are not impacted by the 316(b) final rule since they do not utilize once-through cooling water intake or discharge structures at any of their generating facilities. 
 
 In November 2015, the EPA published final effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating sector which, among other things, regulate the discharge of bottom ash transport water, fly ash transport water, combustion residual leachate and non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. In November 2019, the EPA proposed updates to the 2015 rule, specifically addressing flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The rule took effect in December 2020. The final rule changes the technology-basis for treatment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water, revises the voluntary incentives program for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, and adds subcategories for high-flow units, low utilization units, and those that will transition away from coal combustion by 2028. While most of the issues raised by this rule are already being addressed through the CCR rule and are not expected to impose significant additional requirements, the Dave Johnston generating facility is impacted by the rule's bottom ash handling requirements at Units 1 and 2. The generating facility submitted notice to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality that it will either achieve a cessation of coal combustion at Units 1 and 2 by December 31, 2028, or install bottom ash transport treatment technology by December 31, 2025. The EPA anticipates proposing additional changes to the rule in spring 2023 to resolve outstanding issues from litigation. 
 
 In April 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") issued a joint proposal to address "waters of the United States" to clarify protection under the Clean Water Act for streams and wetlands. The proposed rule comes as a result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that created confusion regarding jurisdictional waters that were subject to permitting under either nationwide or individual permitting requirements. The final rule was released in May 2015 but was appealed in multiple courts and a nationwide stay on the implementation of the rule was issued in October 2015. On June 9, 2021, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers announced their intention to again revise the definition of "waters of the United States." In December 2022, the agencies released a final rule updating the definition of "waters of the United States." The final rule generally restores and is broader than the pre-2015 "waters of the United States" definition and incorporates both the "relatively permanent" and "significant nexus" standards from U.S. Supreme Court decisions. 
 
 Coal Ash Disposal 
 
 In April 2015, the EPA released a final rule to regulate the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) under the RCRA. The rule regulates coal combustion byproducts as non-hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle D and establishes minimum nationwide standards for the disposal of CCR. Under the final rule, surface impoundments and landfills utilized for coal combustion byproducts will need to be closed unless they can meet the more stringent regulatory requirements. 
 
 62 

At the time the rule was published in April 2015, PacifiCorp operated 18 surface impoundments and seven landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, nine surface impoundments and three landfills were either closed or repurposed to no longer receive coal combustion byproducts and hence are not subject to the final rule. As PacifiCorp proceeded to implement the final coal combustion rule, it was determined that two surface impoundments located at the Dave Johnston generating facility were hydraulically connected and effectively constitute a single impoundment. In November 2017, a new surface impoundment was placed into service at the Naughton Generating Station. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, MidAmerican Energy owned or operated nine surface impoundments and four landfills that contain coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, MidAmerican Energy closed or repurposed six surface impoundments to no longer receive coal combustion byproducts. Five of these surface impoundments were closed on or before December 21, 2017, and the sixth is undergoing closure. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, the Nevada Utilities operated 10 evaporative surface impoundments and two landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date of the rule in October 2015, the Nevada Utilities closed four of the surface impoundments, four impoundments discontinued receipt of coal combustion byproducts making them inactive and two surface impoundments remain active and subject to the final rule. The two landfills remain active and subject to the final rule. 
 
 Multiple parties filed challenges over various aspects of the final rule in the D.C. Circuit, resulting in settlement of some of the issues and subsequent regulatory action by the EPA. The EPA finalized the first phase of the CCR rule amendments in July 2018 (the "Phase 1, Part 1 rule"). In addition to adopting alternative performance standards and revising groundwater performance standards for certain constituents, the EPA extended the deadline by which facilities must initiate closure of unlined ash ponds exceeding a groundwater protection standard and impoundments that do not meet the rule's aquifer location restrictions to October 31, 2020. Following submittal of competing motions from environmental groups and the EPA to stay or remand this deadline extension, on March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to remand the rule and left the October 31, 2020 deadline in place while the agency undertakes a new rulemaking establishing a new deadline for initiating closure. On August 14, 2019, the EPA released its "Phase 2" proposal, which contains targeted amendments to the CCR rule in response to court remands and EPA settlement agreements, as well as issues raised in a rulemaking petition. The Phase 2 rule has not been finalized. In February 2020, the EPA proposed a federal CCR permit program as required by the WIIN Act of 2016. The federal permit rule has not been finalized. In October 2020, the EPA released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on legacy CCR surface impoundments, seeking comment on and information related to issues relevant to development of regulations for legacy impoundments. The EPA has not undertaken additional rulemaking related to the advanced notice. Until the proposals are finalized and fully litigated, the Registrants cannot determine whether additional action may be required. 
 
 In August 2020, the EPA finalized its Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule ("Part A rule"). This proposal addressed the D.C. Circuit's revocation of the provisions that allow unlined impoundments to continue receiving ash. The Part A rule established a new deadline of April 11, 2021, by which all unlined surface impoundments must initiate closure. The Part A rule also identifies two extensions to that date: (1) a site-specific extension to develop alternate disposal capacity and initiate closure by October 15, 2023; and (2) a site-specific extension for facilities that agree to shut down the coal-fueled unit and complete ash pond closure activities by October 17, 2028. PacifiCorp developed a demonstration for the development of alternative capacity for the Jim Bridger facility's FGD Pond 2 and a demonstration for closure of the Naughton facility and ash pond and submitted them to the EPA in November 2020. On January 11, 2022, the EPA deemed these submittals complete but has not taken additional action on them. No other Registrants used the provisions of the Part A rule. 
 
 Notwithstanding the status of the final CCR rule, citizens' suits have been filed against regulated entities seeking judicial relief for contamination alleged to have been caused by releases of coal combustion byproducts. Some of these cases have been successful in imposing liability upon companies if coal combustion byproducts contaminate groundwater that is ultimately released or connected to surface water. In addition, actions have been filed against regulated entities seeking to require that surface impoundments containing CCR be subject to closure by removal rather than being allowed to effectuate closure in place as provided under the final rule. The Registrants are not a party to these lawsuits and until they are resolved, the Registrants cannot predict the impact on overall compliance obligations.

Other 
 
 Other laws, regulations and agencies to which the relevant Registrants are subject include, but are not limited to: 
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state laws may require any current or former owners or operators of a disposal site, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous substances sent to such disposal site, to share in environmental remediation costs. Certain Registrants have been identified as potentially responsible parties in connection with certain disposal sites. The relevant Registrants have completed several cleanup actions and are participating in ongoing investigations and remedial actions. Costs associated with these actions are not expected to be material and are expected to be found prudent and included in rates. 
 The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, under which the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements of MidAmerican Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding MidAmerican Energy's nuclear decommissioning obligations. 
 The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of PacifiCorp's mining activities. 
 The FERC evaluates hydroelectric systems to ensure environmental impacts are minimized, including the issuance of environmental impact statements for licensed projects both initially and upon relicensing. The FERC monitors the hydroelectric facilities for compliance with the license terms and conditions, which include environmental provisions. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system. 
 
 The Registrants expect they will be allowed to recover their respective prudently incurred costs to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed above. The Registrants' planning efforts take into consideration the complexity of balancing factors such as: (a) pending environmental regulations and requirements to reduce emissions, address waste disposal, ensure water quality and protect wildlife; (b) avoidance of excessive reliance on any one generation technology; (c) costs and trade-offs of various resource options including energy efficiency, demand response programs and renewable generation; (d) state-specific energy policies, resource preferences and economic development efforts; (e) additional transmission investment to reduce power costs and increase efficiency and reliability of the integrated transmission system; and (f) keeping rates affordable. Due to the number of generating units impacted by environmental regulations, deferring installation of compliance-related projects is often not feasible or cost effective and places the Registrants at risk of not having access to necessary capital, material, and labor while attempting to perform major equipment installations in a compressed timeframe concurrent with other utilities across the country. Therefore, the Registrants have established installation schedules with permitting agencies that coordinate compliance timeframes with construction and tie-in of major environmental compliance projects as units are scheduled off-line for planned maintenance outages; these coordinated efforts help reduce costs associated with replacement power and maintain system reliability. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Each Registrant is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described below. Careful consideration of these risks, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and the other public information filed by the relevant Registrant, should be made before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which each Registrant currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. Unless stated otherwise, the risks described below generally relate to each Registrant.

Corporate and Financial Structure Risks 
 
 BHE is a holding company and depends on distributions from subsidiaries, including joint ventures, to meet its obligations. 
 
 BHE is a holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests in its subsidiaries and joint ventures, collectively referred to as its subsidiaries. Accordingly, cash flows and the ability to meet BHE's obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the payment of such earnings to BHE in the form of dividends or other distributions. BHE's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due pursuant to BHE's senior debt, junior subordinated debt or its other obligations, or to make funds available, whether by dividends or other payments, for the payment of amounts due pursuant to BHE's senior debt, junior subordinated debt or its other obligations, and do not guarantee the payment of any of its obligations. Distributions from subsidiaries may also be limited by: 
 their respective earnings, capital requirements, and required debt and preferred stock payments; 
 the satisfaction of certain terms contained in financing, ring-fencing or organizational documents; and 
 regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of BHE's regulated utility subsidiaries to distribute profits. 
 
 BHE is substantially leveraged, the terms of its existing senior and junior subordinated debt do not restrict the incurrence of additional debt by BHE or its subsidiaries, and BHE's senior debt is structurally subordinated to the debt of its subsidiaries, and each of such factors could adversely affect BHE's consolidated financial results. 
 
 A significant portion of BHE's capital structure is comprised of debt, and BHE expects to incur additional debt in the future to fund items such as, among others, acquisitions, capital investments and the development and construction of new or expanded facilities. As of December 31, 2022, BHE had the following outstanding obligations: 
 senior unsecured debt of 14.0 billion; 
 junior subordinated debentures of 100 million; 
 guarantees and letters of credit in respect of subsidiaries, equity method investments and other related parties aggregating 1.6 billion; and 
 
 BHE's consolidated subsidiaries also have significant amounts of outstanding debt, which totaled 38.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. These amounts exclude (a) trade debt, (b) preferred stock obligations, (c) letters of credit in respect of subsidiary debt, and (d) BHE's share of the outstanding debt of its own or its subsidiaries' equity method investments. 
 
 Given BHE's substantial leverage, it may not have sufficient cash to service its debt, which could limit its ability to finance future acquisitions, develop and construct additional projects, or operate successfully under difficult conditions, including those brought on by adverse national and global economies, unfavorable financial markets or growth conditions where its capital needs may exceed its ability to fund them. BHE's leverage could also impair its credit quality or the credit quality of its subsidiaries, making it more difficult to finance operations or issue future debt on favorable terms, and could result in a downgrade in debt ratings by credit rating agencies. 
 
 The terms of BHE's and its subsidiaries' debt do not limit BHE's ability or the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock. Accordingly, BHE or its subsidiaries could enter into acquisitions, new financings, refinancings, recapitalizations, leases or other highly leveraged transactions that could significantly increase BHE's or its subsidiaries' total amount of outstanding debt. The interest payments needed to service this increased level of debt could adversely affect BHE's or its subsidiaries' financial results. Many of BHE's subsidiaries' debt agreements contain covenants, or may in the future contain covenants, that restrict or limit, among other things, such subsidiaries' ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, incur additional debt or miss contractual deadlines or requirements, and BHE's ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control. Further, if an event of default accelerates a repayment obligation and such acceleration results in an event of default under some or all of BHE's other debt, BHE may not have sufficient funds to repay all of the accelerated debt simultaneously, and the other risks described under "Corporate and Financial Structure Risks" may be magnified as well. 
 
 65 

Because BHE is a holding company, the claims of its senior debt holders are structurally subordinated with respect to the assets and earnings of its subsidiaries. Therefore, the rights of its creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary in the event of a liquidation or reorganization are subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors and preferred shareholders, if any. In addition, pursuant to separate financing agreements, substantially all of PacifiCorp's electric utility properties, MidAmerican Energy's electric utility properties in the state of Iowa, Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's properties in the state of Nevada, AltaLink's transmission properties, the equity interest of MidAmerican Funding's subsidiary and substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries of BHE Renewables that are direct or indirect owners of solar and wind generation projects, are directly or indirectly pledged to secure their financings and, therefore, may be unavailable as potential sources of repayment of BHE's debt. 
 
 A downgrade in BHE's credit ratings or the credit ratings of its subsidiaries, including the Subsidiary Registrants, could negatively affect BHE's or its subsidiaries' access to capital, increase the cost of borrowing or raise energy transaction credit support requirements. 
 
 BHE's senior unsecured debt and its subsidiaries' long-term debt, including the Subsidiary Registrants, are rated by various rating agencies. BHE cannot give assurance that its senior unsecured debt rating or any of its subsidiaries' long-term debt ratings will not be reduced in the future. Although none of the Registrants' outstanding debt has rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate a repayment obligation, a credit rating downgrade would increase any such Registrant's borrowing costs and commitment fees on its revolving credit agreements and other financing arrangements, perhaps significantly. In addition, such Registrant would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited, resulting in higher interest costs. 
 
 Similarly, any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of BHE's subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited, which in turn could cause BHE to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing its and its subsidiaries' liquidity and borrowing capacity. 
 
 Most of the Registrants' large wholesale customers, suppliers and counterparties require such Registrant to have sufficient creditworthiness in order to enter into transactions, particularly in the wholesale energy markets. If the credit ratings of a Registrant were to decline, especially below investment grade, the relevant Registrant's financing costs and borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or some other form of security for existing transactions and as a condition to entering into future transactions with such Registrant. Amounts could be material and could adversely affect such Registrant's liquidity and cash flows. 
 
 BHE's majority shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway, could exercise control over BHE in a manner that would benefit Berkshire Hathaway to the detriment of BHE's creditors and BHE could exercise control over the Subsidiary Registrants in a manner that would benefit BHE to the detriment of the Subsidiary Registrants' creditors and PacifiCorp's preferred stockholders. 
 
 Berkshire Hathaway is majority owner of BHE and has control over all decisions requiring shareholder approval. In circumstances involving a conflict of interest between Berkshire Hathaway and BHE's creditors, Berkshire Hathaway could exercise its control in a manner that would benefit Berkshire Hathaway to the detriment of BHE's creditors. 
 
 BHE indirectly owns all of the common stock of PacifiCorp, Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific and EGTS and the membership interest in Eastern Energy Gas. BHE is also the sole member of MidAmerican Funding and, accordingly, indirectly owns all of MidAmerican Energy's common stock. As a result, BHE has control over all decisions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors. In circumstances involving a conflict of interest between BHE and the creditors of the Subsidiary Registrants, BHE could exercise its control in a manner that would benefit BHE to the detriment of the Subsidiary Registrants' creditors. 
 
 Business Risks 
 
 Much of BHE's growth has been achieved through acquisitions, and any such acquisition may not be successful. 
 
 Much of BHE's growth has been achieved through acquisitions. Future acquisitions may range from buying individual assets to the purchase of entire businesses. BHE will continue to investigate and pursue opportunities for future acquisitions that it believes, but cannot assure, may increase value and expand or complement existing businesses. BHE may participate in bidding or other negotiations at any time for such acquisition opportunities which may or may not be successful. 
 
 66 

An acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of BHE's subsidiaries. In addition, the final orders of regulatory authorities approving acquisitions may be subject to appeal by third parties. The diversion of BHE management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the approval and integration of the acquired operations could adversely affect BHE's combined businesses and financial results and could impair its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 
 
 BHE cannot assure that future acquisitions, if any, or any integration efforts will be successful, or that BHE's ability to repay its obligations will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. 
 
 The Registrants are subject to operating uncertainties and events beyond each respective Registrant's control that impact the costs to operate, maintain, repair and replace utility and interstate natural gas pipeline systems and the ability to self-insure many risks, which could adversely affect each respective Registrant's financial results. 
 
 The operation of complex utility systems or interstate natural gas pipeline and storage systems that are spread over large geographic areas involves many operating uncertainties and events beyond each respective Registrant's control. These potential events include the breakdown or failure of the Registrants' thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind and other electricity generating facilities and related equipment, compressors, pipelines, transmission and distribution lines and associated electric operations equipment or other equipment or processes, which could lead to catastrophic events; unscheduled outages; strikes, lockouts, other labor-related actions or shortages of qualified labor, including with respect to the Registrants' suppliers and vendors; transmission and distribution system constraints; failure to obtain, renew or maintain rights-of-way, easements and leases on U.S. federal, Native American, First Nations or tribal lands; terrorist activities or military or other actions, including cyber attacks; fuel shortages or interruptions; unavailability of critical equipment, materials and supplies; low water flows and other weather-related impacts; performance below expected levels of output, capacity or efficiency; operator error; third-party excavation errors; unexpected degradation of pipeline systems; design, construction or manufacturing defects; and catastrophic events such as severe storms, floods, fires, extreme temperature events, wind events, earthquakes, explosions, landslides, an electromagnetic pulse, mining incidents, costly litigation, wars, terrorism, pandemics and embargoes. A catastrophic event might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage, environmental or natural resource damages or excessive economic loss. For example, in the event of an uncontrolled release of water at one of PacifiCorp's high hazard potential hydroelectric dams, it is probable that loss of human life, disruption of lifeline facilities and property damage could occur in the downstream population and civil or other penalties could be imposed by the FERC. The extent of that liability would be determined by the applicable state law where any such damage occurred. Any of these events or other operational events could significantly reduce or eliminate the relevant Registrant's revenue or significantly increase its expenses, thereby reducing the availability of distributions to BHE. For example, if the relevant Registrant cannot operate its electricity or natural gas facilities at full capacity due to damage caused by a catastrophic event, its revenue could decrease and its expenses could increase due to the need to obtain energy from more expensive sources. 
 
 Further, the Registrants self-insure many risks, and current and future insurance coverage may not be sufficient to replace lost revenue or cover repair and replacement costs or other damages. The scope, cost and availability of each Registrant's insurance coverage may change, including the portion that is self-insured. 
 
 Any reduction of each Registrant's revenue or increase in its expenses resulting from the risks described above, could adversely affect the relevant Registrant's financial results. 
 
 The Registrants are subject to increasing risks from catastrophic wildfires and may be unable to obtain enough insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all and insurance coverage on existing wildfire claims could be insufficient to cover all losses should current estimates of those losses materially differ from the ultimate outcomes of the claims, all of which could materially affect the Registrants financial results and liquidity. 
 
 The risk of catastrophic and severe wildfires has increased in the western U.S. giving rise to the potential for large damage claims against utilities for fire-related losses. Catastrophic and severe wildfires can occur in PacifiCorp, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific's ("Western Domestic Utilities") service territories even when the Western Domestic Utilities effectively implement their wildfire mitigation plans and prudently manage their systems. 
 
 67 

In California, for example, where PacifiCorp operates, "inverse condemnation" currently exposes utilities to potential liability for property damages where the utility's electrical equipment was a substantial cause of the wildfire. California courts have held that utilities can be held liable under inverse condemnation without being found negligent and regardless of fault. California law also permits inverse condemnation plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees. As a result of inverse condemnation being applied to utilities and wildfire damages, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the frequency, duration and size of wildfires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive. In addition, even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available, it may not be available in amounts necessary to cover potential losses. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may be challenged when PacifiCorp seeks cost recovery and may not be recoverable in customer rates. 
 
 The Western Domestic Utilities monitor weather conditions with specific thresholds for designated high fire consequence areas to help ensure the safe and reliable operation of their systems during periods of elevated wildfire ignition risk. Should weather conditions become extreme, the Western Domestic Utilities may de-energize certain sections of their transmission and distribution facilities as a last resort to minimize risk to the public. These "public safety power shutoffs" could be subject to increased scrutiny by regulators and policy makers. And, although "public safety power shutoffs" are intended to minimize risk of wildfire ignition, de-energization may cause other damages for which the Western Domestic Utilities could be held liable. 
 
 Damage claims against PacifiCorp for wildfires may materially affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, private and public property damages, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California (the "2020 Wildfires"). Additionally, a major wildfire began in PacifiCorp's service territory in July 2022 causing private and public property damage, personal injuries, loss of life and power outages in Northern California (the "2022 McKinney Fire"). The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California. Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing. Several lawsuits and complaints have been filed in Oregon and California associated with the wildfires, and it is possible that additional lawsuits and complaints against PacifiCorp may be filed. If PacifiCorp is found liable for damages related to the 2020 Wildfires or the 2022 McKinney Fire and is unable to, or believes that it will be unable to, recover those damages through insurance or customer rates, or access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, PacifiCorp's financial results could be adversely affected. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings, BHE's Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and PacifiCorp's Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the 2020 Wildfires and the 2022 McKinney Fire. 
 
 Each Registrant's business could be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks. 
 
 Each Registrant's business could be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks generally and more specifically in the markets in which we operate, including, without limitation, if each Registrant's utility customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services or otherwise reduce their consumption of electricity or natural gas that the respective Registrant supplies, or if such Registrant experiences material payment defaults by its customers. In addition, each Registrant's results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local and foreign legislation related to such epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks (or other similar laws, regulations, orders or other governmental or regulatory actions) that would impose a moratorium on terminating electric or natural gas utility services, including related assessment of late fees, due to non-payment or other circumstances. Additionally, HomeServices' real estate businesses could experience a decline (which could be significant) in real estate transactions if potential customers elect to defer purchases in reaction to any epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak or due to general economic uncertainty such as high unemployment levels, in some or all of the real estate markets in which HomeServices operates. The government and regulators could impose other requirements on each Registrant's business that could have an adverse impact on such Registrant's financial results. 
 
 Further, epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks could disrupt supply chains (including supply chains for energy generation, steel or transmission wire) relating to the markets each Registrant serves, which could adversely impact such Registrant's ability to generate or supply power. In addition, such disruptions to the supply chain could delay certain construction and other capital expenditure projects, including construction and repowering of the Registrants' renewable generation projects. Such disruptions could adversely affect the impacted Registrant's future financial results. 
 
 Such declines in demand, any inability to generate or supply power or delays in capital projects could also significantly reduce cash flows at BHE's subsidiaries, thereby reducing the availability of distributions to BHE, which could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 68 

Each Registrant is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign legislation and regulation, including numerous environmental, health, safety, reliability, data privacy and other laws and regulations that affect its operations and costs. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. In addition, new laws and regulations, including initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the utility industry, are continually being proposed and enacted that impose new or revised requirements or standards on each Registrant. 
 
 Each Registrant is required to comply with numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations as described in "General Regulation" and "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K that have broad application to each Registrant and limits the respective Registrant's ability to independently make and implement management decisions regarding, among other items, acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; managing and reporting transactions between subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. These laws and regulations, which are followed in developing the Registrants' safety and compliance programs and procedures, are implemented and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the FERC, the EPA, the DOT, the NRC, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration and various state regulatory commissions in the U.S., and by foreign regulatory agencies, such as GEMA, which discharges certain of its powers through its staff within Ofgem, in Great Britain and the AUC in Alberta, Canada. 
 
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations generally requires each Registrant to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses, permits, inspections, audits and other approvals. Further, compliance with laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures, including expenditures for new equipment, inspection, cleanup costs, removal and remediation costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. Compliance activities pursuant to existing or new laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive or otherwise uneconomical. As a result, each Registrant could be required to shut down some facilities or materially alter its operations. Further, each Registrant may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental or other regulatory approvals and permits for its operating assets or development projects. Delays in, or active opposition by third parties to, obtaining any required environmental or regulatory authorizations or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorizations may increase costs or prevent or delay each Registrant from operating its facilities, developing or favorably locating new facilities or expanding existing facilities. If any Registrant fails to comply with any environmental or other regulatory requirements, such Registrant may be subject to penalties and fines or other sanctions, including changes to the way its electricity generating facilities are operated that may adversely impact generation or how the Pipeline Companies are permitted to operate their systems that may adversely impact throughput. The costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. Not being able to operate existing facilities or develop new generating facilities to meet customer electricity needs could require such Registrant to increase its purchases of electricity on the wholesale market, which could increase market and price risks and adversely affect such Registrant's financial results. 
 
 Existing laws and regulations, while comprehensive, are subject to changes and revisions from ongoing policy initiatives by legislators and regulators and to interpretations that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. For example, changes in laws and regulations could result in, but are not limited to, increased competition and decreased revenue within each Registrant's service territories; new environmental requirements, including the implementation of or changes to the Affordable Clean Energy rule, RPS and GHG emissions reduction goals; the issuance of new or stricter air quality standards; the implementation of energy efficiency mandates; the issuance of regulations governing the management and disposal of coal combustion byproducts; changes in forecasting requirements; changes to each Registrant's service territories as a result of condemnation or takeover by municipalities or other governmental entities, particularly where it lacks the exclusive right to serve its customers; the inability of each Registrant to recover its costs on a timely basis, if at all; new pipeline safety requirements; or a negative impact on each Registrant's current cost recovery arrangements. In addition to changes in existing legislation and regulation, new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted from time to time that impose additional or new requirements or standards on each Registrant. For example, in April 2022, the EPA proposed the "Cross-State Ozone Transport Rule", which contains requirements intended to address ozone transport between states through federally required nitrogen oxide reductions from fossil-fuel generating facilities. The rule included Wyoming, Utah and Nevada for the first time. If finalized as proposed, the rule will have impacts on PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in both Utah and Wyoming that do not have an SCR as early as 2026 and threatens early coal-fueled unit retirements and reliability impacts. PacifiCorp has engaged with state and federal agencies to make adjustments to the rule and mitigate potential reliability impacts. Adverse rulings in GHG-related cases could result in increased or changed regulations and could increase costs for GHG emitters, including the Registrants' generating facilities. The GHG rules, changes to those rules, and the Registrants' compliance requirements are subject to potential outcomes from proceedings and litigation challenging the rules. 
 
 69 

New federal, regional, state and international accords, legislation, regulation, or judicial proceedings limiting GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants, the U.S. and the global economy. Companies and industries with higher GHG emissions, such as utilities with significant coal-fueled generating facilities, will be subject to more direct impacts and greater financial and regulatory risks. The impact is dependent on numerous factors, none of which can be meaningfully quantified at this time. These factors include, but are not limited to, the magnitude and timing of GHG emissions reduction requirements; the design of the requirements; the cost, availability and effectiveness of emissions control technology; the price, distribution method and availability of offsets and allowances used for compliance; government-imposed compliance costs; and the existence and nature of incremental cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of how new requirements may impact the Registrants include: 
 
 Additional costs may be incurred to purchase required emissions allowances under any market-based cap-and-trade system in excess of allocations that are received at no cost. These purchases would be necessary until new technologies could be developed and deployed to reduce emissions or lower carbon generation is available; 
 Acquiring and renewing construction and operating permits for new and existing generating facilities may be costly and difficult; 
 Additional costs may be incurred to purchase and deploy new generating technologies; 
 Costs may be incurred to retire existing coal-fueled generating facilities before the end of their otherwise useful lives or to convert them to burn fuels, such as natural gas or biomass, that result in lower emissions; 
 Operating costs may be higher and generating unit outputs may be lower; 
 Higher interest and financing costs and reduced access to capital markets may result to the extent that financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a greater business risk; and 
 The relevant Registrant's natural gas pipeline operations and capacity sales, electric transmission and retail sales may be impacted in response to changes in customer demand and requirements to reduce GHG emissions. 
 
 The impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, whether from natural processes or human activities, are uncertain and could vary widely, from highly localized to worldwide, and the extent to which a utility's operations may be affected is uncertain. Climate change may cause physical and financial risks through, among other things, sea level rise, changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. Consumer demand for energy may increase or decrease, based on overall changes in weather and as customers promote lower energy consumption through the continued use of energy efficiency programs or other means. Availability of resources to generate electricity, such as water for hydroelectric production and cooling purposes, may also be impacted by climate change and could influence the Registrants' existing and future electricity generating portfolio. These issues may have a direct impact on the costs of electricity production and increase the price customers pay or their demand for electricity. 
 
 Implementing actions required under, and otherwise complying with, new federal and state laws and regulations and changes in existing ones are among the most challenging aspects of managing utility operations. The Registrants cannot accurately predict the type or scope of future laws and regulations that may be enacted, changes in existing ones or new interpretations by agency orders or court decisions, nor can each Registrant determine their impact on it at this time; however, any one of these could adversely affect each Registrant's financial results through higher capital expenditures and operating costs, early closure of generating facilities or lower tax benefits or restrict or otherwise cause an adverse change in how each Registrant operates its business. To the extent that each Registrant is not allowed by its regulators to recover or cannot otherwise recover the costs to comply with new laws and regulations or changes in existing ones, the costs of complying with such additional requirements could have a material adverse effect on the relevant Registrant's financial results. Additionally, even if such costs are recoverable in rates, if they are substantial and result in rates increasing to levels that substantially reduce customer demand, this could have a material adverse effect on the relevant Registrant's financial results. 
 
 Recovery of costs and certain activities by each Registrant is subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs or undertake certain activities may adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. 
 
 State Regulatory Rate Review Proceedings 
 
 The Utilities establish rates for their regulated retail service through state regulatory proceedings. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including government bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but generally have the common objective of limiting rate increases or requesting rate decreases while also requiring the Utilities to ensure system reliability. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, potentially leading to further uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. 
 70 

States set retail rates based in part upon the state regulatory commission's acceptance of an allocated share of total utility costs. When states adopt different methods to calculate interjurisdictional cost allocations, some costs may not be incorporated into rates of any state or other jurisdiction. Ratemaking is also generally done on the basis of estimates of normalized costs, so if a given year's realized costs are higher than normalized costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover those costs. In some cases, actual costs are lower than the normalized or estimated costs recovered through rates and from time-to-time may result in a state regulator requiring refunds to customers. Each state regulatory commission generally sets rates based on a test year established in accordance with that commission's policies. The test year data adopted by each state regulatory commission may create a lag between the incurrence of a cost and its recovery in rates. Each state regulatory commission also decides the allowed levels of expense, investment and capital structure that it deems are prudently incurred in providing the service and may disallow recovery in rates for any costs that it believes do not meet such standard. Additionally, each state regulatory commission establishes the allowed rate of return the Utilities will be given an opportunity to earn on their sources of capital. While rate regulation is premised on providing a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the state regulatory commissions do not guarantee that each Registrant will be able to realize the allowed rate of return or recover all of its costs even if it believes such costs to be prudently incurred. 
 
 Some state regulatory commissions have authorized recovery of certain costs above the level assumed in establishing base rates through adjustment mechanisms, which may be subject to customer sharing. Any significant increase in fuel costs for electricity generation or purchased electricity costs could have a negative impact on the Utilities, despite efforts to minimize this impact through the use of hedging contracts and adjustment mechanisms or through future general regulatory rate reviews. Any of these consequences could adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. 
 
 FERC Jurisdiction 
 
 The FERC authorizes cost-based rates associated with transmission services provided by the Utilities' transmission facilities. Under the Federal Power Act, the Utilities, or MISO as it relates to MidAmerican Energy, may voluntarily file, or may be obligated to file, for changes, including general rate changes, to their system-wide transmission service rates. General rate changes implemented may be subject to refund. The FERC also has responsibility for approving both cost- and market-based rates under which the Utilities sell electricity in the wholesale market, has jurisdiction over most of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities and has broad jurisdiction over energy markets. The FERC may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility of these markets or could revoke or restrict the ability of the Utilities to sell electricity at market-based rates, which could adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. The FERC also maintains rules concerning standards of conduct, affiliate restrictions, interlocking directorates and cross-subsidization. As a transmission owning member of MISO, MidAmerican Energy is also subject to MISO-directed modifications of market rules, which are subject to FERC approval and operational procedures. As participants in EIM, PacifiCorp, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific are also subject to applicable California ISO rules, which are subject to FERC approval and operational procedures. The FERC may also impose substantial civil penalties for any non-compliance with the Federal Power Act and the FERC's rules and orders. 
 
 The NERC has standards in place to ensure the reliability of the electric generation system and transmission grid. The Utilities are subject to the NERC's regulations and periodic audits to ensure compliance with those regulations. The NERC may carry out enforcement actions for non-compliance and administer significant financial penalties, subject to the FERC's review. 
 
 The FERC has jurisdiction over, among other things, the construction, abandonment, modification and operation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities used in the transportation, storage and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce, including all rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The FERC also has market transparency authority and has adopted additional reporting and internet posting requirements for natural gas pipelines and buyers and sellers of natural gas. 
 
 Rates for the interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations at the Pipeline Companies, which include reservation, commodity, surcharges, fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for charges, are authorized by the FERC. In accordance with the FERC's ratemaking principles, the Pipeline Companies' current maximum tariff rates are designed to recover prudently incurred costs included in their pipeline system's regulatory cost of service that are associated with the construction, operation and maintenance of their pipeline system and to afford the Pipeline Companies an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return. Nevertheless, the rates the FERC authorizes the Pipeline Companies to charge their customers may not be sufficient to recover the costs incurred to provide services in any given period. Moreover, from time to time, the FERC may change, alter or refine its policies or methodologies for establishing pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service. In addition, the FERC has the authority under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ("NGA") to investigate whether a pipeline may be earning more than its allowed rate of return and, when appropriate, to institute proceedings against such pipeline to prospectively reduce rates. Any such proceedings, if instituted, could result in significantly adverse rate decreases. 
 
 71 

Under FERC policy, interstate pipelines and their customers may execute contracts at negotiated rates, which may be above or below the maximum tariff rate for that service or the pipeline may agree to provide a discounted rate, which would be a rate between the maximum and minimum tariff rates. In a rate proceeding, rates in these contracts are generally not subject to adjustment. It is possible that the cost to perform services under negotiated or discounted rate contracts will exceed the cost used in the determination of the negotiated or discounted rates, which could result either in losses or lower rates of return for providing such services. Under certain circumstances, FERC policy allows interstate natural gas pipelines to design new maximum tariff rates to recover such costs in regulatory rate reviews. However, with respect to discounts granted to affiliates, the interstate natural gas pipeline must demonstrate that the discounted rate was necessary in order to meet competition. 
 
 GEMA Jurisdiction 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, as DNOs and holders of electricity distribution licenses, are subject to regulation by GEMA. Most of the revenue of a DNO is controlled by a distribution price control formula set out in the electricity distribution license. The price control formula does not directly constrain profits from year-to-year but is a control on revenue that operates independent of a significant portion of the DNO's actual costs. A resetting of the formula does not require the consent of the DNO, but if a licensee disagrees with a change to its license, it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's CMA. GEMA is able to impose financial penalties on DNOs that contravene any of their electricity distribution license duties or certain of their duties under British law or fail to achieve satisfactory performance of individual standards prescribed by GEMA. Any penalty imposed must be reasonable and may not exceed 10 of the DNO's revenue. During the term of any price control, additional costs have a direct impact on the financial results of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies. 
 
 AUC Jurisdiction 
 
 The AUC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency established by the province of Alberta, Canada, which is responsible for, among other things, approving the tariffs of transmission facility owners, including AltaLink, and distribution utilities, acquisitions of such transmission facility owners or utilities, and construction and operation of new transmission projects in Alberta. The AUC also investigates and rules on regulated rate disputes and system access problems. 
 
 The AUC regulates and oversees Alberta's electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink's activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. The AUC has various core functions in regulating the Alberta electricity transmission sector, including the following: 
 regulating and adjudicating issues related to the operation of electric utilities within Alberta; 
 processing and approving general tariff applications relating to revenue requirements, capital expenditure prudency and rates of return including deemed capital structure for regulated utilities while ensuring that utility rates are just and reasonable and approval of the transmission tariff rates of regulated transmission providers paid by the AESO, which is the independent transmission system operator in Alberta, Canada that controls the operation of AltaLink's transmission system; 
 approving the need for new electricity transmission facilities and permits to build and licenses to operate electricity transmission facilities; 
 reviewing operations and accounts from electric utilities and conducting on-site inspections to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards; 
 adjudicating enforcement issues including the imposition of administrative penalties that arise when market participants violate the rules of the AESO; and 
 collecting, storing, analyzing, appraising and disseminating information to effectively fulfill its duties as an industry regulator. 
 
 In addition, AUC approval is required in connection with new energy and regulated utility initiatives in Alberta, amendments to existing approvals and financing proposals by designated utilities.

Physical or cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact each Registrant's operations and could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 Each Registrant relies on technology in virtually all aspects of its business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of the Registrant's technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks and each Registrant expects to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of its technology systems by physical or cyber attack could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users, and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against each Registrant's systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose it to remediation costs and reputational damage. 
 
 Although the Registrants have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of each Registrant's operations could adversely affect the impacted Registrant's financial results. Cyber attacks could further adversely affect each Registrant's ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise sensitive customer and employee information. In addition, physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on each Registrant. Additionally, if each Registrant is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage. 
 
 Each Registrant is actively pursuing, developing and constructing new or expanded facilities, the completion and expected costs of which are subject to significant risk, and each Registrant has significant funding needs related to its planned capital expenditures. 
 
 Each Registrant actively pursues, develops and constructs new or expanded facilities. Each Registrant expects to incur significant annual capital expenditures over the next several years. Such expenditures may include construction and other costs for new electricity generating facilities, electric transmission or distribution projects, environmental control and compliance systems, natural gas storage facilities, new or expanded pipeline systems, and continued maintenance and upgrades of existing assets. 
 
 Development and construction of major facilities are subject to substantial risks, including fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, manufactured goods, equipment, and the imposition of tariffs thereon when sourced by foreign providers, labor, siting and permitting and changes in environmental and operational compliance matters, load forecasts and other items over a multi-year construction period, as well as counterparty risk and the economic viability of the Registrants' suppliers, customers and contractors. Certain of the Registrants' construction projects are substantially dependent upon a single supplier or contractor and replacement of such supplier or contractor may be difficult and cannot be assured. These risks may result in the inability to timely complete a project or higher than expected costs to complete an asset and place it in-service and, in extreme cases, the loss of the power purchase agreements or other long-term off-take contracts underlying such projects. Such costs may not be recoverable in the regulated rates or market or contract prices each Registrant is able to charge its customers. Delays in construction of renewable projects may result in delayed in-service dates which may result in the loss of anticipated revenue or income tax benefits. It is also possible that additional generation needs may be obtained through power purchase agreements, which could increase long-term purchase obligations and force reliance on the operating performance of a third party. The inability to successfully and timely complete a project, avoid unexpected costs or recover any such costs could adversely affect such Registrant's financial results. 
 
 Furthermore, each Registrant depends upon both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. If BHE does not provide needed funding to its subsidiaries and the subsidiaries are unable to obtain funding from external sources, they may need to postpone or cancel planned capital expenditures. 
 
 A significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity or natural gas in the markets served by each Registrant would decrease its operating revenue, could impact its planned capital expenditures and could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 A significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity or natural gas in the markets served by each Registrant would decrease its operating revenue, could impact its planned capital expenditures and could adversely affect its financial results. Factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include, among others: 
 a depression, recession or other adverse economic condition that results in a lower level of economic activity or reduced spending by consumers on electricity or natural gas; 
 an increase in the market price of electricity or natural gas or a decrease in the price of other competing forms of energy; 
 73 

shifts in competitively priced natural gas supply sources away from the sources connected to the Pipeline Companies' systems, including shale gas sources; 
 efforts by customers, legislators and regulators to reduce the consumption of electricity generated or distributed by each Registrant through various existing laws and regulations, as well as, deregulation, conservation, energy efficiency and private generation measures and programs; 
 laws mandating or encouraging renewable energy sources, which may decrease the demand for electricity and natural gas or change the market prices of these commodities; 
 higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of natural gas or other fuel sources for electricity generation or that limit the use of natural gas or the generation of electricity from fossil fuels; 
 a shift to more energy-efficient or alternative fuel machinery or an improvement in fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating higher fuel economy or lower emissions, price differentials, incentives or otherwise; 
 a reduction in the state or federal subsidies or tax incentives that are provided to agricultural, industrial or other customers, or a significant sustained change in prices for commodities such as ethanol or corn for ethanol manufacturers; and 
 sustained mild weather that reduces heating or cooling needs. 
 
 Each Registrant's operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and may be adversely affected by weather. 
 
 In most parts of the U.S. and other markets in which each Registrant operates, demand for electricity peaks during the summer months when irrigation and cooling needs are higher. Market prices for electricity also generally peak at that time. In other areas, including the western portion of PacifiCorp's service territory, demand for electricity peaks during the winter when heating needs are higher. In addition, demand for natural gas and other fuels generally peaks during the winter. This is especially true in MidAmerican Energy's and Sierra Pacific's retail natural gas businesses. Further, extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves, winter storms or floods could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. Periods of low rainfall or snowpack may negatively impact electricity generation at PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities, which may result in greater purchases of electricity from the wholesale market or from other sources at market prices. Additionally, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy have added substantial wind-powered generating capacity, and BHE's unregulated subsidiaries are adding solar-powered and wind-powered generating capacity, each of which is also a climate-dependent resource. 
 
 As a result, the overall financial results of each Registrant may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis. Each Registrant has historically provided less service, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are mild. Unusually mild weather in the future may adversely affect each Registrant's financial results through lower revenue or margins. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase each Registrant's costs to provide services and could adversely affect its financial results. The extent of fluctuation in each Registrant's financial results may change depending on a number of factors related to its regulatory environment and contractual agreements, including its ability to recover energy costs, the existence of revenue sharing provisions as it relates to MidAmerican Energy, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific, and terms of its wholesale sale contracts. 
 
 74 

Each Registrant is subject to market risk associated with the wholesale energy markets, which could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 In general, each Registrant's primary market risk is adverse fluctuations in the market price of wholesale electricity and fuel, including natural gas, coal and fuel oil, which is compounded by volumetric changes affecting the availability of or demand for electricity and fuel. The market price of wholesale electricity may be influenced by several factors, such as the adequacy or type of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission and distribution facilities, weather conditions, demand for electricity, economic growth and changes in technology. Volumetric changes are caused by fluctuations in generation or changes in customer needs that can be due to the weather, electricity and fuel prices, the economy, regulations or customer behavior. For example, the Utilities purchase electricity and fuel in the open market as part of their normal operating businesses. If market prices rise, especially in a time when larger than expected volumes must be purchased at market prices, the Utilities may incur significantly greater expenses than anticipated. Likewise, if electricity market prices decline in a period when the Utilities are a net seller of electricity in the wholesale market, the Utilities could earn less revenue. Although the Utilities have ECAMs, the risks associated with changes in market prices may not be fully mitigated due to customer sharing bands as it relates to PacifiCorp and other factors. 
 
 Potential terrorist activities and the impact of military or other actions, including sanctions, export controls and similar measures, could adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. 
 
 The ongoing threat of terrorism and the impact of military or other actions by nations or politically, ethnically or religiously motivated organizations regionally or globally may create increased political, economic, social and financial market instability, which could subject each Registrant's operations to increased risks. Additionally, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically pipeline, nuclear generation, transmission and other electric utility infrastructure, are potential targets for terrorist attacks. Further, the potential or actual outbreak of war or other hostilities, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the resulting economic sanctions on Russia and the sale of Russian natural gas and petroleum, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions and military actions, could adversely affect global and regional economies and financial markets. For instance, the current ban on imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal to the U.S. could contribute to increases in prices for such commodities in the U.S. and elsewhere which could adversely affect each Registrant's business. Further, each Registrant's business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant governmental authorities in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and European Union, which include sanctions that could potentially restrict or prohibit each Registrant's relationships with certain suppliers and customers. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with the operating assets of the Registrants, customers or suppliers, or continued increases in the price of natural gas and other petroleum commodities may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher costs, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect each Registrant in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect BHE's consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also materially adversely affect each Registrant's ability to raise capital. 
 
 75 

Certain Registrants are subject to the unique risks associated with nuclear generation. 
 
 The ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities, such as MidAmerican Energy's 25 ownership interest in Quad Cities Station, involves certain risks. These risks include, among other items, mechanical or structural problems, inadequacy or lapses in maintenance protocols, the impairment of reactor operation and safety systems due to human error, the costs of storage, handling and disposal of nuclear materials, compliance with and changes in regulation of nuclear generating facilities, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available, and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their useful lives. Additionally, Constellation Energy, the 75 owner and operator of the facility, may respond to the occurrence of any of these or other risks in a manner that negatively impacts MidAmerican Energy, including closure of Quad Cities Station prior to the expiration of its operating license. The prolonged unavailability, or early closure, of Quad Cities Station due to operational or economic factors could have a materially adverse effect on the relevant Registrant's financial results, particularly when the cost to produce power at the generating facility is significantly less than market wholesale prices. The following are among the more significant of these risks: 
 Operational Risk - Operations at any nuclear generating facility could degrade to the point where the generating facility would have to be shut down. If such degradations were to occur, the process of identifying and correcting the causes of the operational downgrade to return the generating facility to operation could require significant time and expenses, resulting in both lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased electricity costs to meet supply commitments. Rather than incurring substantial costs to restart the generating facility, the generating facility could be shut down. Furthermore, a shut-down or failure at any other nuclear generating facility could cause regulators to require a shut-down or reduced availability at Quad Cities Station. 
 In addition, issues relating to the disposal of nuclear waste material, including the availability, unavailability and expenses of a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel could adversely impact operations as well as the cost and ability to decommission nuclear generating facilities, including Quad Cities Station, in the future. 
 
 Regulatory Risk - The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with applicable Atomic Energy Act regulations or the terms of the licenses of nuclear facilities. Unless extended, the NRC operating licenses for Quad Cities Station will expire in 2032. Changes in regulations by the NRC could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or result in increased operating or decommissioning costs. 
 
 Nuclear Accident and Catastrophic Risks - Accidents and other unforeseen catastrophic events have occurred at nuclear facilities other than Quad Cities Station, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, such as at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear generating facility in Japan as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The consequences of an accident or catastrophic event can be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident or catastrophic event could exceed the relevant Registrant's resources, including insurance coverage. 
 
 Certain of BHE's subsidiaries are subject to the risk that customers will not renew their contracts or that BHE's subsidiaries will be unable to obtain new customers for expanded capacity, each of which could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 If BHE's subsidiaries are unable to renew, remarket, or find replacements for their customer agreements on favorable terms, BHE's subsidiaries' sales volumes and operating revenue would be exposed to reduction and increased volatility. For example, without the benefit of long-term transportation agreements, BHE cannot assure that the Pipeline Companies will be able to transport natural gas at efficient capacity levels. Substantially all of the Pipeline Companies' revenue is generated under transportation, storage and LNG contracts that periodically must be renegotiated and extended or replaced, and the Pipeline Companies are dependent upon relatively few customers for a substantial portion of their revenue. Similarly, without long-term power purchase agreements, BHE cannot assure that its unregulated power generators will be able to operate profitably. Failure to maintain existing long-term agreements or secure new long-term agreements, or being required to discount rates significantly upon renewal or replacement, could adversely affect BHE's consolidated financial results. The replacement of any existing long-term agreements depends on market conditions and other factors that may be beyond BHE's subsidiaries' control. 
 
 76 

Each Registrant is subject to counterparty risk, which could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 Each Registrant is subject to counterparty credit risk related to contractual payment obligations with wholesale suppliers and customers. Adverse economic conditions or other events affecting counterparties with whom each Registrant conducts business could impair the ability of these counterparties to meet their payment obligations. Each Registrant depends on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis. Each Registrant continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its wholesale suppliers and customers in an attempt to reduce the impact of any potential counterparty default. If strategies used to minimize these risk exposures are ineffective or if any Registrant's wholesale suppliers' or customers' financial condition deteriorates or they otherwise become unable to pay, it could have a significant adverse impact on each Registrant's liquidity and its financial results. 
 
 Each Registrant is subject to counterparty performance risk related to performance of contractual obligations by wholesale suppliers, customers and contractors. Each Registrant relies on wholesale suppliers to deliver commodities, primarily natural gas, coal and electricity, in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. Failure or delay by suppliers to provide these commodities pursuant to existing contracts could disrupt the delivery of electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet customer needs. In addition, when these contracts terminate, the Utilities may be unable to purchase the commodities on terms equivalent to the terms of current contracts. 
 
 Each Registrant relies on wholesale customers to take delivery of the energy they have committed to purchase. Failure of customers to take delivery may require the relevant Registrant to find other customers to take the energy at lower prices than the original customers committed to pay. If each Registrant's wholesale customers are unable to fulfill their obligations, there may be a significant adverse impact on its financial results. 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' customers are concentrated in a small number of electricity supply businesses with E.ON and British Gas Trading Limited accounting for approximately 22 and 14 , respectively, of distribution revenue in 2022. AltaLink's primary source of operating revenue is the AESO. Generally, a single customer purchases the energy from BHE's independent power projects in the U.S. pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. For example, certain of BHE Renewables' solar and wind independent power projects sell all of their electrical production to either PG E or SCE, respectively. Any material payment or other performance failure by the counterparties in these arrangements could have a significant adverse impact on BHE's consolidated financial results. 
 
 BHE owns investments in foreign countries that are exposed to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and increased economic, regulatory and political risks. 
 
 BHE's business operations and investments outside the U.S. increase its risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the British pound and the Canadian dollar. BHE's principal reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the value of the assets and liabilities, earnings, cash flows and potential distributions from its foreign operations changes with the fluctuations of the currency in which they transact. BHE may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by, among other things, requiring contracted amounts be settled in, or indexed to, U.S. dollars or a currency freely convertible into U.S. dollars, or hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and could negatively affect BHE's consolidated financial results. 
 
 In addition to any disruption in the global financial markets, the economic, regulatory and political conditions in some of the countries where BHE has operations or is pursuing investment opportunities may present increased risks related to, among others, inflation, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency repatriation restrictions, nationalization, renegotiation, privatization, availability of financing on suitable terms, customer creditworthiness, construction delays, business interruption, political instability, civil unrest, guerilla activity, terrorism, pandemics (including potentially in relation to COVID-19 variants), expropriation, trade sanctions, contract nullification and changes in law, regulations or tax policy. BHE may not choose to or be capable of either fully insuring against or effectively hedging these risks. 
 
 77 

Poor performance of plan and fund investments and other factors impacting the pension and other postretirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning and mine reclamation trust funds could unfavorably impact each Registrant's cash flows, liquidity and financial results. 
 
 Costs of providing each Registrant's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans and costs associated with the joint trustee plan to which PacifiCorp contributes depend upon a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of benefits provided, discount rates, mortality assumptions, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, the funded status of the plans, changes in benefit design, tax deductibility and funding limits, changes in laws and government regulation and each Registrant's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Furthermore, the timing of recognition of unrecognized gains and losses associated with the Registrants' defined benefit pension plans is subject to volatility due to events that may give rise to settlement accounting. Settlement events resulting from lump sum distributions offered by certain of the Registrants' defined benefit pension plans are influenced by the interest rates used to discount a participant's lump sum distribution. When the applicable interest rates are low, lump sum distributions in a given year tend to increase resulting in a higher likelihood of triggering settlement accounting. 
 
 If the Registrant's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are in underfunded positions, the respective Registrant may be required to make cash contributions to fund such underfunded plans in the future. Additionally, each Registrant's plans have investments in domestic and foreign equity and debt securities and other investments that are subject to loss. Losses from investments could add to the volatility, size and timing of future contributions. 
 
 Furthermore, the funded status of the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan multiemployer plan to which PacifiCorp's subsidiary previously contributed is considered critical and declining. PacifiCorp's subsidiary involuntarily withdrew from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan in June 2015 when the UMWA employees ceased performing work for the subsidiary. PacifiCorp has recorded its best estimate of the withdrawal obligation. 
 
 In addition, MidAmerican Energy is required to fund over time the projected costs of decommissioning Quad Cities Station, a nuclear generating facility, and Bridger Coal Company, a joint venture of PacifiCorp's subsidiary, Pacific Minerals, Inc., is required to fund projected mine reclamation costs. The funds that MidAmerican Energy has invested in a nuclear decommissioning trust and a subsidiary of PacifiCorp has invested in a mine reclamation trust are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments will reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require MidAmerican Energy or PacifiCorp's subsidiary to make additional cash contributions. As contributions to the trust are being made over the operating life of the respective facility, reductions in the expected operating life of the facility could also require MidAmerican Energy and PacifiCorp's subsidiary to make additional contributions to the related trust. Such cash funding obligations, which are also impacted by the other factors described above, could have a material impact on MidAmerican Energy's or PacifiCorp's liquidity by reducing their available cash. 
 
 Inflation and changes in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may adversely affect each Registrant's financial results. 
 
 Inflation and increases in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may affect each Registrant by increasing both operating and capital costs. As a result of existing rate agreements, contractual arrangements or competitive price pressures, each Registrant may not be able to pass the costs of inflation on to its customers. If each Registrant is unable to manage cost increases or pass them on to its customers, its financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Cyclical fluctuations and competition in the residential real estate brokerage and mortgage businesses could adversely affect HomeServices. 
 
 The residential real estate brokerage and mortgage industries tend to experience cycles of greater and lesser activity and profitability and are typically affected by changes in economic conditions, which are beyond HomeServices' control. Any of the following, among others, are examples of items that could have a material adverse effect on HomeServices' businesses by causing a general decline in the number of home sales, sale prices or the number of home financings which, in turn, would adversely affect its financial results: 
 rising interest rates or unemployment rates, including a sustained high unemployment rate in the U.S.; 
 periods of economic slowdown or recession in the markets served or the adverse effects on market actions as a result of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks; 
 decreasing home affordability; 
 78 

lack of available mortgage credit for potential homebuyers, such as the reduced availability of credit, which may continue into future periods; 
 inadequate home inventory levels; 
 sources of new competition; and 
 changes in applicable tax law. 
 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect each Registrant's ability to obtain debt financing or to draw upon or renew existing credit facilities and have other adverse effects on each Registrant. 
 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect each Registrant's ability to obtain debt financing or to draw upon or renew existing credit facilities and have other adverse effects on each Registrant. Significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the U.S., Great Britain, Canada and global credit markets, such as those that occurred in 2008, 2009 and 2020, may materially impact liquidity in the bank and debt capital markets, making financing terms less attractive for borrowers that are able to find financing and, in other cases, may cause certain types of debt financing, or any financing, to be unavailable. Additionally, economic uncertainty in the U.S. or globally may adversely affect the U.S. credit markets and could negatively impact each Registrant's ability to access funds on favorable terms or at all. If a Registrant is unable to access the bank and debt markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure needs, it may adversely affect the timing and amount of its capital expenditures, acquisition financing and its financial results. 
 
 Each Registrant is involved in a variety of legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could adversely affect its financial results. 
 
 Each Registrant is, and in the future may become, a party to a variety of legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with certainty. It is possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which each Registrant is involved could result in additional material payments substantially in excess of established liabilities or in terms that could require each Registrant to change business practices and procedures or divest ownership of assets. Further, litigation could result in the imposition of financial penalties or injunctions and adverse regulatory consequences, any of which could limit each Registrant's ability to take certain desired actions or the denial of needed permits, licenses or regulatory authority to conduct its business, including the siting or permitting of facilities. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on such Registrant's financial results. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 2. Properties 
 
 Each Registrant's energy properties consist of the physical assets necessary to support its electricity and natural gas businesses. Properties of the relevant Registrant's electricity businesses include electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as coal mining assets that support certain of PacifiCorp's electric generating facilities. Properties of the relevant Registrant's natural gas businesses include natural gas distribution facilities, interstate pipelines, storage facilities, LNG facilities, compressor stations and meter stations. The transmission and distribution assets are primarily within each Registrant's service territories. In addition to these physical assets, the Registrants have rights-of-way, mineral rights and water rights that enable each Registrant to utilize its facilities. It is the opinion of each Registrant's management that the principal depreciable properties owned by it are in good operating condition and are well maintained. Pursuant to separate financing agreements, substantially all of PacifiCorp's electric utility properties, MidAmerican Energy's electric utility properties in the state of Iowa, Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's properties in the state of Nevada, AltaLink's transmission properties and substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries of BHE Renewables that are direct or indirect owners of generation projects are pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise provide the security for the related subsidiary debt. For additional information regarding each Registrant's energy properties, refer to Item 1 of this Form 10-K and Notes 4, 5 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Financial Statements of MidAmerican Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Nevada Power in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Sierra Pacific in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Eastern Energy Gas in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The following table summarizes Berkshire Hathaway Energy's operating electric generating facilities as of December 31, 2022: 
 Facility Net Net Owned Energy Capacity Capacity Source Entity Location by Significance (MWs) (MWs) Wind PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, BHE Canada, BHE Montana and BHE Renewables Iowa, Wyoming, Texas, Montana, Nebraska, Washington, California, Illinois, Canada, Oregon and Kansas 12,282 12,282 Natural gas PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, NV Energy, BHE Canada and BHE Renewables Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Illinois, Washington, Wyoming, Oregon, Texas, New York, Arizona and Canada 11,284 11,005 Coal PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy and NV Energy Wyoming, Iowa, Utah, Nevada, Colorado and Montana 13,210 8,178 Solar MidAmerican Energy, NV Energy, Northern Powergrid and BHE Renewables California, Australia, Texas, Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada 2,120 1,972 Hydroelectric PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy and BHE Renewables Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Hawaii, Montana, Illinois, California and Wyoming 985 985 Nuclear MidAmerican Energy Illinois 1,822 455 Geothermal PacifiCorp and BHE Renewables California and Utah 377 377 Total 42,080 35,254 
 
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has electric generating facilities that are under construction in Nevada and Wyoming having total Facility Net Capacity and Net Owned Capacity of 243 MWs. 
 
 The right to construct and operate each Registrant's electric transmission and distribution facilities and interstate natural gas pipelines across certain property was obtained in most circumstances through negotiations and, where necessary, through prescription, eminent domain or similar rights. PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific, BHE GT S, Northern Natural Gas and Kern River in the U.S.; Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc in Great Britain; and AltaLink in Alberta, Canada continue to have the power of eminent domain or similar rights in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate their respective facilities, but the U.S. and Canadian utilities do not have the power of eminent domain with respect to governmental, Native American or Canadian First Nations' tribal lands. Although the main Kern River pipeline crosses the Moapa Indian Reservation, all facilities in the Moapa Indian Reservation are located within a utility corridor that is reserved to the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management. 
 
 With respect to real property, each of the electric transmission and distribution facilities and interstate natural gas pipelines fall into two basic categories: (1) parcels that are owned in fee, such as certain of the electric generating facilities, electric substations, natural gas compressor stations, natural gas meter stations and office sites; and (2) parcels where the interest derives from leases, easements (including prescriptive easements), rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for the construction, operation and maintenance of the electric transmission and distribution facilities and interstate natural gas pipelines. Each Registrant believes it has satisfactory title or interest to all of the real property making up their respective facilities in all material respects.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Berkshire Hathaway Energy and PacifiCorp 
 
 On September 30, 2020, a putative class action complaint against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al. , Case No. 20CV33885, Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon. The complaint was filed by Oregon residents and businesses who seek to represent a class of all Oregon citizens and entities whose real or personal property was harmed beginning on September 7, 2020, by wildfires in Oregon allegedly caused by PacifiCorp. On November 3, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to limit the class to include Oregon citizens allegedly impacted by the Echo Mountain Complex, South Obenchain, Two Four Two and Santiam Canyon fires, as well as to add claims for noneconomic damages. The amended complaint alleges that PacifiCorp's assets contributed to the Oregon wildfires occurring on or after September 7, 2020 and that PacifiCorp acted with gross negligence, among other things. The amended complaint seeks the following damages for the plaintiffs and the putative class: (i) noneconomic damages, including mental suffering, emotional distress, inconvenience and interference with normal and usual activities, in excess of 1 billion; (ii) damages for real and personal property and other economic losses of not less than 600 million; (iii) double the amount of property and economic damages; (iv) treble damages for specific costs associated with loss of timber, trees and shrubbery; (v) double the damages for the costs of litigation and reforestation; (vi) prejudgment interest; and (vii) reasonable attorney fees, investigation costs and expert witness fees. The plaintiffs demand a trial by jury and have reserved their right to further amend the complaint to allege claims for punitive damages. In May 2022, the Multnomah Circuit Court granted issue class certification and consolidated this case with others as described below. PacifiCorp requested an immediate appeal of the issue class certification before the Oregon Court of Appeals. In January 2023, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp's request for appeal. In February 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the complaint to add punitive damages in an unspecified amount. 
 
 On August 20, 2021, a complaint against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Shylo Salter et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 21CV33595, Multnomah County, Oregon, in which two complaints, Case No. 21CV09339 and Case No. 21CV09520, previously filed in Circuit Court, Marion County, Oregon, were combined. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the previously filed complaints in Marion County, Oregon. The refiled complaint was filed by Oregon residents and businesses who allege that they were injured by the Beachie Creek fire, which the plaintiffs allege began on or around September 7, 2020, but which government reports indicate began on or around August 16, 2020. The complaint alleges that PacifiCorp's assets contributed to the Beachie Creek fire and that PacifiCorp acted with gross negligence, among other things. The complaint seeks the following damages: (i) damages related to real and personal property in an amount determined by the jury to be fair and reasonable, estimated not to exceed 75 million; (ii) other economic losses in an amount determined by the jury to be fair and reasonable, but not to exceed 75 million; (iii) noneconomic damages in the amount determined by the jury to be fair and reasonable, but not to exceed 500 million; (iv) double the damages for economic and property damages under specified Oregon statutes; (v) alternatively, treble the damages under specified Oregon statutes; (vi) attorneys' fees and other costs; and (vii) pre- and post-judgment interest. The plaintiffs demand a trial by jury and have reserved their right to amend the complaint with an intent to add a claim for punitive damages. In May 2022, this case was consolidated with others as described below. 
 
 In May 2022, the Multnomah County Circuit Court granted plaintiffs' motion to consolidate Shylo Salter et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 21CV33595 (described above) and Amy Allen, et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 20CV37430 ("Allen") into Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al. , Case No. 20CV33885 (described above). Plaintiffs' motion to bifurcate issues for trial between class-wide liability and individual damages was also granted. The Allen case was filed by five individuals as amended in September 2021 claiming in excess of 32 million in economic and noneconomic damages, as well as claims for statutory doubling or trebling of damages, attorneys' fees and other costs and pre- and post-judgment interest. 
 
 In June 2022, an amended complaint against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Tim Goforth et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 20CV37637, Douglas County, Oregon, in which a previously filed complaint associated with the Archie Creek, Susan Creek and Smith Springs Road fires in Douglas County in September 2020 was amended to add punitive damages. The complaint alleges (i) PacifiCorp's conduct not only constituted common law negligence but gross negligence and contributed to or was the cause of ignition and spread of the aforementioned fires; (ii) PacifiCorp violated certain Oregon rules and regulations; and (iii) as an alternative to negligence, inverse condemnation. The complaint seeks the following damages: (i) economic and property damages of 11 million under a determination of negligence or inverse condemnation and subject to doubling under Oregon statute if applicable; (ii) doubling of those economic and property damages to 22 million under a determination of gross negligence; (iii) damages for injuries in excess of 47 million; (iv) punitive damages not to exceed 10 times the amount of non-economic damages awarded; (v) all costs of the lawsuit; (vi) pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and (vii) attorneys' fees and other costs. Pursuant to a settlement stipulation agreed to in November 2022, the Douglas County Circuit Court issued an order dismissing the case with prejudice and without costs, disbursements or attorney fees to any of the parties.

On August 26, 2022, a putative class action complaint seeking declaratory and equitable relief against PacifiCorp was filed, captioned Margaret Dietrich et al. v. PacifiCorp , Case No. 22CV29187, Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon. The complaint was filed by two Oregon residents individually and on behalf of a class initially defined to include residents of, business owners in, real or personal property owners in and any other individuals physically present in specified Oregon counties as of September 7, 2020 who experienced any harm, damage or loss as a result of the Santiam, Beachie Creek, Lionshead, Echo Mountain Complex, Two Four Two or South Obenchain fires in September 2020. The complaint was amended on September 6, 2022, to seek damages of over 900 million that were originally demanded on August 4, 2022, pursuant to Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure 32 H. The amended complaint alleges: (i) negligence due to alleged failure to comply with certain Oregon statutes and administrative rules; (ii) gross negligence due to alleged conscious indifference to or reckless disregard for the probable consequences of defendant's actions or inactions; (iii) private nuisance; (iv) public nuisance; (v) trespass; (vi) inverse condemnation; (vii) accounting/injunction; (viii) negligent infliction of emotional distress. The amended complaint seeks the following: (i) an order certifying the matter as a class action; (ii) economic damages not less than 400 million; (iii) double the amount of economic and property damages to the extent applicable under Oregon statute; (iv) reasonable costs of reforestation activities; (v) doubling and trebling of certain other damages to the extent applicable under certain Oregon statutes; (vi) noneconomic damages not less than 500 million; (vii) prejudgment interest; (viii) an order requiring an accounting with respect to the amount of damages; (ix) an order enjoining PacifiCorp from leaving power lines energized in areas of Oregon experiencing extremely critical fire conditions; (x) an award of reasonable attorney fees, costs, investigation costs, disbursements and expert witness fees; and (xi) other relief the court finds appropriate. The plaintiffs and proposed class demand a trial by jury. On December 19, 2022, the Dietrich case was consolidated into Jeanyne James et al. v.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of 2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of 122 million and letters of credit outstanding of 88 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was 1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was 61 million and outstanding letters of credit was 43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 The Company has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Note 9, 10 and 11), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 6), firm commitments (refer to Note 16), letters of credit (refer to Note 9), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 The Company has cash requirements relating to interest payments of 35.1 billion on long-term debt, including 2.2 billion due in 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 The Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 

Quad Cities Generating Station Operating Status 
 
 Constellation Energy Generation, LLC ("Constellation Energy"), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 ("Quad Cities Station") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25 ownership interest, receives financial support for continued operation of Quad Cities Station from the zero emission standard enacted by the Illinois legislature in December 2016. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs provide Constellation Energy additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy does not receive additional revenue from the subsidy. 
 
 101 

The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. ("PJM") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule ("MOPR"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program like the Illinois zero emission standard, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fueled resources. 
 
 On December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expanded the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which became effective as of the PJM's capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year. While the FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC denied rehearing of that order on April 16, 2020. A number of parties, including Constellation Energy, have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. MidAmerican Energy cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 
 While this litigation is pending, the MOPR applied to Quad Cities Station in the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year in May 2021, which prevented Quad Cities Station from clearing in that capacity auction. 
 
 At the direction of the PJM Board of Managers, the PJM and its stakeholders developed further MOPR reforms to ensure that the capacity market rules respect and accommodate state resource preferences such as the ZEC programs. The PJM filed related tariff revisions with the FERC on July 30, 2021, and, on September 29, 2021, the PJM's proposed MOPR reforms became effective by operation of law. Under the new tariff provisions, the MOPR applied in the capacity auction for the 2023-2024 delivery year but did not restrict the offers of Quad Cities Station, which cleared in the capacity auction. Requests for rehearing of the FERC's notice establishing the effective date for the PJM's proposed market reforms were filed in October 2021 and denied by operation of law on November 4, 2021. Several parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 
 Assuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard, Constellation Energy no longer considers Quad Cities Station to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois zero emission standard does not operate as expected over its full term, Quad Cities Station would be at heightened risk for early retirement. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources like Quad Cities Station other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement ("FRR") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings related to the PJM MOPR, the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard may be undermined unless the PJM adopts further changes to the MOPR or Illinois implements an FRR mechanism, under which Quad Cities Station would be removed from the PJM's capacity auction. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and the Company is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. 
 
 102 

BHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities. 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance," or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2022, the Company would have been required to post 704 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors. 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the U.S. and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate-setting structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate-setting structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 The Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 
 103 

The Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 5.1 billion and total regulatory liabilities were 7.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of 11.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31, 2022. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2022. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. 
 
 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a majority of all property, plant and equipment is used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. 
 
 The estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of an asset, for the purposes of impairment analysis, requires the exercise of judgment. Circumstances that could significantly alter the calculation of fair value or the recoverable amount of an asset may include significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset, the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 Certain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a net asset totaling 206 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2022, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled 376 million and in AOCI totaled 527 million. 
 
 The expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the key assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 104 

The Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced. 
 
 In establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 
 
 The Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00 by 2028, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant. 
 
 The key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (dollars in millions): 
 Domestic Plans Other Postretirement United Kingdom Pension Plans Benefit Plans Pension Plan +0.5 -0.5 +0.5 -0.5 +0.5 -0.5 Effect on December 31, 2022 Benefit Obligations: Discount rate (76) 82 (21) 23 (75) 86 Effect on 2022 Periodic Cost: Discount rate 5 (3) 1 (1) (4) 4 Expected rate of return on plan assets (13) 13 (4) 4 (7) 7 
 
 A variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes. 
 
 It is probable the Company's regulated businesses will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 2.5 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 
 
 105 

The Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the U.S. but the tax is not expected to be material. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue 
 
 Revenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was 828 million as of December 31, 2022. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings. 
 
 Wildfire Loss Contingencies 
 
 As a result of several wildfires that have occurred in the Company's service territory and surrounding areas in Oregon and California, the Company is required to evaluate its exposure to potential loss contingencies arising from claims associated with the wildfires. In determining this exposure, the Company is required to assess whether the likelihood of loss for each of the wildfires and lawsuits is remote, reasonably possible or probable, which involves complex judgments based on several variables including available information regarding the cause and origin of the wildfires, investigations, discovery associated with lawsuits and negotiations with various parties. If deemed reasonably possible, the Company is required to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss and disclose any material amounts. If deemed probable, the Company is required to accrue a loss if reasonably estimable based on the bottom end of the range if no amount within the range of estimated loss is any better than another amount. Many assumptions and variables are involved in determining these estimates, including identifying the various categories of potential loss such as fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages. Within the categories of potential loss, further assumptions are made regarding items such as the types of structures damaged, estimated replacement values associated with those structures, value of personal property, the types of natural resource damage such as timber, the value of that timber, the nature of noneconomic damages such as those arising from personal injuries, other damages the Company may be responsible for if found negligent such as punitive damages, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's loss contingencies associated with the 2020 Wildfires and the 2022 McKinney fire. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. The Company's significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which the Company transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with the Company's business activities. Each of the Company's business platforms has established guidelines for credit risk management. 
 
 106 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 The Company is principally exposed to electricity, natural gas, coal and fuel oil commodity price risk primarily through BHE's ownership of the Utilities as they have an obligation to serve retail customer load in their regulated service territories. The Company also provides nonregulated retail electricity and natural gas services in competitive markets. The Utilities' load and generating facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposures to commodity prices consist mainly of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for retail customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. The Company does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. To manage a portion of its commodity price risk, the Company uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The Company does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. The Company's exposure to commodity price risk is generally limited by its ability to include commodity costs in regulated rates, which is subject to regulatory lag that occurs between the time the costs are incurred and when the costs are included in regulated rates, as well as the impact of any customer sharing resulting from cost adjustment mechanisms. 
 
 The table that follows summarizes the Company's price risk on commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives, excluding collateral netting of (88) million and 26 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10 increase and 10 decrease in forward market prices with the contracted or expected volumes. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios (dollars in millions). 
 Fair Value - Estimated Fair Value after Net Asset Hypothetical Change in Price (Liability) 10 increase 10 decrease As of December 31, 2022: Not designated as hedging contracts 335 520 150 Designated as hedging contracts 12 40 (16) Total commodity derivative contracts 347 560 134 As of December 31, 2021: Not designated as hedging contracts 20 116 (76) Designated as hedging contracts (10) (5) (15) Total commodity derivative contracts 10 111 (91) 
 
 The settled cost of certain of the Company's commodity derivative contracts not designated as hedging contracts is included in regulated rates and, therefore, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on commodity derivative contracts do not expose the Company to earnings volatility. Consolidated financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, wholesale natural gas or fuel are higher than what is included in regulated rates, including the impacts of adjustment mechanisms. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a net regulatory liability of 231 million and a net regulatory asset of 71 million, respectively, was recorded related to the net derivative asset of 335 million and 20 million, respectively. For the Company's commodity derivative contracts designated as hedging contracts, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on commodity derivative contracts, to the extent the hedge is considered effective, generally do not expose the Company to earnings volatility. 
 
 107 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt, future debt issuances and mortgage commitments. The Company manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, the Company's fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose the Company to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. The nature and amount of the Company's short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Notes 9, 10, 11, and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Company's short and long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had short- and long-term variable-rate obligations totaling 3.2 billion and 3.7 billion, respectively, that expose the Company to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 The Company may from time to time enter into interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps or locks, forward sale commitments or mortgage interest rate lock commitments, to mitigate the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of agreements designated as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCI to the extent the hedge is effective until the forecasted transaction occurs. Changes in fair value of agreements not designated as hedging contracts are recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 481 million and 533 million, respectively, and 272 million and 174 million, respectively, to protect the Company against an increase in interest rates. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had mortgage commitments, net, with notional amounts of 438 million and 1,512 million, respectively, to protect the Company against an increase in interest rates. The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivative contracts was a net derivative asset of 108 million and 16 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A hypothetical 10 basis point increase and a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Company. 
 
 The Company holds foreign currency swaps with the purpose of hedging the foreign currency exchange rate associated with Euro denominated debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 250 million in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency swaps outstanding. A hypothetical 10 decrease in market interest rates would not have resulted in a material decrease in fair value of the Company's foreign currency swaps as of December 31. 
 
 Equity Price Risk 
 
 Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. 
 
 108 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited common stock represented approximately 86 and 92 , respectively, of the total fair value of the Company's equity securities. The majority of the Company's remaining equity securities are held in a trust related to the decommissioning of nuclear generation assets and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a net regulatory liability since the Company expects to recover costs for these activities through regulated rates. The following table summarizes the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the effects of a hypothetical 30 increase and a 30 decrease in market price as of those dates. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios (dollars in millions). 
 Estimated Hypothetical Hypothetical Fair Value after Percentage Increase Fair Price Hypothetical (Decrease) in BHE Value Change Change in Prices Shareholders' Equity As of December 31, 2022 3,763 30 increase 4,892 1 30 decrease 2,634 (1) As of December 31, 2021 7,693 30 increase 10,001 3 30 decrease 5,385 (3) 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 BHE's business operations and investments outside of the U.S. increase its risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in relation to the British pound and the Canadian dollar. BHE's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the value of the assets and liabilities, earnings, cash flows and potential distributions from BHE's foreign operations changes with the fluctuations of the currency in which they transact. 
 
 Northern Powergrid's functional currency is the British pound. As of December 31, 2022, a 10 devaluation in the British pound to the U.S. dollar would result in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet being negatively impacted by a 491 million cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI. A 10 devaluation in the average currency exchange rate would have resulted in lower reported earnings for Northern Powergrid of 39 million in 2022. 
 
 BHE Canada's functional currency is the Canadian dollar. As of December 31, 2022, a 10 devaluation in the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar would result in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet being negatively impacted by a 387 million cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI. A 10 devaluation in the average currency exchange rate would have resulted in lower reported earnings for BHE Canada of 18 million in 2022. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Domestic Regulated Operations 
 
 The Utilities are exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent the Utilities' counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, the Utilities analyze the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establish limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluate the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, the Utilities enter into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtain third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, the Utilities exercise rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp's aggregate credit exposure with wholesale energy supply and marketing counterparties included counterparties having non-investment grade, internally rated credit ratings. Substantially all of these non-investment grade, internally rated counterparties are associated with long-duration solar and wind power purchase agreements, some of which are from facilities that have not yet achieved commercial operation and for which PacifiCorp has no obligation should the facilities not achieve commercial operation. 
 
 109 

Substantially all of MidAmerican Energy's electric wholesale sales revenue results from participation in RTOs, including the MISO and the PJM. MidAmerican Energy's share of historical losses from defaults by other RTO market participants has not been material. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy's aggregate direct credit exposure from electric wholesale marketing counterparties was not material. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, NV Energy's aggregate credit exposure from energy related transactions, based on settlement and mark-to-market exposures, net of collateral, was not material. 
 
 BHE GT S primary customers include electric and natural gas distribution utilities and LNG export, import and storage customers. Northern Natural Gas' primary customers include utilities in the upper Midwest. Kern River's primary customers are electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies and financial institutions. As a general policy, collateral is not required for receivables from creditworthy customers. Customers' financial condition and creditworthiness, as defined by the tariff, are regularly evaluated and historical losses have been minimal. In order to provide protection against credit risk, and as permitted by the separate terms of each of BHE GT S, Northern Natural Gas' and Kern River's tariffs, the companies have required customers that lack creditworthiness to provide cash deposits, letters of credit or other security until they meet the creditworthiness requirements of the respective tariff. 
 
 Northern Powergrid 
 
 The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies charge fees for the use of their distribution systems to supply companies. The supply companies purchase electricity from generators and traders, sell the electricity to end-use customers and use the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution networks pursuant to the multilateral "Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement." The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' customers are concentrated in a small number of electricity supply businesses. During 2022, E.ON and certain of its affiliates and British Gas Trading Limited represented approximately 22 and 14 , respectively, of the total combined distribution revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies. The industry operates in accordance with a framework which sets credit limits for each supply business based on its credit rating or payment history and requires them to provide credit cover if their value at risk (measured as being equivalent to 45 days usage) exceeds the credit limit. Acceptable credit typically is provided in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit or an escrow account. Ofgem has indicated that, provided the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies have implemented credit control, billing and collection in line with best practice guidelines and can demonstrate compliance with the guidelines or are able to satisfactorily explain departure from the guidelines, any bad debt losses arising from supplier default will be recovered through an increase in future allowed income. Losses incurred to date have not been material. 
 
 BHE Canada 
 
 AltaLink's primary source of operating revenue is the AESO, an entity rated AA- by Standard and Poor's. Because of the dependence on a single customer, any material failure of the customer to fulfill its obligations would significantly impair AltaLink's ability to meet its existing and future obligations. Total operating revenue for AltaLink was 681 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 BHE Renewables 
 
 BHE Renewables owns independent power projects that generally have separate project financing agreements. These projects source of operating revenue is derived primarily from long-term power purchase agreements with single customers, primarily utilities, which expire between 2023 and 2043. Because of the dependence generally from a single customer at each project, any material failure of the customer to fulfill its obligations would significantly impair that project's ability to meet its existing and future obligations. Total operating revenue for BHE Renewables was 994 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of 
 Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company 
 Des Moines, Iowa 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as certain other regulatory commissions (collectively, the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric and natural gas rates of the Company's regulated businesses in the respective service territories where the Company operates. Management has determined its regulated operations meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 112 

Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow the Company an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit the Company's ability to recover their costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and (3) refunds to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the future outcome of decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. 
 
 Wildfires Contingencies See Note 16 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 As a result of several wildfires that have occurred in the Company's service territory and surrounding areas in Oregon and California, the Company is required to evaluate its exposure to potential loss contingencies arising from claims associated with the 2020 Wildfires and the 2022 McKinney Fire (the "Wildfires"). In determining this exposure, the Company is required to determine whether the likelihood of loss for each of the Wildfires is remote, reasonably possible or probable, which involves complex judgments based on several variables including available information regarding the cause and origin of the Wildfires, investigations, discovery associated with lawsuits and negotiations with claimants. 
 
 A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If deemed reasonably possible, the Company is required to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss and disclose any material amounts. 
 
 Management has recorded estimated liabilities of 424 million and receivables of 246 million, which represent its best estimate of probable losses and expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized probable losses, net of expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires of 64 million, million and 136 million, respectively. Management has disclosed reasonably possible estimated losses of 31 million, net of potential insurance recoveries of 103 million, associated with the 2022 McKinney Fire. 
 
 113 

We identified wildfire-related contingencies and the related disclosures as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to determine the probability of loss and estimate the probable or reasonably possible losses and insurance recoveries. This required the application of a high degree of judgment and extensive effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's judgments, estimates and disclosures related to wildfire-related loss contingencies. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to management's judgments regarding the probability of loss, estimated losses and insurance recoveries, and related disclosures for wildfire-related contingencies included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated management's judgments related to whether a loss was probable or reasonably possible for the Wildfires by inquiring of management and the Company's external and internal legal counsel regarding the likelihood and amounts of probable and reasonably possible losses, including the potential impact of information gained through investigations into the cause of the fires, information from claimants, the advice of legal counsel, and reading external information for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions. 
 We evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable and reasonably possible losses through inquiries with management and external and internal legal counsel and we tested the significant assumptions used in the estimates of probable and reasonably possible losses. 
 We read legal letters from the Company's external and internal legal counsel regarding known information and evaluated whether the information therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures. 
 We evaluated management's judgments related to whether related insurance recoveries were probable of collection by inquiring of management and the Company's external and internal legal counsel regarding the amounts of insurance recoveries recorded or disclosed. With the assistance of our insurance specialists, we tested the significant assumptions used in the determination of collectability, including obtaining and reading related policies to determine whether the types of insurance claims are included or excluded from coverage. 
 We evaluated whether the Company's disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.

 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which the Company transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, the Company uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent the Company's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. The Company bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by the Company. Market price quotations are generally readily obtainable for the applicable term of the Company's outstanding derivative contracts; therefore, the Company's forward price curves reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to the length of the contract. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, the Company uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts. 
 
 The Company's mortgage loans held for sale are valued based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices of other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. As necessary, these prices are adjusted for typical securitization activities, including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity.

 The Company's long-term debt is carried at cost, including fair value adjustments and unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs as applicable, on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks. The carrying value of the Company's variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value because of the frequent repricing of these instruments at market rates.

million plus million in California bond funds; (2) complete indemnification from harms associated with dam removal; (3) transfer of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") license to a third-party dam removal entity, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation ("KRRC"), who would conduct dam removal; and (4) ability for PacifiCorp to operate the facilities for the benefit of customers until dam removal commences. 
 
 In September 2016, the KRRC and PacifiCorp filed a joint application with the FERC to transfer the license for the four mainstem Klamath hydroelectric dams comprising the Lower Klamath Project (FERC Project No. 14803) from PacifiCorp to the KRRC. The FERC approved the partial transfer of the Klamath license in a July 2020 order, subject to the condition that PacifiCorp remains co-licensee. Under the amended KHSA, PacifiCorp did not agree to remain co-licensee during the surrender and removal process given concerns about liability protections for PacifiCorp and its customers. In November 2020, PacifiCorp entered a memorandum of agreement (the "MOA") with the KRRC, the Karuk Tribe, the Yurok Tribe and the States to continue implementation of the KHSA. The agreement required the States, PacifiCorp and KRRC to file a new license transfer application to remove PacifiCorp from the license for the Lower Klamath Project and add the States and KRRC as co-licensees for the purposes of surrender. In addition, the MOA provides for additional contingency funding of million, equally split between PacifiCorp and the States, and for PacifiCorp and the States to equally share in any additional cost overruns in the unlikely event that dam removal costs exceed the million in funding to ensure dam removal is complete. The MOA also requires PacifiCorp to cover the costs associated with certain pre-existing environmental conditions. In June 2021, the FERC approved the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams from PacifiCorp to the KRRC and the States as co-licensees. In July 2021, the Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho and California state public utility commissions conditionally approved the required property transfer applications. In August 2021, PacifiCorp notified the Public Service Commission of Utah of the property transfer, however no formal approval is required in Utah. In August 2022, the FERC staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the project, concluding that dam removal is the preferred action. In November 2022, the FERC issued a license surrender order for the project, which was accepted by the KRRC and the States in December 2022, along with the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams. Although PacifiCorp no longer owns the Lower Klamath Project, PacifiCorp will continue to operate the facilities under an operation and maintenance agreement with the KRRC until each facility is ready for removal. Removal of the Copco No. 2 facility is anticipated to begin in 2023, and removal of the remaining three dams (J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1, and Iron Gate) is anticipated to begin in 2024. 
 
 Hydroelectric Commitments 
 
 Certain of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric licenses and settlement agreements contain requirements for PacifiCorp to make certain capital and operating expenditures related to its hydroelectric facilities, which are estimated to be approximately million over the next years. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 The Company is party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. The Company does not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. The Company is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines, penalties and other costs in substantial amounts and are described below. 
 
 Wildfires Overview - PacifiCorp 
 
 A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate.

acres in aggregate. Third party reports for these wildfires indicate over structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. Fire suppression costs estimated by various agencies total approximately million. 
 
 Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, numerous lawsuits have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon, on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damages, economic losses, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and other damages. Additionally, several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned lawsuits. The final determinations of liability, however, will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations and litigation processes. 
 
 PacifiCorp has accrued cumulative estimated probable losses associated with the 2020 Wildfires of million through December 31, 2022. The accrual includes PacifiCorp's estimate of losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time. For certain aspects of the 2020 Wildfires for which loss is considered probable, information necessary to reasonably estimate the potential losses, such as those related to certain areas of natural resource damages, is not currently available. 
 
 It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur additional losses beyond the amounts accrued; however, PacifiCorp is currently unable to estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved and the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details. To the extent losses beyond the amounts accrued are incurred, additional insurance coverage is expected to be available to cover a portion of the losses. 
 
 Accrued losses Payments ) Ending balance 
 
 PacifiCorp's receivable for expected insurance recoveries associated with the probable losses was million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, PacifiCorp recognized probable losses net of expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires of million, and million, respectively. 
 
 171 

million, net of expected insurance recoveries. The loss estimate includes PacifiCorp's estimate of losses for fire suppression costs; real and personal property damages; and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages. PacifiCorp is unable to estimate the total potential loss, including losses for natural resource damages, because there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PacifiCorp. PacifiCorp has insurance available and estimates the potential insurance recoveries to be million, to cover potential losses. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, multiple lawsuits have been filed in California on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2022 McKinney Fire. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damages, economic losses, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and other damages but the amount of damages sought are not specified. The final determinations of liability, however, will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations and litigation processes.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of PacifiCorp during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with PacifiCorp's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K. PacifiCorp's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 920 million, an increase of 32 million, or 4 , compared to 2021, p rimarily due to higher utility margin, lower other expense, including higher allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and lower property and other taxes, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, largely due to higher general and plant maintenance costs and an increase to the wildfire damage provision, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and lower income tax benefit. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher net power cost deferrals, higher retail prices and volumes, higher average wholesale market prices, lower coal-fueled generation volumes and higher net wheeling revenues, partially offset by higher natural gas-fueled generation prices and volumes, higher purchased electricity costs from higher volumes and prices, higher coal-fueled generation prices, lower wind-based ancillary revenues, and lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 1.6 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, favorable impacts of weather and an increase in commercial customer usage, partially offset by a decrease in residential and industrial customer usage. Energy generated decreased 4 for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due lower coal-fueled generation, partially offset by higher wind-powered, natural gas-fueled and hydroelectric-powered generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 5 and purchased electricity volumes increased 20 . 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 888 million, an increase of 149 million, or 20 , compared to 2020, primarily due to higher utility gross margin (excluding 231 million of decreases fully offset in depreciation, operating, other income/expense and income tax expense due to prior year regulatory adjustments); lower operations and maintenance expense primarily due to prior year costs associated with the 2020 Wildfires and changes in how obligations associated with the implementation of the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement will be met; and favorable income tax expense from higher PTCs recognized due to new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and the impacts of ratemaking; partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense (excluding 376 million of decreases offset in operating revenue and income tax expense due to prior year regulatory adjustments) from the impacts of the depreciation study for which rates became effective January 2021 and higher plant in-service; and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction. Utility margin increased 145 million (excluding the 231 million of fully offsetting decreases) primarily due to the higher retail, wheeling and wholesale revenue; higher deferred net power costs; and lower purchased electricity volumes; partially offset by higher purchased electricity prices; and higher natural gas- and coal-fueled generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1 due to increase in customer usage, increase in the average number of customers and favorable impacts of weather. Energy generated increased 10 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due higher wind-powered, natural gas-fueled and coal-fueled generation, partially offset by lower hydroelectric-powered generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 3 and purchased electricity volumes decreased 17 .

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 PacifiCorp's cost of fuel and energy is generally recovered from its retail customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and, as a result, changes in PacifiCorp's expenses included in regulatory recovery mechanisms result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes utility margin more appropriately and concisely explains profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of fuel and energy separately. Management believes the presentation of utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 Utility margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Utility margin increased 235 million, or 7 for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 290 million from higher deferred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms; 
 263 million of higher retail revenue primarily due to higher average prices and higher volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 1.6 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, favorable impacts of weather and an increase in commercial customer usage, partially offset by a decrease in residential and industrial customer usage; 
 103 million of higher wholesale revenue primarily due to higher average market prices, partially offset by lower volumes; 
 44 million of lower coal-fueled generation costs due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher average prices; and 
 19 million of favorable wheeling activities. 
 The increases above were partially offset by: 
 259 million of higher natural gas-fueled generation costs primarily due to higher average market prices and higher volumes; 
 217 million of higher purchased electricity costs from higher volumes and higher average market prices; and 
 10 million of lower wind-based ancillary revenue. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 196 million, or 19 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 64 million increase in the loss accruals associated with the September 2020 wildfires net of estimated insurance recoveries, 38 million of higher plant maintenance costs, 27 million of higher DSM amortization expense (offset in retail revenue), 25 million of changes in the prior year in how obligations associated with the implementation of the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement will be met, 17 million of higher insurance premiums due to cost increases related to wildfire coverage, 37 million of higher consumption of materials, chemical and start-up fuel costs, partially offset by 22 million of deferrals of vegetation management costs in Oregon and Utah, net of higher vegetation management costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 32 million, or 3 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher plant-in-service balances in the current year and prior year deferral of the 2018 depreciation study in Idaho compared to current year amortization, partially offset by current year allocation adjustment for Oregon incremental depreciation of certain coal units and Oregon deferral associated with the depreciation of certain wind-powered generating facilities. 
 
 Property and other taxes decreased 18 million, or 8 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower property tax rates in Utah. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds increased 28 million, or 38 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher qualified construction work-in-progress balances and higher rates. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 20 million, or 83 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the recording of interest on the 2021 Oregon PCAM deferral and higher investment income due to higher average interest rates. 
 
 Other, net decreased 23 million for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies driven by market declines, unfavorable change in deferred compensation and long-term incentive plan primarily due to market movements (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and higher pension costs primarily due to lower expected return on net assets. 
 
 Income tax benefit decreased 17 million, or 22 , for 2022 compared to 2021. The effective tax rate was (7) and (10) for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of lower effects of ratemaking associated with excess deferred income tax amortization and an increase to the valuation allowance for state net operating losses, partially offset by increased PTCs from PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities in the current year. 
 
 185 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 Utility margin decreased 86 million (including the 231 million of fully offsetting decreases) for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to: 
 111 million of higher purchased electricity costs due to higher average prices, partially offset by lower volumes; 
 99 million of lower retail revenue primarily due to 234 million fully offset in depreciation expense, income tax expense, fuel expense, and other income (expense) due to accelerated depreciation of certain coal-fueled units in Utah and Oregon and recognition of certain Utah regulatory balances in the prior year, and lower average retail prices, partially offset by higher retail customer volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1 due to an increase in residential and commercial customer usage, increase in the average number of customers and favorable impacts of weather, primarily in Oregon, Washington and Idaho; 
 88 million of higher natural gas-fueled generation costs primarily due to higher average prices and higher volumes; and 
 34 million of lower other revenue due to prior year recognition of previously deferred other revenue in Oregon that was used to accelerate the depreciation of certain retired wind equipment as a result of the 2020 Oregon RAC settlement (offset in depreciation expense). 
 The decreases above were partially offset by: 
 141 million primarily from higher deferred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms; 
 43 million of favorable wheeling activities; 
 33 million of lower coal-fueled generation costs primarily due to 37 million of accelerated recognition of certain Utah regulatory balances associated with the 2015 Utah mine disposition and certain Cholla Unit 4 related closure costs in Oregon and Idaho (offset in income tax expense) in the prior year and lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes; 
 19 million of higher other revenue primarily due to higher REC, fly ash and by-product revenues; and 
 7 million of higher wholesale revenue due to higher average wholesale market prices, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 178 million, or 15 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prior year estimated losses associated with the 2020 Wildfires of 136 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, changes in how obligations associated with the implementation of the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement will be met, lower thermal plant maintenance expense and lower labor expenses, partially offset by higher wind plant and distribution maintenance and higher legal and insurance expenses associated with the 2020 Wildfires. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 121 million, or 10 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prior year accelerated depreciation of 376 million as a result of regulatory adjustments ordered by the UPSC, the OPUC and the IPUC (fully offset in retail revenue, other revenue, and income tax expense), including accelerated depreciation of certain coal-fueled units and Oregon's share of certain retired wind equipment as a result the 2020 Oregon RAC settlement, partially offset by the impacts of the depreciation study for which rates became effective January 1, 2021 of approximately 158 million and higher plant in-service balances. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 4 million, or 2 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher property taxes in Oregon and Wyoming, partially offset by lower property taxes in Utah and Washington. 
 
 Interest expense increased 4 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances, partially offset by a lower weighted average long-term debt interest rate. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds decreased 72 million, or 49 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower qualified construction work-in-progress balances. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 14 million, or 140 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher carrying charges on DSM regulatory assets in the current year. 
 
 186 

Income tax benefit increased 4 million, or 5 for 2021 compared to 2020. The effective tax rate was (10) and (11) for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of lower effects of ratemaking associated with excess deferred income tax amortization, offset by increased PTCs from PacifiCorp's new wind-powered generating facilities in the current year. In 2020, 118 million of excess deferred income taxes was amortized pursuant to regulatory orders from Utah, Oregon and Idaho, whereby portions of excess deferred income taxes were used to accelerate depreciation of certain coal-fueled units and Oregon's share of certain retired wind equipment or offset other regulatory balances for these jurisdictions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 641 Credit facility (1) 
 1,200 Less: Tax-exempt bond support and letters of credit (249) Net credit facility 951 Total net liquidity 1,592 Credit facility: Maturity date 2025 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K and "Credit Facilities" below for further discussion regarding PacifiCorp's credit facilities. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1.82 billion and 1.80 billion, respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher collections from retail customers, collateral received from counterparties, transmission deposits and cash received for income taxes, partially offset by higher fuel, wholesale and material and supplies purchases. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 1.8 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher cash received for income taxes and higher collections from retail customers, partially offset by higher wholesale purchases and timing of operating payables. 
 
 The timing of PacifiCorp's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (2.2) billion and (1.5) billion, respectively. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities is mainly due to an increase in capital expenditures of 653 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (1.5) billion and (2.5) billion, respectively. The decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities is mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 1.0 billion. 
 
 187 

Financing Activities 
 
 Short-term Debt 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, regulatory authorities limited PacifiCorp to 1.5 billion of short-term debt. In January 2023, updated regulatory authorization provided PacifiCorp with an increased limit to 2.0 billion of short-term debt. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PacifiCorp had no short-term debt outstanding. For further discussion, refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K. 
 
 Long-term Debt 
 
 In December 2022, PacifiCorp issued 1.1 billion of its 5.350 First Mortgage Bonds due December 2053. PacifiCorp intends within 24 months of the issuance date to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing investments or expenditures made in one or more eligible projects in alignment with BHE's Green Financing Framework. Proceeds will not knowingly be allocated to the same portion of a project that received allocation of proceeds under any other Green Financing Instrument; activities related to the exploration, production, transportation, or consumption of fossil fuels; or activities related to nuclear energy. 
 
 PacifiCorp made repayments on long-term debt totaling 155 million and 870 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 PacifiCorp's Mortgage and Deed of Trust creates a lien on most of PacifiCorp's electric utility property, allowing the issuance of bonds based on a percentage of utility property additions, bond credits arising from retirement of previously outstanding bonds or deposits of cash. The amount of bonds that PacifiCorp may issue generally is also subject to a net earnings test. As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp estimated it would be able to issue up to 8.5 billion of new first mortgage bonds under the most restrictive issuance test in the mortgage. Any issuances are subject to market conditions and amounts are further limited by regulatory authorizations or commitments or by covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements. PacifiCorp also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage on the basis of property additions, bond credits or deposits of cash. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 
 In June 2022, PacifiCorp amended and restated its existing 1.2 billion unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2024. The amendment extended the expiration date to June 2025 and amended pricing from the London Interbank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 
 
 In January 2023, PacifiCorp entered into an additional 800 million 364-day unsecured credit facility expiring in January 2024. 
 
 Debt Authorizations 
 
 PacifiCorp currently has regulatory authority from the OPUC and the IPUC to issue an additional 900 million of long-term debt. PacifiCorp must make a notice filing with the WUTC prior to any future issuance. PacifiCorp currently has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue an indeterminate amount of first mortgage bonds through September 2023. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PacifiCorp had non-redeemable preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate stated value of 2 million. 
 
 Common Shareholder's Equity 
 
 In 2022 and 2021, PacifiCorp declared and paid dividends of 100 million and 150 million, respectively, to PPW Holdings LLC. 
 
 In January 2023, PacifiCorp declared dividends of 300 million payable to PPW Holdings LLC in February 2023. 
 
 188 

Capitalization 
 
 PacifiCorp manages its capitalization and liquidity position to maintain a prudent capital structure with the objective of retaining strong investment grade credit ratings, which is expected to facilitate continuing access to flexible borrowing arrangements at favorable costs and rates. This objective, subject to periodic review and revision, attempts to balance the interests of all shareholders, customers and creditors and provide a competitive cost of capital and predictable capital market access. 
 
 Under existing or prospective authoritative accounting guidance, such as guidance pertaining to consolidations and leases, it is possible that new purchase power and gas agreements, transmission arrangements or amendments to existing arrangements may be accounted for as lease obligations on PacifiCorp's financial statements. While PacifiCorp has successfully amended covenants in financing arrangements that may be impacted, it may be more difficult for PacifiCorp to comply with its capitalization targets or regulatory commitments concerning minimum levels of common equity as a percentage of capitalization. This may lead PacifiCorp to seek amendments or waivers under financing agreements and from regulators, delay or reduce dividends or spending programs, seek additional new equity contributions from its indirect parent company, BHE, or take other actions. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 PacifiCorp has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which PacifiCorp has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including PacifiCorp's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk associated with PacifiCorp and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 PacifiCorp has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customer rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings, including regulatory filings for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; new customer requests; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 Historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 Historical Forecast 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Wind generation 1,278 131 37 797 422 302 Electric distribution 603 608 678 658 536 894 Electric transmission 415 325 1,208 1,431 1,120 1,586 Solar generation 24 93 286 Electric battery and pumped hydro storage 5 8 32 105 361 Other 244 444 235 637 793 557 Total 2,540 1,513 2,166 3,579 3,069 3,986 
 
 189 

PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP identified a roadmap for a significant increase in renewable and carbon free generation resources, coal-to-natural gas conversion of certain coal-fueled units, energy storage and associated transmission. PacifiCorp's 2021 IRP identified over 1,800 MWs of new wind-powered generation, over 2,100 MWs of new solar-powered generation and nearly 700 MWs of new battery storage capacity that are expected to be online by 2025. PacifiCorp anticipates that the additional new wind-powered generation will be a mixture of owned and contracted resources. PacifiCorp has included an estimate for these new generation resources and associated transmission in its forecast capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. These estimates are likely to change as a result of the RFP process. PacifiCorp's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 
 Wind generation includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects include construction of new wind-powered generating facilities and construction at existing wind-powered generating facility sites acquired from third parties totaling 23 million for 2022, 118 million for 2021 and 1,148 million for 2020. PacifiCorp placed in-service 516 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities in 2021 and 674 MWs in 2020. Planned spending for the construction of additional new wind-powered generating facilities and those at acquired sites totals 771 million in 2023, 385 million in 2024 and 251 million in 2025 and is primarily for projects totaling approximately 683 MWs that are expected to be placed in-service in 2023 through 2025. 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Operating expenditures includes spend on wildfire mitigation. Expenditures for these items totaled 135 million in 2022, 54 million in 2021 and 28 million in 2020, and planned spending totals 90 million in 2023, 124 million in 2024 and 127 million in 2025. The remaining investments primarily relate to expenditures for new connections and distribution operations. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Transmission growth investments primarily reflects costs associated with Energy Gateway Transmission projects. Expenditures for these projects totaled 944 million for 2022, 94 million for 2021 and 56 million for 2020. Forecast expenditures for Energy Gateway projects include planned costs for the following Energy Gateway Transmission segments: 
 416-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Aeolus substation near Medicine Bow, Wyoming and the Clover substation near Mona, Utah; 
 59-mile, 230-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Windstar substation near Glenrock, Wyoming and the Aeolus substation; 
 290-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Longhorn substation near Boardman, Oregon to the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho; 
 14-mile, 345-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Oquirrh substation in the Salt Lake Valley and the Terminal substation near the Salt Lake City Airport; 
 40-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Limber substation in central Utah and the Terminal substation; and 
 195-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Anticline substation near Point of Rocks, Wyoming and the Populus substation in Downey, Idaho. 
 Planned spending for these Energy Gateway Transmission segments that are expected to be placed in-service in 2024 through 2028 totals 1,005 million in 2023, 661 million in 2024 and 763 million in 2025. The remaining investments primarily relate to expenditures for transmission operations, including wildfire mitigation, generation interconnection requests and other Energy Gateway Transmission segments. 
 Solar generation includes growth projects. Planned spending for the construction of new solar projects will add approximately 377 MWs of new generation and are expected to be placed in-service in 2026. 
 Electric battery and pumped hydro storage includes growth projects. Planned spending for the construction of storage projects from 2023 through 2025 includes 319 million for battery storage projects providing approximately 419 MWs of storage that are expected to be placed in-service in 2026 and 79 million for the construction of 38 MWs of new pumped hydro storage on the North Umpqua River system expected to be placed in-service in 2024 and 2026. The remaining investments relate to planned spending on projects that are expected to be placed in-service beyond 2026. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Expenditures for information technology totaled 155 million in 2022, 108 million in 2021 and 75 million for 2020. Planned information technology spending totals 224 million in 2023, 181 million in 2024 and 232 million in 2025. The remaining investments relate to operating projects that consist of routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 From time to time, PacifiCorp enters into arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties that involve guarantees or similar arrangements. PacifiCorp currently has indemnification obligations in connection with the sale or transfer of certain assets. In addition, PacifiCorp evaluates potential obligations that arise out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities, determined in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. PacifiCorp believes that the likelihood that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these obligations is remote. Refer to Notes 11 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for more information on these obligations and arrangements. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 PacifiCorp has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long-term debt (refer to Note 8), certain commitments and contingencies (refer to Note 14), cost of removal and AROs (refer to Notes 6 and 11). Refer to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 PacifiCorp has cash requirements relating to interest payments of 8.0 billion on long-term debt, including 449 million due in 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding PacifiCorp's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, water quality, emissions performance standards, coal ash disposal, wildfire prevention and mitigation and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact PacifiCorp's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. PacifiCorp believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and PacifiCorp is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt and preferred securities of PacifiCorp are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of PacifiCorp's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp's credit ratings for its senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. 
 
 PacifiCorp has no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. PacifiCorp's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities. Certain authorizations or exemptions by regulatory commissions for the issuance of securities are valid as long as PacifiCorp maintains investment grade ratings on senior secured debt. A downgrade below that level would necessitate new regulatory applications and approvals. 
 
 191 

In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance" if there is a material adverse change in PacifiCorp's creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp would have been required to post 433 million of additional collateral. PacifiCorp's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, outstanding accounts payable and receivable or other factors. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for a discussion of PacifiCorp's collateral requirements specific to PacifiCorp's derivative contracts. 

Inflation 
 
 PacifiCorp operates under a cost-of-service based rate-setting structure administered by various state commissions and the FERC. Under this rate-setting structure, PacifiCorp is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation. PacifiCorp seeks to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations through the use of energy and other cost adjustment clauses and tariff riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and entering into contracts with fixed pricing where possible by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by PacifiCorp's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with PacifiCorp's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 PacifiCorp prepares its financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, PacifiCorp defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in rates occur. 
 
 PacifiCorp continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit PacifiCorp's ability to recover its costs. PacifiCorp believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at both the federal and state levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 1.9 billion and total regulatory liabilities were 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for additional information regarding PacifiCorp's regulatory assets and liabilities.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 PacifiCorp sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as described in Note 10. PacifiCorp recognizes the funded status of these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp recognized a net asset totaling 57 million for the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2022, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost included in net regulatory assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled 255 million and 12 million, respectively. 
 
 The expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. PacifiCorp believes that the key assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about PacifiCorp's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 PacifiCorp chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date with cash flows aligning to the expected timing and amount of plan liabilities. 
 
 In establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, PacifiCorp evaluates the investment allocation between return-seeking investment and fixed income securities based on the funded status of the plan and utilizes the asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on forward-looking views of the financial markets and historical performance. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. PacifiCorp regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 
 
 The key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (in millions): 
 Other Postretirement Pension Plans Benefit Plan +0.5 -0.5 +0.5 -0.5 Effect on December 31, 2022 Benefit Obligations: Discount rate (25) 26 (8) 8 Effect on 2022 Periodic Cost: Discount rate 1 (1) 1 (1) Expected rate of return on plan assets (5) 5 (2) 2 
 
 A variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and PacifiCorp's funding policy for each plan. 
 
 193 

Income Taxes 
 
 In determining PacifiCorp's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by PacifiCorp's various regulatory commissions. PacifiCorp's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. PacifiCorp recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of PacifiCorp's federal, state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, PacifiCorp believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on PacifiCorp's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding PacifiCorp's income taxes. 
 
 It is probable that PacifiCorp will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to customers in certain state jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 1.2 billion and will primarily be included in regulated rates over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue 
 
 Revenue is recognized as electricity is delivered or services are provided. The determination of customer billings is based on a systematic reading of meters. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was 301 million as of December 31, 2022. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Estimates are reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on subsequent meter readings. 
 
 Wildfire Loss Contingencies 
 
 As a result of several wildfires that have occurred in PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas in Oregon and California, PacifiCorp is required to evaluate its exposure to potential loss contingencies arising from claims associated with the wildfires. In determining this exposure, PacifiCorp is required to assess whether the likelihood of loss for each of the wildfires and lawsuits is remote, reasonably possible or probable, which involves complex judgments based on several variables including available information regarding the cause and origin of the wildfires, investigations, discovery associated with lawsuits and negotiations with various parties. If deemed reasonably possible, PacifiCorp is required to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss and disclose any material amounts. If deemed probable, PacifiCorp is required to accrue a loss if reasonably estimable based on the bottom end of the range if no amount within the range of estimated loss is any better than another amount. Many assumptions and variables are involved in determining these estimates, including identifying the various categories of potential loss such as fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages. Within the categories of potential loss, further assumptions are made regarding items such as the types of structures damaged, estimated replacement values associated with those structures, value of personal property, the types of natural resource damage such as timber, the value of that timber, the nature of noneconomic damages such as those arising from personal injuries, other damages PacifiCorp may be responsible for if found negligent such as punitive damages, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding PacifiCorp's loss contingencies associated with the 2020 Wildfires and the 2022 McKinney fire. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp's Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. PacifiCorp's significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which PacifiCorp transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with PacifiCorp's business activities. PacifiCorp has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for additional information regarding PacifiCorp's contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 194 

PacifiCorp has a risk management committee that is responsible for the oversight of market and credit risk relating to the commodity transactions of PacifiCorp. To limit PacifiCorp's exposure to market and credit risk, the risk management committee recommends, and executive management establishes, policies, limits and approved products, which are reviewed frequently to respond to changing market conditions. 
 
 Risk is an inherent part of PacifiCorp's business and activities. PacifiCorp has established a risk management process that is designed to identify, assess, manage and report on each of the various types of risk involved in PacifiCorp's business. The risk management policy governs energy transactions and is designed for hedging PacifiCorp's existing energy and asset exposures, and to a limited extent, the policy permits arbitrage and trading activities to take advantage of market inefficiencies. The policy also governs the types of transactions authorized for use and establishes guidelines for credit risk management and management information systems required to effectively monitor such transactions. PacifiCorp's risk management policy provides for the use of only those contracts that have a similar volume or price relationship to its portfolio of assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp is principally exposed to electricity, natural gas, coal and fuel oil commodity price risk as PacifiCorp has an obligation to serve retail customer load in its service territories. PacifiCorp's load and generating facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposures to commodity prices consist mainly of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity and wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage, and transmission and transportation constraints. PacifiCorp does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, PacifiCorp uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. PacifiCorp does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. PacifiCorp's exposure to commodity price risk is generally limited by its ability to include commodity costs in rates, which is subject to regulatory lag that occurs between the time the costs are incurred and when the costs are included in rates, as well as the impact of any customer sharing resulting from cost adjustment mechanisms. 
 
 PacifiCorp measures, monitors and manages the market risk in its electricity and natural gas portfolio in comparison to established thresholds and measures its open positions subject to price risk in terms of quantity at each delivery location for each forward time period. PacifiCorp has a risk management policy that requires increasing volumes of hedge transactions over a three-year position management and hedging horizon to reduce market risk of its electricity and natural gas portfolio. 
 
 PacifiCorp maintained compliance with its risk management policy and limit procedures during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 The table that follows summarizes PacifiCorp's price risk on commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives, excluding collateral netting of (78) million and 5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10 increase and 10 decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios (dollars in millions): 
 Fair Value - Estimated Fair Value after Net Asset Hypothetical Change in Price (Liability) 10 increase 10 decrease As of December 31, 2022: Total commodity derivative contracts 270 381 159 As of December 31, 2021: Total commodity derivative contracts 53 104 2 
 
 195 

PacifiCorp's commodity derivative contracts are generally recoverable from customers in rates; therefore, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on commodity derivative contracts do not expose PacifiCorp to earnings volatility. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a regulatory liability of 270 million and 53 million, respectively, was recorded related to the net derivative asset of 270 million and 53 million, respectively. Consolidated financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, natural gas or fuel are higher or the level of wholesale electricity sales are lower than what is included in rates, including the impacts of adjustment mechanisms. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. PacifiCorp manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, PacifiCorp's fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose PacifiCorp to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if PacifiCorp were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. PacifiCorp has the ability to enter into interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps or locks, to mitigate PacifiCorp's exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of PacifiCorp's short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Notes 7, 8 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of PacifiCorp's short- and long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PacifiCorp had long-term variable-rate obligations totaling 218 million that expose PacifiCorp to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. The market risk related to PacifiCorp's variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2022 is not hedged. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on PacifiCorp's consolidated annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent PacifiCorp's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, PacifiCorp analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, PacifiCorp enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, PacifiCorp exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp's aggregate credit exposure with wholesale energy supply and marketing counterparties included counterparties having non-investment grade, internally rated credit ratings. Substantially all of these non-investment grade, internally rated counterparties are associated with long-duration solar and wind power purchase agreements, some of which are from facilities that have not yet achieved commercial operation and for which PacifiCorp has no obligation should the facilities not achieve commercial operation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PacifiCorp 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PacifiCorp and subsidiaries ("PacifiCorp") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PacifiCorp as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of PacifiCorp's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on PacifiCorp's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to PacifiCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. PacifiCorp is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of PacifiCorp's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 PacifiCorp is subject to rate regulation by state public service commissions as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively the "Commissions") , which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas companies in the respective service territories where PacifiCorp operates. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 198 

Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow PacifiCorp an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While PacifiCorp has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions ' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit PacifiCorp's ability to recover its costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management ' s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated PacifiCorp's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected PacifiCorp's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management ' s assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. 
 
 Wildfires Contingencies Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 As a result of several wildfires that have occurred in PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas in Oregon and California, PacifiCorp is required to evaluate its exposure to potential loss contingencies arising from claims associated with the 2020 Wildfires and the 2022 McKinney Fire (the "Wildfires"). In determining this exposure, PacifiCorp is required to determine whether the likelihood of loss for each of the Wildfires is remote, reasonably possible or probable, which involves complex judgments based on several variables including available information regarding the cause and origin of the Wildfires, investigations, discovery associated with lawsuits and negotiations with claimants. 
 
 A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If deemed reasonably possible, PacifiCorp is required to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss and disclose any material amounts. 
 
 Management has recorded estimated liabilities of 424 million and receivables of 246 million, which represent its best estimate of probable losses and expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, PacifiCorp recognized probable losses net of expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires of 64 million, million and 136 million, respectively. Management has disclosed reasonably possible estimated losses of 31 million, net of potential insurance recoveries of 103 million, associated with the 2022 McKinney Fire. 
 
 199 

We identified wildfire-related contingencies and the related disclosures as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to determine the probability of loss and estimate the probable or reasonably possible losses and insurance recoveries. This required the application of a high degree of judgment and extensive effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management ' s judgments, estimates and disclosures related to wildfire-related loss contingencies. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to management ' s judgments regarding the probability of loss, estimated losses and insurance recoveries, and related disclosures for wildfire-related contingencies included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated management ' s judgments related to whether a loss was probable or reasonably possible for the Wildfires by inquiring of management and PacifiCorp ' s external and internal legal counsel regarding the likelihood and amounts of probable and reasonably possible losses, including the potential impact of information gained through investigations into the cause of the fires, information from claimants, the advice of legal counsel, and reading external information for any evidence that might contradict management ' s assertions. 
 We evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable and reasonably possible losses through inquiries with management and external and internal legal counsel, and we tested the significant assumptions used in the estimates of probable and reasonably possible losses. 
 We read legal letters from PacifiCorp ' s external and internal legal counsel regarding known information and evaluated whether the information therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures. 
 We evaluated management's judgments related to whether related insurance recoveries were probable of collection by inquiring of management and PacifiCorp's external and internal legal counsel regarding the amounts of insurance recoveries recorded or disclosed. With the assistance of our insurance specialists, we tested the significant assumptions used in the determination of collectability, including obtaining and reading related policies to determine whether the types of insurance claims are included or excluded from coverage. 
 We evaluated whether PacifiCorp's disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.

 Equity Method Investments 
 
 PacifiCorp utilizes the equity method of accounting with respect to investments when it possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when an investor possesses more than 20 of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. In applying the equity method, PacifiCorp records the investment at cost and subsequently increases or decreases the carrying value of the investment by PacifiCorp's proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") of the investee. PacifiCorp records dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment.

 In December 2022, PacifiCorp issued billion of its First Mortgage Bonds due December 2053. PacifiCorp intends within 24 months of the issuance date to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing investments or expenditures made in one or more eligible projects in alignment with BHE's Green Financing Framework. Proceeds will not knowingly be allocated to the same portion of a project that received allocation of proceeds under any other Green Financing Instrument; activities related to the exploration, production, transportation, or consumption of fossil fuels; or activities related to nuclear energy. 
 
 PacifiCorp's long-term debt generally includes provisions that allow PacifiCorp to redeem the first mortgage bonds in whole or in part at any time through the payment of a make-whole premium. Variable-rate tax-exempt bond obligations are generally redeemable at par value.

 Income tax credits relate primarily to production tax credits ("PTC") earned by PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities. Federal renewable electricity PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying wind-powered generating facilities is produced and sold and are based on a per-kilowatt hour rate pursuant to the applicable federal income tax law. Wind-powered generating facilities are eligible for the credits for years from the date the qualifying generating facilities are placed in-service. PTCs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 Effects of ratemaking is primarily attributable to activity associated with excess deferred income taxes. Excess deferred income tax amortization, net of deferrals, was million for 2022. Excess deferred income tax amortization, net of deferrals, was million for 2021, including the use of million to amortize certain regulatory balances in Wyoming and Idaho. Excess deferred income tax amortization, net of deferrals, was million for 2020, including the use of million to accelerate depreciation of certain retired equipment and to amortize certain regulatory balances in Idaho, Oregon and Utah.

 As a result of a plan amendment effective on January 1, 2017, the benefit obligation for the Retirement Plan is no longer affected by future increases in compensation. As a result of a labor settlement reached with UMWA in December 2014, the benefit obligation for the other postretirement plan is no longer affected by healthcare cost trends. 
 
 Contributions and Benefit Payments 
 
 Employer contributions to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are expected to be million and , respectively, during 2023. Funding to PacifiCorp's Retirement Plan trust is based upon the actuarially determined costs of the plan and the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended ("PPA of 2006"). PacifiCorp considers contributing additional amounts from time to time in order to achieve certain funding levels specified under the PPA of 2006. PacifiCorp evaluates a variety of factors, including funded status, income tax laws and regulatory requirements, in determining contributions to its other postretirement benefit plan.

 Investment Policy and Asset Allocations 
 
 PacifiCorp's investment policy for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to balance risk and return through a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equity securities and other alternative investments. Maturities for debt securities are managed to targets consistent with prudent risk tolerances. The plans retain outside investment consultants to advise on plan investments within the parameters outlined by the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company Investment Committee. The investment portfolio is managed in line with the investment policy with sufficient liquidity to meet near-term benefit payments.

Shares of mutual funds not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, private equity limited partnership interests, common and commingled trust funds and investment entities are reported at fair value based on the net asset value per unit, which is used for expedience purposes. A fund's net asset value is based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the fund less its liabilities. 
 
 Multiemployer and Joint Trustee Pension Plans 
 
 PacifiCorp contributes to the PacifiCorp/IBEW Local 57 Retirement Trust Fund ("Local 57 Trust Fund") (plan number 001) and its subsidiary, Energy West Mining Company, previously contributed to the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan (plan number 002). Contributions to these pension plans are based on the terms of collective bargaining agreements.

million. Energy West Mining Company began making installment payments in November 2016 and has the option to elect a lump sum payment to settle the withdrawal obligation. The ultimate amount paid by Energy West Mining Company to settle the obligation is dependent on a variety of factors, including the results of ongoing negotiations with the plan trustees. 
 
 The Local 57 Trust Fund is a joint trustee plan such that the board of trustees is represented by an equal number of trustees from PacifiCorp and the union. The Local 57 Trust Fund was established pursuant to the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act and although formed with the ability for other employers to participate in the plan, there are no other employers that participate in this plan. 
 
 The risk of participating in multiemployer pension plans generally differs from single-employer plans in that assets are pooled such that contributions by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and plan assets cannot revert to employers. If an employer ceases participation in the plan, the employer may be obligated to pay a withdrawal liability based on the participants' unfunded, vested benefits in the plan. This occurred as a result of Energy West Mining Company's withdrawal from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan. If participating employers withdraw from a multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.

 Credit Risk 
 
 PacifiCorp is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent PacifiCorp's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, PacifiCorp analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, PacifiCorp enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, PacifiCorp exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance" if there is a material adverse change in PacifiCorp's creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, PacifiCorp's credit ratings for its senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. 
 
 The aggregate fair value of PacifiCorp's derivative contracts in liability positions with specific credit-risk-related contingent features totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which PacifiCorp had posted collateral of and million, respectively, in the form of cash deposits. If all credit-risk-related contingent features for derivative contracts in liability positions had been triggered as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PacifiCorp would have been required to post million and million, respectively, of additional collateral. PacifiCorp's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation or other factors.

 Purchased Electricity Contracts - Commercially Operable 
 
 As part of its energy resource portfolio, PacifiCorp acquires a portion of its electricity through long-term purchases and exchange agreements. PacifiCorp has many long-term PPAs primarily with solar-powered or wind-powered generating facilities that are not included in the table above due to there being no minimum payments generally due to being dependent on wind and solar conditions. The PPAs generally range from to years in duration, with certain of the PPAs extending through 2054. Future payments associated with these PPAs are expected to be material. Certain of these PPAs qualify as leases as described in Note 2. Refer to Note 5 for variable lease costs associated with these lease commitments. 
 
 Included in the minimum fixed annual payments for purchased electricity above are commitments to purchase electricity from several hydroelectric systems under long-term arrangements with public utility districts. These purchases are made on a "cost-of-service" basis for a stated percentage of system output and for a like percentage of system operating expenses and debt service. These costs are included in energy costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. PacifiCorp is required to pay its portion of operating costs and its portion of the debt service, whether or not any electricity is produced. These arrangements accounted for less than of PacifiCorp's 2022, 2021 and 2020 energy sources. 
 
 Purchased Electricity Contracts - Non-Commercially Operable 
 
 PacifiCorp has many long-term PPAs with facilities that have not yet achieved commercial operation, primarily related to wind-powered and solar-powered generated facilities and including with facilities that are not included in the table above due to there being no minimum payments generally due to being dependent on wind and solar conditions. The PPAs generally range from to years in duration with certain of the PPAs extending through 2054. 
 
 In September 2022, PacifiCorp entered into a purchased electricity contract for a 400 MW solar generating facility including a 200 MW battery storage unit. Minimum obligations associated with the battery storage unit are included in the table above. In January 2023, PacifiCorp entered into a PPA for a 525 MW solar generating facility with a corresponding agreement for a 150 MW battery storage unit for which the minimum obligations are being evaluated. 
 
 Future payments associated with these arrangements are expected to be material. However, to the extent these facilities do not achieve commercial obligation, PacifiCorp has no obligation to the counterparties.

million plus million in California bond funds; (2) complete indemnification from harms associated with dam removal; (3) transfer of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") license to a third-party dam removal entity, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation ("KRRC"), who would conduct dam removal; and (4) ability for PacifiCorp to operate the facilities for the benefit of customers until dam removal commences. 
 
 In September 2016, the KRRC and PacifiCorp filed a joint application with the FERC to transfer the license for the four mainstem Klamath hydroelectric dams comprising the Lower Klamath Project (FERC Project No. 14803) from PacifiCorp to the KRRC. The FERC approved the partial transfer of the Klamath license in a July 2020 order, subject to the condition that PacifiCorp remains co-licensee. Under the amended KHSA, PacifiCorp did not agree to remain co-licensee during the surrender and removal process given concerns about liability protections for PacifiCorp and its customers. In November 2020, PacifiCorp entered a memorandum of agreement (the "MOA") with the KRRC, the Karuk Tribe, the Yurok Tribe and the States to continue implementation of the KHSA. The agreement required the States, PacifiCorp and KRRC to file a new license transfer application to remove PacifiCorp from the license for the Lower Klamath Project and add the States and KRRC as co-licensees for the purposes of surrender. In addition, the MOA provides for additional contingency funding of million, equally split between PacifiCorp and the States, and for PacifiCorp and the States to equally share in any additional cost overruns in the unlikely event that dam removal costs exceed the million in funding to ensure dam removal is complete. The MOA also requires PacifiCorp to cover the costs associated with certain pre-existing environmental conditions. In June 2021, the FERC approved the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams from PacifiCorp to the KRRC and the States as co-licensees. In July 2021, the Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho and California state public utility commissions conditionally approved the required property transfer applications. In August 2021, PacifiCorp notified the Public Service Commission of Utah of the property transfer, however no formal approval is required in Utah. In August 2022, the FERC staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the project, concluding that dam removal is the preferred action. In November 2022, the FERC issued a license surrender order for the project, which was accepted by the KRRC and the States in December 2022, along with the transfer of the Lower Klamath Project dams. Although PacifiCorp no longer owns the Lower Klamath Project, PacifiCorp will continue to operate the facilities under an operation and maintenance agreement with the KRRC until each facility is ready for removal. Removal of the Copco No. 2 facility is anticipated to begin in 2023, and removal of the remaining three dams (J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 1, and Iron Gate) is anticipated to begin in 2024.

 Legal Matters 
 
 PacifiCorp is party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. PacifiCorp does not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. PacifiCorp is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines, penalties and other costs in substantial amounts and are described below. 
 
 Wildfires Overview 
 
 A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. 
 
 In California, under inverse condemnation, courts have held that investor-owned utilities can be liable for real and personal property damages from wildfires without the utility being found negligent and regardless of fault. California law also permits inverse condemnation plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. In both Oregon and California, PacifiCorp has equipment in areas accessed through special use permits, easements or similar agreements that may contain provisions requiring it to pay for damages caused by its equipment regardless of fault. Even if inverse condemnation or other provisions do not apply, PacifiCorp could be found liable for all damages proximately caused by negligence, including real and personal property and natural resource damages; fire suppression costs; personal injury and loss of life damages; and interest. 
 
 2020 Wildfires 
 
 In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp's service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon burning over acres in aggregate. Third party reports for these wildfires indicate over structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. Fire suppression costs estimated by various agencies total approximately million. 
 
 Investigations into the cause and origin of each wildfire are complex and ongoing and being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, numerous lawsuits have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon, on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damages, economic losses, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and other damages. Additionally, several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned lawsuits. The final determinations of liability, however, will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations and litigation processes. 
 
 PacifiCorp has accrued cumulative estimated probable losses associated with the 2020 Wildfires of million, through December 31, 2022. The accrual includes PacifiCorp's estimate of losses for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is reasonably able to estimate at this time. For certain aspects of the 2020 Wildfires for which loss is considered probable, information necessary to reasonably estimate the potential losses, such as those related to certain areas of natural resource damages, is not currently available.

Accrued losses Payments ) Ending balance 
 
 PacifiCorp's receivable for expected insurance recoveries associated with the probable losses was million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, PacifiCorp recognized probable losses net of expected insurance recoveries associated with the 2020 Wildfires of million, and million, respectively. 
 
 2022 McKinney Fire 
 
 According to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, on July 29, 2022, at approximately 2:16 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California (the "2022 McKinney Fire") located in PacifiCorp's service territory. Third party reports indicate that the 2022 McKinney Fire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities and consumed 60,000 acres. The cause of the 2022 McKinney Fire is undetermined and remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service. 
 
 Due to the preliminary nature of the investigation PacifiCorp does not believe a loss is probable and therefore has not accrued any loss as of the date of this filing. While the loss is not probable, PacifiCorp estimates the potential loss, excluding losses for natural resource damages, to be million, net of expected insurance recoveries. The loss estimate includes PacifiCorp's estimate of losses for fire suppression costs; real and personal property damages; and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages. PacifiCorp is unable to estimate the total potential loss, including losses for natural resource damages, because there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PacifiCorp. PacifiCorp has insurance available and estimates the potential insurance recoveries to be million, to cover potential losses. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, multiple lawsuits have been filed in California on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2022 McKinney Fire. The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damages, economic losses, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and other damages but the amount of damages sought are not specified. The final determinations of liability, however, will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations and litigation processes. 
 
 Guarantees 
 
 PacifiCorp has entered into guarantees as part of the normal course of business and the sale or transfer of certain assets. These guarantees are not expected to have a material impact on PacifiCorp's consolidated financial results.

The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of MidAmerican Funding and its subsidiaries and MidAmerican Energy during the periods included herein. Information in Management's Discussion and Analysis related to MidAmerican Energy, whether or not segregated, also relates to MidAmerican Funding. Information related to other subsidiaries of MidAmerican Funding pertains only to the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of MidAmerican Funding. Where necessary, discussions have been segregated under the heading "MidAmerican Funding" to allow the reader to identify information applicable only to MidAmerican Funding. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with MidAmerican Funding's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and MidAmerican Energy's historical Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements each in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MidAmerican Funding's and MidAmerican Energy's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 MidAmerican Energy - 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net income for 2022 was 961 million, an increase of 67 million, or 7 , compared to 2021 primarily d ue to higher electric utility margin, a favorable income tax benefit, higher natural gas utility margin and higher AFUDC, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, unfavorable changes in the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, higher non-service benefit plan costs, higher interest expense and lower nonregulated utility margin. Electric utility margin increased due to higher wholesale utility margin from higher margins per unit and higher wholesale customer volumes of 12.2 and higher retail u tility margin, largely from higher retail customer volumes. Retail customer volumes increased 4.3 due to higher customer usage, reflecting the favorable impact of weather and an increase in certain industrial customer usage . Energy generated increased 6 primarily due to higher wind-powered generation, partially offset by lower coal-fueled generation, and energy purchased increased 19 . The favorable income tax benefit was mainly due to higher PTCs recognized from higher wind- and solar-powered generation, partially offset by the timing of state income tax benefits. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily from the impacts of certain regulatory mechanisms and additional assets placed in-service. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net income for 2021 was 894 million, an increase of 68 million, or 8 , compared to 2020 primarily due to higher electric utility margin and a favorable income tax benefit, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher operations and maintenance expense and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to a higher retail utility margin, largely from higher customer volumes and price impacts from changes in sales mix, and higher wholesale utility margin from higher margins per unit and higher wholesale customer volumes of 42.7 . Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8 primarily due to higher customer usage for certain industrial customers. Energy generated increased 26 primarily due to higher coal-fueled generation and higher wind-powered generation, and energy purchased decreased 35 . Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as well as higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by 2020 costs associated with storm restoration activities. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher regulatory mechanisms and additional assets placed in-service. The favorable income tax benefit was from higher PTCs recognized due to new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in late 2020 and 2021, state income tax impacts and lower pretax income. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding - 
 
 MidAmerican Funding's net income for 2022 was 947 million, an increase of 64 million, or 7 , compared to 2021. MidAmerican Funding's net income for 2021 was 883 million, an increase of 65 million, or 8 , compared to 2020. The increases were primarily due to the changes in MidAmerican Energy's earnings discussed above. 

242 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Electric utility margin is calculated as regulated electric operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Statements of Operations. Natural gas utility margin is calculated as regulated natural gas operating revenue less cost of natural gas purchased for resale, which are included in regulated natural gas and other and cost of natural gas purchased for resale and other, respectively, on the Statements of Operations. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's cost of fuel and energy and cost of natural gas purchased for resale are generally recovered from its retail customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and, as a result, changes in MidAmerican Energy's expenses included in regulatory recovery mechanisms result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin more appropriately and concisely explain profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of sales separately. Management believes the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to managing the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 
 Electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 MidAmerican Energy - 
 
 Electric utility margin increased 319 million, or 16 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 a 250 million increase in wholesale utility margin due to higher margins per unit of 237 million, reflecting higher market prices and lower energy costs, and higher volumes of 12.2 ; 
 a 66 million increase in retail utility margin primarily due to 62 million from higher customer usage, including 7 million from the favorable impact of weather; and 9 million, net of energy costs, from higher recoveries through bill riders (offset in operations and maintenance expense and income tax benefit); partially offset by 6 million in 2021 from liquidated damages related to a wind-powered generation project. Retail customer volumes increased 4.3 ; and 
 a 3 million increase in Multi-Value Projects ("MVP") transmission revenue. 
 Natural gas utility margin increased 25 million, or 10 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 an 18 million increase in customer usage, including 9 million from the favorable impact of weather; 
 a 5 million increase from higher refunds related to amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes arising from in 2017 Tax Reform (offset in income tax benefit); and 
 a 3 million increase in natural gas transportation margin, reflecting higher prices. 
 245 

Operations and maintenance increased 53 million, or 7 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher other power generation costs of 21 million from additional wind turbines and easements, higher electric distribution costs of 17 million reflecting greater tree-trimming efforts, higher steam generation costs of 13 million and higher transmission costs from MISO of 6 million, partially offset by lower gas distribution costs of 6 million. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 254 million, or 28 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to 181 million from higher Iowa revenue sharing accruals, 40 million related to new and repowered wind-powered generating facilities and other plant placed in-service and 31 million from a regulatory mechanism that provides customers the retail energy benefits of certain wind-powered generation projects. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 7 million, or 5 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher wind turbine property taxes. 
 
 Interest expense increased 11 million, or 4 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a higher average long-term debt balance and higher variable interest rates. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds increased 14 million, or 27 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher construction work-in-progress balances related to wind- and solar-powered generation projects. 
 
 Other, net decreased 53 million, or 100 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower cash surrender values of corporate-owned life insurance policies of 37 million, higher non-service costs of postretirement employee benefit plans of 17 million and lower other investment values, partially offset by higher interest income. 
 
 Income tax benefit increased 95 million, or 14 , for 2022 compared to 2021, and the effective tax rate was (403) for 2022 and (308) for 2021. The change in the effective tax rate was substantially due to an increase of 136 million in PTCs, partially offset by state income tax impacts. 
 
 Federal renewable electricity PTCs are earned as energy from qualifying wind- and solar-powered generating facilities is produced and sold and are based on a prescribed per-kilowatt rate pursuant to the applicable federal income tax law. Qualifying generating facilities are eligible for the credits for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. Beginning in late 2014, some of MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities surpassed the 10-year eligibility period for earning the credits. Most of those facilities have since been repowered, and under IRS rules, qualifying repowered facilities are eligible for the available credits, for 10 years from the date they are returned to service. Refer to "Capital Expenditures" in Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about repowering and new wind- and solar-powered generation placed in-service. PTC's totaled 710 million, 574 million and 510 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding - 
 
 Income tax benefit for MidAmerican Funding increased 96 million, or 14 , for 2022 compared to 2021, and the effective tax rate was (454) for 2022 and (335) for 2021. The change in effective tax rates was due principally to the factors discussed for MidAmerican Energy. 

246 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 MidAmerican Energy - 
 
 Electric utility margin decreased 190 million, or 11 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to: 
 a 99 million increase in retail utility margin primarily due to 50 million from higher usage for certain industrial customers; 13 million from the favorable impact of weather; 19 million due to price impacts from changes in sales mix; 10 million, net of energy costs, from higher recoveries through bill riders (offset in operations and maintenance expense and income tax benefit) and 6 million from liquidated damages related to a wind-powered generation project. Retail customer volumes increased 5.8 ; and 
 a 93 million increase in wholesale utility margin due to higher margins per unit of 52 million, reflecting higher market prices, net of higher energy costs, and higher volumes of 42.7 ; partially offset by 
 a 2 million decrease in Multi-Value Projects ("MVP") transmission revenue. 
 Natural gas utility margin decreased 3 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to: 
 a 6 million decrease from higher refunds related to amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes arising from 2017 Tax Reform (offset in income tax benefit); 
 a 3 million decrease due to the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by price impacts from changes in sales mix; partially offset by 
 a 4 million increase in natural gas energy efficiency program revenue (offset in operations and maintenance expense); and 
 a 2 million increase in natural gas transportation margin, reflecting higher volumes. 
 Operations and maintenance increased 21 million, or 3 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due higher other generation operations and maintenance expenses of 7 million due to additional wind turbines and easements, higher energy efficiency program expense of 7 million (offset in operating revenue), higher natural gas distribution costs of 6 million and higher transmission operations costs from MISO of 3 million, partially offset by lower electric distribution costs of 11 million due to storm restoration costs in 2020. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 198 million, or 28 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 114 million from higher Iowa revenue sharing accruals, 25 million from a regulatory mechanism that provides customers the retail energy benefits of certain wind-powered generation projects and 59 million related to new and repowered wind-powered generating facilities and other plant placed in-service. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 7 million, or 5 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher wind turbine property taxes. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 2 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in a regulatory carrying charge and lower variable interest rates, partially offset by a higher average long-term debt balance. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed and equity funds decreased 8 million, or 13 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower construction work-in-progress balances related to wind-powered generation projects. 
 
 Other, net increased 1 million, or 2 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher cash surrender values of corporate-owned life insurance policies and lower non-service costs of postretirement employee benefit plans, partially offset by a gain from the contribution of land to a joint venture in 2020. 
 
 Income tax benefit increased 105 million, or 18 , for 2021 compared to 2020, and the effective tax rate was (308) for 2021 and (223) for 2020. The change in the effective tax rate was substantially due to an increase of 64 million in PTCs, state income tax impacts and lower pretax income in 2021. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding - 
 
 Income tax benefit for MidAmerican Funding increased 106 million, or 18 , for 2021 compared to 2020, and the effective tax rate was (335) for 2021 and (235) for 2020. The change in effective tax rates was due principally to the factors discussed for MidAmerican Energy. 
 
 247 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy's and MidAmerican Funding's total net liquidity were as follows (in millions): 
 MidAmerican Energy: Cash and cash equivalents 258 Credit facilities, maturing 2023 and 2025 1,505 Less: Tax-exempt bond support (370) Net credit facilities 1,135 MidAmerican Energy total net liquidity 1,393 MidAmerican Funding: MidAmerican Energy total net liquidity 1,393 Cash and cash equivalents 3 MHC, Inc. credit facility, maturing 2023 4 MidAmerican Funding total net liquidity 1,400 

Operating Activities 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net cash flows from operating activities were 2,174 million, 1,617 million and 1,543 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. MidAmerican Funding's net cash flows from operating activities were 2,161 million, 1,605 million and 1,536 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher utility margins for MidAmerican Energy's regulated electric and natural gas businesses, higher income tax receipts and lower payments to vendors. Higher utility margins are partially attributable to timing of the recovery of higher natural gas costs caused by the February 2021 polar vortex weather event. Cash flows from operating activities increased for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher income tax receipts, lower payments for the settlement of AROs and lower interest payments. 
 
 The timing of MidAmerican Energy's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net cash flows from investing activities were (1,867) million, (1,911) million and (1,826) million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. MidAmerican Funding's net cash flows from investing activities were (1,868) million, (1,912) million and (1,825) million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash flows from investing activities consist almost entirely of capital expenditures. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. Purchases and proceeds related to marketable securities primarily consist of activity within the Quad Cities Generating Station nuclear decommissioning trust, and other investment proceeds relates primarily to company-owned life insurance policies. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's net cash flows from financing activities were (278) million, 488 million and (2) million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. MidAmerican Funding's net cash flows from financing activities were (262) million, 501 million and 4 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022 MidAmerican Energy paid 275 million in dividends to its parent company, MHC, Inc. In July 2021, MidAmerican Energy issued 500 million of its 2.70 First Mortgage Bonds due August 2052. In 2022, MidAmerican Funding made a 69 million distribution to its sole member, BHE. MidAmerican Funding paid 189 million in 2022 and received 12 million and 5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, through its note payable with BHE. 
 
 248 

Debt Authorizations and Related Matters 
 
 Short-term Debt 
 
 MidAmerican Energy has authority from the FERC to issue, through April 2, 2024, commercial paper and bank notes aggregating 1.5 billion. MidAmerican Energy has a 1.5 billion unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2025. The credit facility, which supports MidAmerican Energy's commercial paper program and its variable-rate tax-exempt bond obligations and provides for the issuance of letters of credit, has a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a spread that varies based on MidAmerican Energy's credit ratings for senior unsecured long-term debt securities. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has a 5 million unsecured credit facility for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Long-term Debt and Preferred Stock 
 
 MidAmerican Energy currently has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue up to 3.25 billion of long-term debt securities and preferred stock through June 13, 2024. MidAmerican Energy has authorization from the FERC to issue, through June 30, 2023, long-term debt securities up to an aggregate of 2.0 billion and preferred stock up to an aggregate of 500 million. MidAmerican Energy has authorization from the ICC through May 25, 2025, to issue long-term debt securities up to an aggregate of 2.2 billion and preferred stock up to an aggregate of 500 million; through October 15, 2024, to issue 750 million of long-term debt securities for the purpose of refinancing 250 million of its 3.70 Senior notes due September 2023 and 500 million of its 2.40 Senior notes due October 2024; and through January 1, 2025, to issue 105 million of long-term debt securities for the purpose of refinancing three of its variable-rate tax-exempt bond series, including 57 million due in May 2023, 35 million due in October 2024 and 13 million due in January 2025. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's mortgage dated September 9, 2013, creates a lien on most of MidAmerican Energy's electric utility property within the state of Iowa, allowing the issuance of bonds based on a percentage of eligible utility property additions, bond credits arising from retirement of previously outstanding bonds or deposits of cash. As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy estimated it would be able to issue up to 9.3 billion of new first mortgage bonds under the mortgage. Any issuances are subject to market conditions, and amounts are further limited by regulatory authorizations and commitments, as well as any more restrictive requirements of covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements. MidAmerican Energy also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage on the basis of property additions, bond credits or deposits of cash. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding or one of its subsidiaries, including MidAmerican Energy, may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by MidAmerican Funding or one of its subsidiaries may be reissued or resold by MidAmerican Funding or one of its subsidiaries from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the issuing company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 

Future Uses of Cash 
 
 MidAmerican Energy and MidAmerican Funding have available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which MidAmerican Energy and MidAmerican Funding have access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including their credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 MidAmerican Energy has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 249 

MidAmerican Energy's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 Historical Forecast 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Wind generation 911 964 685 1,353 1,288 895 Electric distribution 273 257 311 296 250 259 Electric transmission 160 199 145 186 159 211 Solar generation 16 132 119 10 48 74 Other 476 360 609 606 404 352 Total 1,836 1,912 1,869 2,451 2,149 1,791 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's capital expenditures provided above consist of the following: 
 Wind generation includes the construction, acquisition, repowering and operation of wind-powered generating facilities in Iowa. 
 Construction and acquisition of wind-powered generating facilities totaled 72 million for 2022, 540 million for 2021 and 848 million for 2020. The timing and amount of forecast wind generation capital expenditures may be impacted by the outcome of MidAmerican Energy's Wind PRIME filing currently before the IUB. MidAmerican Energy placed in-service 294 MWs during 2021 and 729 MWs during 2020. All of these wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in 2021 and 2020 qualify for 100 of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa EAC until these generation assets are reflected in base rates. 
 Repowering of wind-powered generating facilities totaled 500 million for 2022, 354 million for 2021 and 37 million for 2020. Planned spending for repowering totals 20 million in 2023. MidAmerican Energy expects its repowered facilities to meet IRS guidelines for the re-establishment of PTCs for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. 
 Electric distribution includes expenditures for new facilities to meet retail demand growth and for replacement of existing facilities to maintain system reliability. 
 Electric transmission includes expenditures to meet retail demand growth, upgrades to accommodate third-party generator requirements and replacement of existing facilities to maintain system reliability. 
 Solar generation includes the construction of solar-powered generating facilities totaling 141 MWs of small- and utility-scale solar generation, all of which were placed in-service in 2022, with total spend of 119 million in 2022 and 132 million in 2021. MidAmerican Energy is pursuing additional opportunities for solar generation, including those in MidAmerican Energy's Wind PRIME filing currently before the IUB. 
 Remaining expenditures primarily relate to routine projects for other generation, natural gas distribution, technology, facilities and other operational needs to serve existing and expected demand. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 MidAmerican Energy and MidAmerican Funding have cash requirements that may affect their financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Notes 7 and 8), firm commitments (refer to Note 13) and construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7) and AROs (refer to Note 11). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy has cash requirements relating to interest payments of 5.6 billion on long-term debt, including 316 million due in 2023. Additionally, MidAmerican Funding has cash requirements relating to interest payments on its long-term debt of 109 million, including 17 million due in 2023. 
 
 250 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding MidAmerican Energy's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 
 
 Quad Cities Generating Station Operating Status 
 
 Constellation Energy Generation, LLC ("Constellation Energy"), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 ("Quad Cities Station") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25 ownership interest, receives financial support for continued operation of Quad Cities Station from the zero emission standard enacted by the Illinois legislature in December 2016. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs provide Constellation Energy additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy does not receive additional revenue from the subsidy. 
 
 The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. ("PJM") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule ("MOPR"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program like the Illinois zero emission standard, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fueled resources. 
 
 On December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expanded the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which became effective as of the PJM's capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year. While the FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC denied rehearing of that order on April 16, 2020. A number of parties, including Constellation Energy, have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. MidAmerican Energy cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 
 While this litigation is pending, the MOPR applied to Quad Cities Station in the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year in May 2021, which prevented Quad Cities Station from clearing in that capacity auction. 
 
 At the direction of the PJM Board of Managers, the PJM and its stakeholders developed further MOPR reforms to ensure that the capacity market rules respect and accommodate state resource preferences such as the ZEC programs. The PJM filed related tariff revisions with the FERC on July 30, 2021, and, on September 29, 2021, the PJM's proposed MOPR reforms became effective by operation of law. Under the new tariff provisions, the MOPR applied in the capacity auction for the 2023-2024 delivery year but did not restrict the offers of Quad Cities Station, which cleared in the capacity auction. Requests for rehearing of the FERC's notice establishing the effective date for the PJM's proposed market reforms were filed in October 2021 and denied by operation of law on November 4, 2021. Several parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 
 Assuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard, Constellation Energy no longer considers Quad Cities Station to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois zero emission standard does not operate as expected over its full term, Quad Cities Station would be at heightened risk for early retirement. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources like Quad Cities Station other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement ("FRR") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. Depending on the outcome of the proceedings related to the PJM MOPR, the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard may be undermined unless the PJM adopts further changes to the MOPR or Illinois implements an FRR mechanism, under which Quad Cities Station would be removed from the PJM's capacity auction. 
 
 251 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact MidAmerican Energy's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. MidAmerican Energy believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and MidAmerican Energy is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt securities of MidAmerican Energy are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of MidAmerican Energy's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy's credit ratings for its senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. As a result of the issuance of first mortgage bonds by MidAmerican Energy in September 2013, its then outstanding senior unsecured debt was equally and ratably secured with such first mortgage bonds. Refer to Note 8 of MidAmerican Energy's Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of MidAmerican Energy's first mortgage bonds. 
 
 MidAmerican Funding and MidAmerican Energy have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. MidAmerican Energy's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities. 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base MidAmerican Energy's collateral requirements on its credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance," or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in MidAmerican Energy's creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy would have been required to post 128 million of additional collateral. MidAmerican Energy's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors. 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where MidAmerican Energy operates have not had a significant impact on its financial results. MidAmerican Energy operates under cost-of-service based rate-setting structures administered by various state commissions and the FERC. Under these rate-setting structures, MidAmerican Energy is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation. MidAmerican Energy attempts to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, inflation's impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs, and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 
 
 252 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by MidAmerican Energy's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with MidAmerican Energy's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 MidAmerican Energy prepares its financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, MidAmerican Energy defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition, that could limit MidAmerican Energy's ability to recover its costs. MidAmerican Energy believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate, and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at both the federal and state levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be written off to net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 550 million and total regulatory liabilities were 1,119 million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 
 MidAmerican Funding's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, includes goodwill from the acquisition of MHC totaling 1.3 billion. Goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit. MidAmerican Funding evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31, 2022. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2022. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. MidAmerican Funding uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, MidAmerican Funding incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 MidAmerican Energy sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of the employees of BHE and its domestic energy subsidiaries other than PacifiCorp and NV Energy Inc. MidAmerican Energy recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy recognized a net liability totaling 99 million for the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2022, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in regulatory assets totaled 47 million. 
 
 253 

The expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including, but not limited to, discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. MidAmerican Energy believes that the key assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about MidAmerican Energy's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to cash flows over the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced. 
 
 In establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, MidAmerican Energy utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. MidAmerican Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00 by 2028 at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant. 
 
 The key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Financial Statements of the total plan before allocations to affiliates would be as follows (in millions): 
 Other Postretirement Pension Plans Benefit Plans +0.5 -0.5 +0.5 -0.5 Effect on December 31, 2022 Benefit Obligations: Discount rate (22) 24 (9) 10 Effect on 2022 Periodic Cost: Discount rate 1 (1) Expected rate of return on plan assets (3) 3 (1) 1 
 
 A variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, plan changes and MidAmerican Energy's funding policy for each plan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining MidAmerican Funding's and MidAmerican Energy's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by MidAmerican Energy's various regulatory commissions. MidAmerican Funding's and MidAmerican Energy's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. MidAmerican Funding and MidAmerican Energy recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of their federal, state and local tax examinations is uncertain, each company believes it has made adequate provisions for its income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.

It is probable that MidAmerican Energy will either refund to, or recover from its customers in certain state jurisdiction income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences, and other various differences. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 72 million and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue 
 
 Revenue from electric and natural gas customers is recognized as electricity or natural gas is delivered or services are provided. The determination of customer billings is based on a systematic reading of customer meters and applicable rates. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was 102 million as of December 31, 2022. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled revenue include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month, and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. MidAmerican Energy's significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which it transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with MidAmerican Energy's business activities. MidAmerican Energy has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding MidAmerican Energy's contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. MidAmerican Energy is principally exposed to electricity, natural gas, coal and fuel oil commodity price risk as it has an obligation to serve retail customer load in its regulated service territory. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather; market liquidity; generating facility availability; customer usage; storage; and transmission and transportation constraints. Commodity price risk for MidAmerican Energy's regulated retail electricity and natural gas operations is significantly mitigated by the inclusion of energy costs in energy cost rider mechanisms, which permit the current recovery of such costs from its retail customers. MidAmerican Energy uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements to mitigate price volatility on behalf of its customers. MidAmerican Energy does not engage in a material amount of proprietary trading activities. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 MidAmerican Energy and MidAmerican Funding are exposed to interest rate risk on their outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. MidAmerican Energy and MidAmerican Funding manage interest rate risk by limiting their exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, the fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose MidAmerican Energy or MidAmerican Funding to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if MidAmerican Energy or MidAmerican Funding were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. MidAmerican Energy or MidAmerican Funding may from time to time enter into interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps or locks, to mitigate their exposure to interest rate risk. The nature and amount of their short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Notes 7, 8 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of MidAmerican Energy's and MidAmerican Funding's short- and long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, MidAmerican Energy had short- and long-term variable-rate obligations totaling 370 million that expose MidAmerican Energy to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. The market risk related to MidAmerican Energy's variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2022, is not hedged. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on MidAmerican Energy's annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 255 

Credit Risk 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy participates in the RTO markets and has indirect credit exposure related to other participants, although RTO credit policies are designed to limit exposure to credit losses from individual participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent MidAmerican Energy's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, MidAmerican Energy analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty, and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, MidAmerican Energy enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, MidAmerican Energy exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 Substantially all of MidAmerican Energy's electric wholesale sales revenue results from participation in RTOs, including the MISO and the PJM. MidAmerican Energy's share of historical losses from defaults by other RTO market participants has not been material. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy's aggregate direct credit exposure from electric wholesale marketing counterparties was not material.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 MidAmerican Energy Company 
 Des Moines, Iowa 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MidAmerican Energy Company ("MidAmerican Energy") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MidAmerican Energy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of MidAmerican Energy's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on MidAmerican Energy's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to MidAmerican Energy in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. MidAmerican Energy is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of MidAmerican Energy's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 MidAmerican Energy is subject to rate regulation by state public service commissions as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas companies in the respective service territories where MidAmerican Energy operates. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 258 

Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow MidAmerican Energy an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While MidAmerican Energy has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit MidAmerican Energy's ability to recover their costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated MidAmerican Energy's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected MidAmerican Energy's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.

 Natural Gas Purchased for Resale 
 
 In February 2021, severe cold weather over the central U.S. caused disruptions in natural gas supply from the southern part of the U.S. These disruptions, combined with increased demand, resulted in historically high prices for natural gas purchased for resale to MidAmerican Energy's retail customers and caused an approximate million increase in natural gas costs above those normally expected. These increased costs are reflected in cost of natural gas purchased for resale and other on the Statement of Operations and their recovery through the Purchased Gas Adjustment Clause is reflected in regulated natural gas and other revenue. 
 
 To mitigate the impact to MidAmerican Energy's customers, the IUB ordered the recovery of these higher costs to be applied to customer bills over the period April 2021 through April 2022 based on a customer's monthly natural gas usage. The unbilled portion of these costs as of December 31, 2021, is reflected in trade receivables, net on the Balance Sheet.

 As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy has a billion unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2025 with an unlimited number of maturity extension options, subject to lender consent. The credit facility, which supports MidAmerican Energy's commercial paper program and its variable-rate tax-exempt bond obligations and provides for the issuance of letters of credit, has a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a base rate, at MidAmerican Energy's option, plus a spread that varies based on MidAmerican Energy's credit ratings for senior unsecured long-term debt securities. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has a million unsecured credit facility, which expires June 2023 and has a variable interest rate based on SOFR, plus a spread. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding of as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The billion credit facility requires that MidAmerican Energy's ratio of consolidated debt, including current maturities, to total capitalization not exceed to 1.0 as of the last day of any quarter. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy was in compliance with the covenants of its credit facilities. MidAmerican Energy has authority from the FERC to issue commercial paper and bank notes aggregating billion through April 2, 2024. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, MidAmerican Energy had million and million, respectively, of fully available letters of credit issued under committed arrangements outside of its credit facility in support of certain transactions required by third parties that generally have provisions that automatically extend the annual expiration dates for an additional year unless the issuing bank elects not to renew a letter of credit prior to the expiration date.

 Pursuant to MidAmerican Energy's mortgage dated September 9, 2013, MidAmerican Energy's first mortgage bonds, currently and from time to time outstanding, are secured by a first mortgage lien on substantially all of its electric generating, transmission and distribution property within the state of Iowa, subject to certain exceptions and permitted encumbrances. Approximately billion of MidAmerican Energy's eligible property, based on original cost, was subject to the lien of the mortgage as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy's senior notes outstanding are equally and ratably secured with the first mortgage bonds as required by the indentures under which the senior notes were issued. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy's variable-rate tax-exempt bond obligations bear interest at rates that are periodically established through remarketing of the bonds in the short-term tax-exempt market. MidAmerican Energy, at its option, may change the mode of interest calculation for these bonds by selecting from among several floating or fixed rate alternatives. The interest rates shown in the table above are the weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. MidAmerican Energy maintains revolving credit facility agreements to provide liquidity for holders of these issues. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy's obligations associated with the million and million variable rate, tax-exempt bond obligations due 2046 and 2047, respectively, are secured by an equal amount of first mortgage bonds pursuant to MidAmerican Energy's mortgage dated September 9, 2013, as supplemented and amended. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy was in compliance with all of its applicable long-term debt covenants. 
 
 In March 1999, MidAmerican Energy committed to the IUB to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain an investment grade rating on its long-term debt and to maintain its common equity level above of total capitalization unless circumstances beyond its control result in the common equity level decreasing to below of total capitalization. MidAmerican Energy must seek the approval from the IUB of a reasonable utility capital structure if MidAmerican Energy's common equity level decreases below of total capitalization, unless the decrease is beyond the control of MidAmerican Energy. MidAmerican Energy is also required to seek the approval of the IUB if MidAmerican Energy's equity level decreases to below , even if the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the control of MidAmerican Energy. As of December 31, 2022, MidAmerican Energy's common equity ratio was computed on a basis consistent with its commitment. As a result of its regulatory commitment to maintain its common equity level above certain thresholds, MidAmerican Energy could dividend billion as of December 31, 2022, without falling below .

 The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has closed or effectively settled its examination of MidAmerican Energy's income tax returns through December 31, 2013. The statute of limitations for MidAmerican Energy's income tax returns have expired for certain states through December 31, 2011, and for other states through December 31, 2018, except for the impact of any federal audit adjustments. The closure of examinations, or the expiration of the statute of limitations, for state filings may not preclude the state from adjusting the state net operating loss carryforward utilized in a year for which the statute of limitations is not closed.

The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits, other than applicable interest and penalties, would not affect MidAmerican Energy's effective income tax rate.

 million and a settlement gain of million, respectively, for previously unrecognized losses and gains as a result of excess lump sum distributions over the defined threshold. In 2022, the defined benefit pension plan recorded a curtailment gain of million as a result of certain plan amendments. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy also sponsors certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits covering substantially all retired employees of BHE and its domestic energy subsidiaries other than PacifiCorp and NV Energy, Inc. Under the plans, a majority of all employees of the participating companies may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age. New employees are not eligible for benefits under the plans. MidAmerican Energy has been allowed to recover accrued pension and other postretirement benefit costs in its electric and gas service rates.

 For purposes of calculating the expected return on pension plan assets, a market-related value is used. The market-related value of plan assets is calculated by spreading the difference between expected and actual investment returns on equity investments over a five-year period beginning after the first year in which they occur. 
 
 MidAmerican Energy bills to and is reimbursed currently for affiliates' share of the net periodic benefit costs from all plans in which such affiliates participate. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, MidAmerican Energy's share of the pension net periodic benefit (credit) cost was ) million, ) million and ) million, respectively. MidAmerican Energy's share of the other postretirement net periodic benefit (credit) cost in 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled ) million, million and ) million, respectively.

 For level 1 investments, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. For level 2 investments, the fair value is determined using pricing models based on observable market inputs. Shares of mutual funds not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, private equity limited partnership interests, common and commingled trust funds and investment entities are reported at fair value based on the net asset value per unit, which is used for expedience purposes. A fund's net asset value is based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the fund less its liabilities. 
 
 Defined Contribution Plan 
 
 MidAmerican Energy sponsors a defined contribution plan ("401(k) plan") covering substantially all employees. MidAmerican Energy's matching contributions are based on each participant's level of contribution, and certain participants receive contributions based on eligible pretax annual compensation. Contributions cannot exceed the maximum allowable for tax purposes. Certain participants now receive enhanced benefits in the 401(k) plan and no longer accrue benefits in the noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. MidAmerican Energy's contributions to the plan were million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Managers and Member of 
 MidAmerican Funding, LLC 
 Des Moines, Iowa 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MidAmerican Funding, LLC and subsidiaries ("MidAmerican Funding") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in member's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MidAmerican Funding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of MidAmerican Funding's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on MidAmerican Funding's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to MidAmerican Funding in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. MidAmerican Funding is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of MidAmerican Funding's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 294 

Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 MidAmerican Funding is subject to rate regulation by state public service commissions as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas companies in the respective service territories where MidAmerican Funding operates. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow MidAmerican Funding an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While MidAmerican Funding has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit MidAmerican Funding's ability to recover their costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated MidAmerican Funding's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected MidAmerican Funding's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.

 reportable operating segments: regulated electric and regulated natural gas. The regulated electric segment derives most of its revenue from regulated retail sales of electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and from wholesale sales. The regulated natural gas segment derives most of its revenue from regulated retail sales of natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and also obtains revenue by transporting natural gas owned by others through its distribution system. Pricing for regulated electric and regulated natural gas sales are established separately by regulatory agencies; therefore, management also reviews each segment separately to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and in evaluating performance. Common operating costs, interest income, interest expense and income tax expense are allocated to each segment based on certain factors, which primarily relate to the nature of the cost.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Nevada Power during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Nevada Power's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Nevada Power's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 298 million, a decrease of 5 million, or 2 , compared to 2021, primarily due to lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and higher pension expense, higher interest expense, primarily due to higher long-term debt, higher depreciation and amortization, mainly due to higher plant placed in-service, higher property and other taxes, mainly due to a decrease in the amount of abatements available, higher operations and maintenance expenses, mainly due to higher earnings sharing and higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income, primarily from carrying charges on regulatory balances, higher capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction from higher construction work-in-progress and higher utility margin. Utility margin increased primarily due to higher regulatory-related revenue deferrals and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by unfavorable price impacts from changes in sales mix, lower transmission and wholesale revenue and lower other retail revenue. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and favorable changes in customer usage, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Energy generated decreased 4 for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower natural gas-fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 65 and purchased electricity volumes increased 14 . 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 303 million, an increase of 8 million, or 3 , compared to 2020, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to lower net regulatory instructed deferrals and amortizations, lower earnings sharing and lower plant operations and maintenance expenses, lower income tax expense primarily due to the recognition of amortization of excess deferred income taxes following regulatory approval effective January 2021, 10 million of higher interest and dividend income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances, lower interest expense and higher other, net. These increases are offset by lower utility margin, primarily due to lower retail rates from the 2020 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2021, lower revenue recognized due to a favorable regulatory decision in 2020 and an adjustment to regulatory-related revenue deferrals, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers and higher transmission revenue, and higher depreciation and amortization, mainly due to regulatory amortizations approved in the 2020 regulatory rate review effective January 2021 and higher plant placed in-service. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 3.5 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and favorable changes in customer usage patterns, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. Energy generated increased 1 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas-fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes decreased 5 and purchased electricity volumes increased 10 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Nevada Power's cost of fuel and energy is generally recovered from its retail customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and, as a result, changes in Nevada Power's expenses included in regulatory recovery mechanisms result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes utility margin more appropriately and concisely explains profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of fuel and energy separately. Management believes the presentation of utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 
 Utility margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Utility margin increased 3 million for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 11 million of higher regulatory-related revenue deferrals and 
 4 million of higher electric retail utility margin due to higher retail customer volumes, offset by unfavorable price impacts from changes in sales mix. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and favorable changes in customer usage, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather. 
 The increase in utility margin was partially offset by: 
 6 million of lower energy efficiency program rates (offset in operations and maintenance expense); 
 3 million of lower transmission and wholesale revenue; and 
 3 million due to lower other retail revenue. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 2 million, or 1 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher earnings sharing and higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by lower energy efficiency program costs (offset in operating revenue). 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 11 million, or 3 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher plant placed in-service. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 5 million, or 10 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the amount of abatements available. 
 
 Interest expense increased 12 million, or 8 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher long-term debt. 
 
 Capitalized interest increased 5 million for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher construction work-in-progress. 
 
 Allowance for equity funds increased 4 million, or 57 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher construction work-in-progress. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 27 million for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 Other, net decreased 15 million, or 83 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and higher pension expense. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 Utility margin increased 18 million for 2021 compared to 2020 due to: 
 the 120 million one-time bill credit returned to customers in 2020 as a result of the Nevada Power regulatory rate review stipulation (" 120 million bill credit") (offset in operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense) and 
 5 million of higher transmission revenue. 
 The increase in utility margin was partially offset by: 
 66 million of lower retail electric utility margin primarily due to lower retail rates due to the 2020 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2021, offset by higher retail customer volumes. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 3.5 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and favorable changes in customer usage patterns, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather; 
 21 million of lower revenue recognized due to a favorable regulatory decision in 2020; 
 10 million due to lower energy efficiency program rates (offset in operations and maintenance expense); 
 6 million due to an adjustment to regulatory-related revenue deferrals; and 
 4 million due to a regulatory amortization of an impact fee that ended December 2020. 
 313 

Operations and maintenance increased 2 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to regulatory liability amortization in 2020 to satisfy a portion of the 120 million bill credit of 94 million (offset in operating revenue), partially offset by lower net regulatory instructed deferrals and amortizations of 46 million, mainly relating to deferrals in 2020 of the non-labor cost savings from the Navajo generating station retirement which was approved for amortization in the 2020 regulatory rate review with new rates effective January 2021, and timing of the regulatory impacts for the ON Line lease cost reallocation, lower earnings sharing, lower energy efficiency program costs (offset in operating revenue) and lower plant operations and maintenance expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 45 million, or 12 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to regulatory amortizations approved in the 2020 regulatory rate review effective January 2021 and higher plant placed in-service. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 9 million, or 6 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower carrying charges on regulatory balances of 6 million and lower interest expense on long-term debt. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 10 million for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher interest income, mainly 
 from carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 Other, net increased 9 million for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower pension expense of 6 million and higher cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 10 million, or 21 , for 2021 compared to 2020. The effective tax rate was 11 in 2021 and 14 in 2020 and decreased primarily due to the recognition of amortization of excess deferred income taxes following regulatory approval effective January 2021, partially offset by the one-time recognition in 2020 of amortization of excess deferred income taxes to satisfy a portion of the 120 million bill credit (offset in operating revenue). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Nevada Power's total net liquidity was 443 million as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 43 Credit facilities (1) 
 400 Total net liquidity 443 Credit facilities: Maturity dates 2025 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for further discussion regarding Nevada Power's credit facility. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 355 million and 505 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher payments related to fuel and energy costs and the timing of payments for operating costs, partially offset by higher collections from customers and lower payments for income taxes. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 505 million and 467 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher collections from customers, timing of payments for operating costs, increased collections of customer advances and lower inventory purchases, partially offset by the timing of payments for fuel and energy costs and higher payments for income taxes. 
 
 The timing of Nevada Power's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 314 

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (862) million and (447) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and the issuance of an affiliate note receivable. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (447) million and (429) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 522 million and (49) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, lower dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc. and higher contributions from NV Energy, Inc., partially offset by higher repayments of short-term debt. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (49) million and (27) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and higher dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc., partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt and higher net proceeds from short-term debt. 
 
 Ability to Issue Debt 
 
 Nevada Power currently has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue up to 2.6 billion of general and refunding mortgage securities through November 1, 2025. Additionally, Nevada Power's ability to issue debt is primarily impacted by its financing authority from the PUCN. As of December 31, 2022, Nevada Power has financing authority from the PUCN consisting of the ability to issue long-term and short-term debt securities so long as the total amount of debt outstanding (excluding borrowings under Nevada Power's 400 million secured credit facility) does not exceed 3.8 billion and to issue common and preferred stock so long as the total amounts outstanding do not exceed 4.1 billion and 800 million, respectively, as measured at the end of each calendar quarter. Nevada Power's revolving credit facility contains a financial maintenance covenant which Nevada Power was in compliance with as of December 31, 2022. In addition, certain financing agreements contain covenants which are currently suspended as Nevada Power's senior secured debt is rated investment grade. However, if Nevada Power's senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either Moody's Investor Service or Standard Poor's, Nevada Power would be subject to limitations under these covenants. 
 
 Ability to Issue General and Refunding Mortgage Securities 
 
 To the extent Nevada Power has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the PUCN, Nevada Power's ability to issue secured debt is limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under Nevada Power's indenture. 
 
 Nevada Power's indenture creates a lien on substantially all of Nevada Power's properties in Nevada. As of December 31, 2022, 9.8 billion of Nevada Power's assets were pledged. Nevada Power had the capacity to issue 3.3 billion of additional general and refunding mortgage securities as of December 31, 2022, determined on the basis of 70 of net utility property additions. Property additions include plant-in-service and specific assets in construction work-in-progress. The amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in construction work-in-progress. Nevada Power also has the ability to release property from the lien of Nevada Power's indenture on the basis of net property additions, cash or retired bonds. To the extent Nevada Power releases property from the lien of Nevada Power's indenture, it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 In October 2022, Nevada Power issued 400 million of 5.90 General and Refunding Mortgage bonds, Series GG, due 2053. The net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under its existing revolving credit facility, to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 315 

In January 2022, Nevada Power entered into a 300 million secured delayed draw term loan facility maturing in January 2024. Amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at variable rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or a base rate, at Nevada Power's option, plus a pricing margin. In January 2022, Nevada Power borrowed 200 million under the facility at an initial interest rate of 0.55 . In May 2022, Nevada Power drew the remaining 100 million available under the facility at an initial interest rate of 1.24 . Nevada Power used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its existing secured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Nevada Power has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the use of secured revolving credit facilities, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which Nevada Power has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including Nevada Power's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk associated with Nevada Power and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customers' rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Prudently incurred expenditures for compliance-related items such as pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs are generally incorporated into Nevada Power's regulated retail rates. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisition of existing assets.

 Nevada Power received PUCN approval through its recent IRP filings for an increase in solar generation and electric transmission and has included estimates from its IRP filings in its forecast capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. These estimates are likely to change as a result of the RFP process. Nevada Power's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects primarily relate to the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. In this project, the company has received approval from the PUCN to build a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. Operating expenditures consist of routine expenditures for transmission and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 316 

Solar generation includes a growth project consisting of a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2023. 
 Electric battery storage includes two growth projects consisting of a 100-MW battery energy storage system co-located with a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility that will be developed in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2023. The second project is a 220-MW grid-tied battery energy storage system that will be developed on the site of the retired Reid Gardner generating station in Clark County, Nevada. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2023. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of turbine upgrades at several generating facilities, routine expenditures for generation, other operating projects and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Nevada Power has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Notes 7 and 8), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 5), purchased electricity contracts (refer to Note 14), fuel contracts (refer to Note 14), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7 and Note 14) and AROs (refer to Note 11). Refer to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Nevada Power has cash requirements relating to interest payments of 2.4 billion on long-term debt, including 152 million due in 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Nevada Power is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding Nevada Power's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Nevada Power is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact Nevada Power's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Nevada Power believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Nevada Power is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt of Nevada Power is rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of Nevada Power's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. 
 
 Nevada Power has no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. Nevada Power's secured revolving credit facility does not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon its availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facility are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities. 
 
 317 

In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance," or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, the applicable credit ratings obtained from recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2022, Nevada Power would have been required to post 51 million of additional collateral. Nevada Power's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors. 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where Nevada Power operates has not had a significant impact on Nevada Power's consolidated financial results. Nevada Power operates under a cost-of-service based rate-setting structure administered by the PUCN and the FERC. Under this rate-setting structure, Nevada Power is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation after Nevada Power experiences cost increases. Fuel and purchase power costs are recovered through a balancing account, minimizing the impact of inflation related to these costs. Nevada Power attempts to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations through the use of periodic rate adjustments for fuel and energy costs, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by Nevada Power's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with Nevada Power's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Nevada Power's Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 Nevada Power prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, Nevada Power defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 
 Nevada Power continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit Nevada Power's ability to recover its costs. Nevada Power believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at both the federal and state levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be written off to net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 1.3 billion and total regulatory liabilities were 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Nevada Power's Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for additional information regarding Nevada Power's regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 318 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Nevada Power evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment was used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. 
 
 The estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of an asset, for the purposes of impairment analysis, requires the exercise of judgment. Circumstances that could significantly alter the calculation of fair value or the recoverable amount of an asset may include significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset, the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect Nevada Power's results of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining Nevada Power's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by Nevada Power's various regulatory commissions. Nevada Power's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. Nevada Power recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of Nevada Power's federal, state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, Nevada Power believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on Nevada Power's consolidated financial results. Refer to Nevada Power's Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Nevada Power's income taxes. 
 
 It is probable that Nevada Power will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property related basis differences and other various differences on to its customers. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 560 million and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue 
 
 Revenue is recognized as electricity is delivered or services are provided. The determination of customer billings is based on a systematic reading of meters. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since their last billing is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was 143 million as of December 31, 2022. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Estimates are reversed in the following month when actual revenue is recorded. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Nevada Power's Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. Nevada Power's significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which Nevada Power transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with Nevada Power's business activities. Nevada Power has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Nevada Power's contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 
 319 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Nevada Power is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. Nevada Power is principally exposed to electricity and natural gas market fluctuations primarily through Nevada Power's obligation to serve retail customer load in its regulated service territory. Nevada Power's load and generating facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposures to commodity prices consist mainly of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity and wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage, and transmission and transportation constraints. The actual cost of fuel and purchased power is recoverable through the deferred energy mechanism. Interest rate risk exists on variable-rate debt and future debt issuances. Nevada Power does not engage in proprietary trading activities. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, Nevada Power uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. Nevada Power does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. Nevada Power's exposure to commodity price risk is generally limited by its ability to include commodity costs in regulated rates through its deferred energy mechanism, which is subject to disallowance and regulatory lag that occurs between the time the costs are incurred and when the costs are included in regulated rates, as well as the impact of any customer sharing resulting from cost adjustment mechanisms. 
 
 The table that follows summarizes Nevada Power's price risk on commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10 increase and 10 decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worse case scenarios (dollars in millions). 
 
 Fair Value - Estimated Fair Value after Net Asset Hypothetical Change in Price (Liability) 10 increase 10 decrease As of December 31, 2022: Total commodity derivative contracts (52) (23) (81) As of December 31, 2021: Total commodity derivative contracts (113) (93) (133) 
 
 Nevada Power's commodity derivative contracts not designated as hedging contracts are recoverable from customers in regulated rates and therefore, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on commodity derivative contracts do not expose Nevada Power to earnings volatility. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a net regulatory asset of 52 million and 113 million, respectively, was recorded related to the net derivative liability of 52 million and 113 million, respectively. The settled cost of these commodity derivative contracts is generally included in regulated rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Nevada Power is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. Nevada Power manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, Nevada Power's fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose Nevada Power to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Nevada Power were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. The nature and amount of Nevada Power's short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of Nevada Power's short- and long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Nevada Power had short- and long-term variable-rate obligations totaling 300 million and 180 million, respectively, that expose Nevada Power to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on Nevada Power's annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 320 

Credit Risk 
 
 Nevada Power is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Nevada Power's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Nevada Power analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, Nevada Power enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtain third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, Nevada Power exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Nevada Power's aggregate credit exposure from energy related transactions were not material, based on settlement and mark-to-market exposures, net of collateral.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 Nevada Power Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nevada Power Company and subsidiaries ("Nevada Power") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Nevada Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Nevada Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Nevada Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Nevada Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Nevada Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Nevada Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Nevada Power is subject to rate regulation by a state public service commission as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas companies in the respective service territories where Nevada Power operates. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 323 

Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow Nevada Power an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While Nevada Power Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit Nevada Power's ability to recover its costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated Nevada Power's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected Nevada Power's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.

 Nevada Power's lease obligation primarily consists of a transmission line, One Nevada Transmission Line ("ON Line"), which was placed in-service on December 31, 2013. Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific, collectively the ("Nevada Utilities"), entered into a long-term transmission use agreement, in which the Nevada Utilities have a interest and Great Basin Transmission South, LLC has a interest. The Nevada Utilities' share of the long-term transmission use agreement and ownership interest is split at for Nevada Power and for Sierra Pacific, previously split for Nevada Power and for Sierra Pacific. In December 2019, the PUCN ordered the Nevada Utilities to complete the necessary procedures to change the ownership split to for Nevada Power and for Sierra Pacific, effective January 1, 2020. In August 2020, the FERC approved the amended agreement between the Nevada Utilities and Great Basin Transmission, LLC that reallocated the PUCN-approved ownership percentage change from Nevada Power to Sierra Pacific.

Deferred Energy 
 
 Nevada statutes permit regulated utilities to adopt deferred energy accounting procedures. The intent of these procedures is to ease the effect on customers of fluctuations in the cost of purchased natural gas, fuel and electricity and are subject to annual prudency review by the PUCN. Under deferred energy accounting, to the extent actual fuel and purchased power costs exceed fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates that excess is not recorded as a current expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations but rather is deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and would be included in the table above as deferred energy costs. Conversely, a regulatory liability is recorded to the extent fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates exceed actual fuel and purchased power costs and is included in the table above as deferred energy costs. These excess amounts are reflected in quarterly adjustments to rates and recorded as cost of fuel, energy and capacity in future time periods.

 In 2008, Nevada Power signed an administrative order of consent as owner and operator of Reid Gardner Generating Station Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and as co-owner and operating agent of Unit No. 4. Based on the administrative order of consent, Nevada Power recorded estimated AROs and capital remediation costs. However, actual costs of work under the administrative order of consent may vary significantly once the scope of work is defined and additional site characterization has been completed. In connection with the termination of the co-ownership arrangement, effective October 22, 2013, between Nevada Power and California Department of Water Resources ("CDWR") for the Reid Gardner Generating Station Unit No. 4, Nevada Power and CDWR entered into a cost-sharing agreement that sets forth how the parties will jointly share in costs associated with all investigation, characterization and, if necessary, remedial activities as required under the administrative order of consent. 
 
 Certain of Nevada Power's decommissioning and reclamation obligations relate to jointly-owned facilities, and as such, Nevada Power is committed to pay a proportionate share of the decommissioning or reclamation costs. In the event of a default by any of the other joint participants, the respective subsidiary may be obligated to absorb, directly or by paying additional sums to the entity, a proportionate share of the defaulting party's liability. Management has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets specified in land leases for Nevada Power's jointly-owned Navajo Generating Station, retired in November 2019, and the Higgins Generating Station. Provisions of the lease require the lessees to remove the facilities upon request of the lessors at the expiration of the leases. Nevada Power's estimated share of the decommissioning and reclamation obligations are primarily recorded as ARO liabilities in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Credit Risk 
 
 Nevada Power is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Nevada Power's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Nevada Power analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, Nevada Power enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtain third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, Nevada Power exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement.

 Nevada Power's investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. 
 
 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which Nevada Power transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, Nevada Power uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent Nevada Power's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. Nevada Power bases its forward price curves upon internally developed models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to markets that are not active. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, Nevada Power uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The model incorporates a mid-market pricing convention (the mid point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The determination of the fair value for derivative contracts not only includes counterparty risk, but also the impact of Nevada Power's nonperformance risk on its liabilities, which as of December 31, 2022, had an immaterial impact to the fair value of its derivative contracts. As such, Nevada Power considers its derivative contracts to be valued using Level 3 inputs.

 Senate Bill 123 
 
 In June 2013, the Nevada State Legislature passed Senate Bill 123 ("SB 123"), which included the retirement of coal plants and replacing the capacity with renewable facilities and other generating facilities. In May 2014, Nevada Power filed its Emissions Reduction and Capacity Replacement Plan ("ERCR Plan") in compliance with SB 123. In July 2015, Nevada Power filed an amendment to its ERCR Plan with the PUCN which was approved in September 2015. In June 2015, the Nevada State Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 498, which modified the capacity replacement components of SB 123. 
 
 In compliance with SB 123, Nevada Power retired 255 MWs of coal-fueled generation in 2019 in addition to the 557 MWs of coal-fueled generation retired in 2017.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the financial condition and results of operations of Sierra Pacific during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Sierra Pacific's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Sierra Pacific's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 118 million, a decrease of 6 million, or 5 , compared to 2021, primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses, mainly due to higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, lower other, net, mainly due to higher pension expense and lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, higher depreciation and amortization, primarily due to higher plant in-service, higher interest expense mainly due to higher long-term debt, partially offset by higher electric utility margin and higher interest and dividend income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher transmission and wholesale revenue, higher customer volumes and higher regulatory-related revenue deferrals, partially offset by unfavorable price impacts from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 2.8 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather and unfavorable changes in customer usage. Energy generated decreased 13 for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower natural gas- and coal-fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 13 and purchased electricity volumes decreased 5 . 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 124 million, an increase of 13 million, or 12 , compared to 2020, primarily due to higher interest and dividend income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances, higher electric utility margin, mainly from price impacts from changes in sales mix and an increase in the average number of customer, primarily from the residential customer class, partially offset by lower revenue recognized due to a favorable regulatory decision and an adjustment to regulatory-related revenue deferrals, higher other, net, mainly due to lower pension expense and higher cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, higher allowance for equity funds, mainly due to higher construction work-in-progress, higher natural gas utility margin, mainly due to higher commercial usage, and lower interest expense, mainly due to lower carrying charges on regulatory balances, partially offset by higher income tax expense primarily due to higher pretax income, higher depreciation and amortization, mainly from regulatory amortizations and higher plant in-service, and higher operations and maintenance expenses, mainly due to higher plant operations and maintenance expenses and higher legal expenses, offset by lower earnings sharing. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 2.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, favorable changes in customer usage patterns and the favorable impact of weather. Energy generated decreased 2 for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower natural gas-fueled generation, partially offset by higher coal-fueled generation. Wholesale electricity sales volumes increased 20 and purchased electricity volumes increased 4 . 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 
 Management utilizes various key financial measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures such as, electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin, to help evaluate results of operations. Electric utility margin is calculated as electric operating revenue less cost of fuel and energy while natural gas utility margin is calculated as natural gas operating revenue less cost of natural gas purchased for resale, which are captions presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Sierra Pacific's cost of fuel and energy and cost of natural gas purchased for resale are generally recovered from its retail customers through regulatory recovery mechanisms and, as a result, changes in Sierra Pacific's expenses included in regulatory recovery mechanisms result in comparable changes to revenue. As such, management believes electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin more appropriately and concisely explains profitability rather than a discussion of revenue and cost of sales separately. Management believes the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin provides meaningful and valuable insight into the information management considers important to running the business and a measure of comparability to others in the industry. 
 350 

Electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of utility margin to operating income for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Electric utility margin increased 29 million, or 7 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 15 million of higher ON Line temporary rider (offset in operations and maintenance expense) for the recovery of deferred costs for ON Line due to the regulatory-directed reallocation of costs between Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific; 
 9 million of higher transmission and wholesale revenue; 
 4 million of higher regulatory-related revenue deferrals; and 
 1 million of higher electric retail utility margin due to higher customer volumes, offset by unfavorable price impacts from changes in sales mix. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 2.8 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, offset by the unfavorable impact of weather and unfavorable changes in customer usage. 
 The increase in electric utility margin was offset by: 
 2 million in lower energy efficiency program rates (offset in operations and maintenance expense). 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 26 million, or 16 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher regulatory-approved cost recovery for the ON Line reallocation of 15 million (offset in operating revenue) and higher plant operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by lower energy efficiency program costs (offset in operating revenue). 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 6 million, or 4 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher plant in-service. 
 
 Interest expense increased 4 million, or 7 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest rates and debt. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 9 million for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 Other, net decreased 9 million, or 82 , for 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher pension expense and lower cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies. 
 353 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 Electric utility margin increased 4 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to: 
 10 million of higher electric retail utility margin primarily due to higher retail customer volumes. Retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 2.9 primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, favorable changes in customer usage patterns and the favorable impact of weather, and 
 3 million of higher transmission and wholesale revenue. 
 The increase in electric utility margin was offset by: 
 3 million in lower revenue recognized due to a favorable regulatory decision in 2020; 
 3 million due to an adjustment to regulatory-related revenue deferrals; and 
 2 million due to lower energy efficiency program rates (offset in operations and maintenance expense). 
 
 Natural gas utility margin increased 2 million, or 4 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to favorable changes in customer usage patterns. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 1 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher plant operations and maintenance expenses and higher legal expenses, offset by lower earnings sharing and lower energy efficiency program costs (offset in operating revenue). 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 2 million, or 1 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to regulatory amortizations and higher plant in-service. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 2 million, or 4 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower carrying charges on regulatory 
 balances. 
 
 Allowance for equity funds increased 3 million, or 75 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher construction work-in-progress. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 5 million for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher interest income, mainly from carrying charges on regulatory balances. 
 
 Other, net increased 4 million, or 57 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower pension expense and higher cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 3 million, or 20 , for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher pretax income. The effective tax rate was 13 in 2021 and 12 in 2020. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific's total net liquidity was 299 million as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 49 Credit facilities (1) 
 250 Total net liquidity 299 Credit facilities: Maturity dates 2025

 354 

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 109 million and 183 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher payments related to fuel and energy costs and the timing of payments for operating costs, partially offset by higher collections from customers. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 183 million and 190 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to the timing of payments for fuel and energy costs, partially offset by higher collections from customers, the timing of payments for operating costs, lower inventory purchases and increased collections of customer advances. 
 
 The timing of Sierra Pacific's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (351) million and (300) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (300) million and (246) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Refer to "Future Uses of Cash" for further discussion of capital expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 282 million and 107 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher contributions from NV Energy, Inc. and greater proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by higher long-term debt reacquired, higher repayments of short-term debt and higher dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 107 million and 50 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher proceeds from short-term debt and lower dividends paid to NV Energy, Inc., partially offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. 
 
 Ability to Issue Debt 
 
 Sierra Pacific's ability to issue debt is primarily impacted by its financing authority from the PUCN. As of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific has financing authority from the PUCN consisting of the ability to issue long-term and short-term debt securities so long as the total amount of debt outstanding (excluding borrowings under Sierra Pacific's 250 million secured credit facility) does not exceed 1.9 billion and to issue common and preferred stock so long as the total amounts outstanding do not exceed 2.2 billion and 500 million, respectively, as measured at the end of each calendar quarter. Sierra Pacific's revolving credit facility contains a financial maintenance covenant which Sierra Pacific was in compliance with as of December 31, 2022. In addition, certain financing agreements contain covenants which are currently suspended as Sierra Pacific's senior secured debt is rated investment grade. However, if Sierra Pacific's senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either Moody's Investor Service or Standard Poor's, Sierra Pacific would be subject to limitations under these covenants. 
 
 Ability to Issue General and Refunding Mortgage Securities 
 
 To the extent Sierra Pacific has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the PUCN, Sierra Pacific's ability to issue secured debt is limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under Sierra Pacific's indenture. 
 
 355 

Sierra Pacific's indenture creates a lien on substantially all of Sierra Pacific's properties in Nevada. As of December 31, 2022, 4.9 billion of Sierra Pacific's assets were pledged. Sierra Pacific had the capacity to issue 2.0 billion of additional general and refunding mortgage securities as of December 31, 2022 determined on the basis of 70 of net utility property additions. Property additions include plant-in-service and specific assets in construction work-in-progress. The amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in construction work-in-progress. Sierra Pacific also has the ability to release property from the lien of Sierra Pacific's indenture on the basis of net property additions, cash or retired bonds. To the extent Sierra Pacific releases property from the lien of Sierra Pacific's indenture, it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 In June 2022, Sierra Pacific purchased 60 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Gas Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016B, due 2036, as required by the bond indenture. Sierra Pacific is holding these bonds and can re-offer them at a future date. 
 
 In May 2022, Sierra Pacific issued 250 million of 4.71 General and Refunding Mortgage bonds, Series W, due 2052. The net proceeds were used to repay the outstanding 200 million unsecured loan with NV Energy, Inc., repay amounts outstanding under its existing revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 In April 2022, Sierra Pacific entered into a 200 million unsecured loan with NV Energy payable upon demand. The net proceeds were used to purchase certain tax-exempt refunding revenue bond obligations that were subject to mandatory purchase by Sierra Pacific in April 2022. The loan has an underlying variable interest rate based on 30-day U.S. dollar deposits offered on the London Interbank Offered Rate market plus a spread of 0.75 . 
 
 In April 2022, Sierra Pacific purchased the following series of bonds that were held by the public: 30 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016C, due 2036; 25 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016D, due 2036; 25 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016E, due 2036; 75 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016F, due 2036; 20 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Water Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016G, due 2036; and 30 million of its variable-rate tax-exempt Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2016B, due 2029. Sierra Pacific purchased these bonds as required by the bond indentures. Sierra Pacific is holding these bonds and can re-offer them at a future date. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Sierra Pacific has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the use of secured revolving credit facilities, capital contributions and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which Sierra Pacific has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including Sierra Pacific's credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk associated with Sierra Pacific and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customers' rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Prudently incurred expenditures for compliance-related items such as pollution-control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs are generally incorporated into Sierra Pacific's regulated retail rates. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisition of existing assets. 
 
 356 

Historical and forecasted capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, for the years ending December 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 Historical Forecast 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Electric distribution 128 96 113 125 112 269 Electric transmission 60 77 75 45 247 188 Solar generation 17 36 Electric battery storage 18 270 196 Other 58 92 127 141 147 116 Total 246 300 351 311 776 769 
 
 Sierra Pacific received PUCN approval through its recent IRP filings for an increase in solar generation and electric transmission and has included estimates from its latest IRP filing in its forecast capital expenditures for 2022 through 2024. These estimates are likely to change as a result of the RFP process. Sierra Pacific's historical and forecast capital expenditures include the following: 
 Electric distribution includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Electric transmission includes both growth projects and operating expenditures. Growth projects primarily relate to the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. In this project, the company has received approval from the PUCN to build a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. Operating expenditures consist of routine expenditures for transmission and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 
 Solar generation includes solar photovoltaic panels procured for future growth projects. 
 Electric battery storage includes a growth projects consisting of a 200-MW battery energy storage system that will be developed on the site of the Valmy generating station in Humboldt County, Nevada. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2025. 
 Other includes both growth projects and operating expenditures consisting of turbine upgrades at the Tracy generating facility, routine expenditures for generation, other operating projects and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Sierra Pacific has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Notes 7 and 8), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 5), purchased electricity contracts (refer to Note 14), fuel contracts (refer to Note 14), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7 and Note 14) and AROs (refer to Note 11). Refer to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Sierra Pacific has cash requirements relating to interest payments of 647 million on long-term debt, including 48 million due in 2023. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding Sierra Pacific's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 
 
 357 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact Sierra Pacific's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Sierra Pacific believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Sierra Pacific is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt of Sierra Pacific is rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of Sierra Pacific's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. 
 
 Sierra Pacific has no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. Sierra Pacific's secured revolving credit facility does not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon its availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facility are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities. 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance," or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, the applicable credit ratings obtained from recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific would not have been required to post additional collateral. Sierra Pacific's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors. 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where Sierra Pacific operates has not had a significant impact on Sierra Pacific's financial results. Sierra Pacific operates under a cost-of-service based rate-setting structure administered by the PUCN and the FERC. Under this rate-setting structure, Sierra Pacific is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation after Sierra Pacific experiences cost increases. Fuel and purchase power costs are recovered through a balancing account, minimizing the impact of inflation related to these costs. Sierra Pacific attempts to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations through the use of periodic rate adjustments for fuel and energy costs, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by Sierra Pacific's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with Sierra Pacific's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Sierra Pacific's Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 358 

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 Sierra Pacific prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, Sierra Pacific defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 
 Sierra Pacific continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit Sierra Pacific's ability to recover its costs. Sierra Pacific believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at both the federal and state levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be written off to net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 611 million and total regulatory liabilities were 455 million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Sierra Pacific's Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for additional information regarding Sierra Pacific's regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Sierra Pacific evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment was used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. 
 
 The estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of an asset, for the purposes of impairment analysis, requires the exercise of judgment. Circumstances that could significantly alter the calculation of fair value or the recoverable amount of an asset may include significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset, the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect Sierra Pacific's results of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining Sierra Pacific's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by Sierra Pacific's various regulatory commissions. Sierra Pacific's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. Sierra Pacific recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of Sierra Pacific's federal, state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, Sierra Pacific believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on Sierra Pacific's financial results. Refer to Sierra Pacific's Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Sierra Pacific's income taxes. 
 
 It is probable that Sierra Pacific will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to its customers. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 223 million and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 
 
 359 

Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue 
 
 Revenue is recognized as electricity or natural gas is delivered or services are provided. The determination of customer billings is based on a systematic reading of meters. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since their last billing is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was 94 million as of December 31, 2022. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Estimates are reversed in the following month when actual revenue is recorded. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Sierra Pacific's Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. Sierra Pacific's significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which Sierra Pacific transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with Sierra Pacific's business activities. Sierra Pacific has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Sierra Pacific's contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Sierra Pacific is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. Sierra Pacific is principally exposed to electricity, natural gas and coal market fluctuations primarily through Sierra Pacific's obligation to serve retail customer load in its regulated service territory. Sierra Pacific's load and generating facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposures to commodity prices consist mainly of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold, and natural gas supply for retail customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage, and transmission and transportation constraints. The actual cost of fuel and purchased power is recoverable through the deferred energy mechanism. Interest rate risk exists on variable-rate debt and future debt issuances. Sierra Pacific does not engage in proprietary trading activities. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, Sierra Pacific uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. Sierra Pacific does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. Sierra Pacific's exposure to commodity price risk is generally limited by its ability to include commodity costs in regulated rates through its deferred energy mechanism, which is subject to disallowance and regulatory lag that occurs between the time the costs are incurred and when the costs are included in regulated rates, as well as the impact of any customer sharing resulting from cost adjustment mechanisms. 
 
 The table that follows summarizes Sierra Pacific's price risk on commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10 increase and 10 decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of that date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worse case scenarios (dollars in millions). 
 
 Fair Value - Estimated Fair Value after Net Asset Hypothetical Change in Price (Liability) 10 increase 10 decrease As of December 31, 2022: Total commodity derivative contracts (13) (3) (23) As of December 31, 2021: Total commodity derivative contracts (33) (26) (40) 
 
 Sierra Pacific's commodity derivative contracts not designated as hedging contracts are recoverable from customers in regulated rates and therefore, net unrealized gains and losses associated with interim price movements on commodity derivative contracts do not expose Sierra Pacific to earnings volatility. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a net regulatory asset of 13 million and 33 million, respectively, was recorded related to the net derivative liability of 13 million and 33 million, respectively. The settled cost of these commodity derivative contracts is generally included in regulated rates. 
 
 360 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Sierra Pacific is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. Sierra Pacific manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, Sierra Pacific's fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose Sierra Pacific to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Sierra Pacific were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. The nature and amount of Sierra Pacific's short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Notes 7 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of Sierra Pacific's short- and long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Sierra Pacific had short-term variable-rate obligations totaling million and 159 million, respectively, that expose Sierra Pacific to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on Sierra Pacific's annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Sierra Pacific is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Sierra Pacific's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Sierra Pacific analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, Sierra Pacific enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtain third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, Sierra Pacific exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific's aggregate credit exposure from energy related transactions were not material, based on settlement and mark-to-market exposures, net of collateral.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 Sierra Pacific Power Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sierra Pacific Power Company and subsidiaries ("Sierra Pacific") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sierra Pacific as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Sierra Pacific's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sierra Pacific's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Sierra Pacific in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Sierra Pacific is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Sierra Pacific's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Sierra Pacific is subject to rate regulation by a state public service commission as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas companies in the respective service territories where Sierra Pacific operates. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economic effects of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 363 

Regulated rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined, approved, and established based on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow Sierra Pacific an opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an effect on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. While Sierra Pacific Power Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that changes to the Commissions' approach to setting rates or other regulatory actions could limit Sierra Pacific's ability to recover its costs. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated Sierra Pacific's disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected Sierra Pacific's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. We inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.

 (2) Amounts represent estimated costs, as accrued through depreciation rates and exclusive of ARO liabilities, of removing regulated property, plant and equipment in accordance with accepted regulatory practices. 
 
 Deferred Energy 
 
 Nevada statutes permit regulated utilities to adopt deferred energy accounting procedures. The intent of these procedures is to ease the effect on customers of fluctuations in the cost of purchased natural gas, fuel and electricity and are subject to annual prudency review by the PUCN. Under deferred energy accounting, to the extent actual fuel and purchased power costs exceed fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates that excess is not recorded as a current expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations but rather is deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and would be included in the table above as deferred energy costs. Conversely, a regulatory liability is recorded to the extent fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates exceed actual fuel and purchased power costs and is included in the table above as deferred energy costs. These excess amounts are reflected in quarterly adjustments to rates and recorded as cost of fuel, energy and capacity in future time periods. 
 
 Regulatory Rate Review 
 
 In June 2022, Sierra Pacific filed a regulatory rate review with the PUCN that requested an annual revenue increase of million, or . In addition, a filing was made to revise depreciation rates based on a study, the results of which are reflected in the proposed revenue requirement. In August 2022, Sierra Pacific filed an updated certification filing that requested an annual revenue increase of million, or . Parties to the review filed testimony and evidence in August and September 2022. Hearings in the cost of capital, revenue requirement, and rate design phases were held in September, October, and November 2022, respectively. In December 2022, the PUCN issued an order approving an increase in base rates of million, effective January 1, 2023, reflecting a reduction in Sierra Pacific's requested rate of return, updated depreciation and amortization rates for its electric operations and updated time of use periods to reflect the changes in system costs due to the increased solar generation on the system.

 Credit Risk 
 
 Sierra Pacific is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Sierra Pacific's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Sierra Pacific analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, Sierra Pacific enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtain third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, Sierra Pacific exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance" if there is a material adverse change in Sierra Pacific's creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, Sierra Pacific's credit ratings for its senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. 
 
 The aggregate fair value of Sierra Pacific's derivative contracts in liability positions with specific credit-risk-related contingent features totaled as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents the amount of collateral to be posted if all credit risk related contingent features for derivative contracts in liability positions had been triggered. Sierra Pacific's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation or other factors.

Money market mutual funds Investment funds Liabilities - commodity derivatives ) ) As of December 31, 2021: Assets: Commodity derivatives Money market mutual funds Investment funds Liabilities - commodity derivatives ) ) 
 
 Sierra Pacific's investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. 
 
 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which Sierra Pacific transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, Sierra Pacific uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent Sierra Pacific's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. Sierra Pacific bases its forward price curves upon internally developed models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations for certain electricity and natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to markets that are not active. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, Sierra Pacific uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The model incorporates a mid-market pricing convention (the mid point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The determination of the fair value for derivative contracts not only includes counterparty risk, but also the impact of Sierra Pacific's nonperformance risk on its liabilities, which as of December 31, 2022, had an immaterial impact to the fair value of its derivative contracts. As such, Sierra Pacific considers its derivative contracts to be valued using Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Sierra Pacific's investments in money market mutual funds and equity securities are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and are stated at fair value.

 reportable operating segments: regulated electric and regulated natural gas. The regulated electric segment derives most of its revenue from regulated retail sales of electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and from wholesale sales. The regulated natural gas segment derives most of its revenue from regulated retail sales of natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and also obtains revenue by transporting natural gas owned by others through its distribution system. Pricing for regulated electric and regulated natural gas sales are established separately by the PUCN; therefore, management also reviews each segment separately to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and in evaluating performance.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Eastern Energy Gas during the periods included herein. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Eastern Energy Gas' historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Eastern Energy Gas' actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income attributable to Eastern Energy Gas for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 426 million, an increase of 164 million, or 63 , compared to 2021, primarily due to higher margin from EGTS' regulated gas transmission and storage operations of 128 million, a benefit from the settlement of regulated tax matters in the Iroquois rate case and a decrease due to the settlement of depreciation rates in EGTS' general rate case, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense primarily due to higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Net income attributable to Eastern Energy Gas for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 262 million, an increase of 153 million, or 140 , compared to 2020, primarily due to a 2020 charge associated with the abandonment of a significant portion of a project in connection with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project ("Supply Header Project") and a 2020 charge for cash flow hedges of debt-related items that were probable of not occurring as a result of the GT S Transaction. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net income attributable to DEI's 50 noncontrolling interest in Cove Point and the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group of 75 million, both of which were a result of the GT S Transaction, and an increase in income tax expense primarily due to higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Operating revenue increased 136 million, or 7 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in regulated gas transmission and storage services revenues due to the settlement of EGTS' general rate case of 101 million, an increase in Cove Point LNG variable revenue of 69 million and an increase in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 24 million, partially offset by a decrease in regulated gas sales for operational and system balancing purposes primarily due to decreased volumes of 49 million and decreased LNG service as a result of increased scheduled maintenance days of 13 million. 
 
 (Excess) cost of gas was a credit of 30 million for 2022 compared to an expense of 12 million for 2021. The change is primarily due to a decrease in volumes sold of 62 million, partially offset by an unfavorable change to operational and system balancing volumes of 20 million. 
 
 Operations and maintenance increased 15 million, or 3 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a 2021 benefit from the finalization of entries for the disallowance of capitalized AFUDC of 11 million and higher corporate charges of 11 million, partially offset by lower long-term incentive plan expenses of 8 million. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 7 million, or 2 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the settlement of depreciation rates in EGTS' general rate case of 23 million, partially offset by higher plant placed in-service of 16 million. 
 
 Property and other taxes decreased 10 million, or 7 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower than estimated 2021 tax assessments. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 4 million, or 3 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the repayment of 500 million of long-term debt in the second quarter of 2021. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased 7 million for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to interest income from BHE GT S' intercompany revolving credit agreement with Eastern Energy Gas. 
 
 Other, net was an expense of 1 million for 2022 compared to a credit of 1 million for 2021. The change is primarily due to losses on marketable securities. 
 
 391 

Income tax expense (benefit) increased 50 million, or 43 , for 2022 compared to 2021 and the effective tax rate was 18 for 2022 and 16 for 2021. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to the revaluation of deferred taxes from changes in various state income tax rates. 
 
 Equity income increased 59 million for 2022 compared 2021, primarily due to a benefit from the settlement of regulated tax matters in the Iroquois rate case of 45 million and higher operating revenues at Iroquois due to favorable fixed negotiated rate agreements and hedges of 15 million. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 33 million for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in Cove Point LNG variable revenue, partially offset by decreased LNG service as a result of increased scheduled maintenance days. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 Operating revenue decreased 220 million, or 11 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group of 197 million and a decrease in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline of 43 million, which is offset in operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by an increase in regulated gas revenues for operational and system balancing purposes primarily due to increased prices of 15 million. 
 
 Cost of gas decreased 12 million, or 50 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a favorable change in natural gas prices of 55 million and the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group of 3 million, partially offset by an increase in prices of natural gas sold of 49 million. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 627 million, or 55 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a 2020 charge associated with the abandonment of the Supply Header Project of 463 million, a decrease in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline of 45 million, the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group of 43 million, a 2020 charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC due to the resolution of EGTS' 2015 FERC audit of 43 million, the 2020 write-off of certain items in connection with the GT S Transaction of 17 million and a 2021 benefit from the finalization of entries for the disallowance of capitalized AFUDC of 11 million. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 38 million, or 10 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 9 million, or 6 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher tax assessments. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 188 million, or 55 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a charge in 2020 for cash flow hedges of 141 million of debt-related items that were probable of not occurring as a result of the GT S Transaction, the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group of 16 million and lower interest expense of 17 million from the repayment of 700 million of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5 million from the repayment of 500 million of long-term debt in the second quarter of 2021. 
 
 Allowance for borrowed funds decreased 4 million, or 67 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the 2020 abandonment of the Supply Header Project. 
 
 Allowance for equity funds decreased 6 million, or 46 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the 2020 abandonment of the Supply Header Project. 
 
 Interest and dividend income decreased 67 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to interest income from the East Ohio Gas Company of 33 million and DEI of 32 million recognized in 2020. 
 
 Other, net decreased 41 million, or 98 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to non-service cost credits recognized in 2020 related to certain Eastern Energy Gas benefit plans that were retained by DEI as a result of the GT S Transaction. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense of 117 million for 2021 compared to a benefit of 24 million for 2020. The effective tax rate was 16 in 2021 and (12) in 2020. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to the change in the noncontrolling interest of Cove Point as a result of the GT S Transaction, lower pre-tax income driven by charges associated with the Supply Header Project in 2020 and the finalization of the effects from the change in tax status of certain Eastern Energy Gas subsidiaries in 2020. 
 
 392 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 226 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to DEI's 50 noncontrolling interest in Cove Point effective with the GT S Transaction. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Eastern Energy Gas' total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 65 Intercompany revolving credit agreement (1) 
 400 Total net liquidity 465 Intercompany credit agreement: Maturity date 2023 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for further discussion regarding Eastern Energy Gas' intercompany revolving credit agreement. 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1.3 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to the impacts from the proposed rate increase in effect April 1, 2022 for the EGTS general rate case, timing of income tax payments and other changes in working capital, partially offset by lower collections from customers. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower collections from affiliates, the November 2020 disposition of Questar Pipeline Group and the timing of payments of operating costs, partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swaps in 2020 and higher income tax receipts. 
 
 The timing of Eastern Energy Gas' income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods elected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (778) million and (486) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher loans to affiliates of 381 million and lower repayments of loans by affiliates of 266 million, partially offset by equity method distribution of 150 million in 2022, equity method contributions of 154 million in 2021 and a decrease in capital expenditures of 55 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (486) million and 3.1 billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower repayments of loans by affiliates of 3.1 billion, loans to affiliates of 183 million and higher funding of equity method investments of 152 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were (515) million and consisted of distributions to noncontrolling interests from Cove Point. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were (615) million. Sources of cash totaled 346 million and consisted of proceeds from equity contributions, that included a contribution from its indirect parent, BHE, to Eastern Energy Gas to assist in the repayment of 500 million of debt. Uses of cash totaled 961 million and consisted mainly of repayments of long-term debt of 500 million, distributions to noncontrolling interests from Cove Point of 450 million and repayment of notes to affiliates of 9 million. 
 
 393 

Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were (4.3) billion. Sources of cash totaled 1.2 billion and consisted of proceeds from equity contributions, that included a contribution from its indirect parent BHE to Eastern Energy Gas to repay its 700 million of debt. Uses of cash totaled 5.5 billion and consisted mainly of distributions of 4.5 billion, repayments of long-term debt of 700 million and net repayments of affiliated current borrowings of 251 million as required by the GT S Transaction. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, new growth projects and the timing of growth projects; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customers' rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' historical and forecasted capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, for the years ending December 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 Historical Forecast 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Natural gas transmission and storage 112 16 43 15 46 147 Other 262 426 344 336 285 245 Total 374 442 387 351 331 392 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' natural gas transmission and storage capital expenditures primarily include growth capital expenditures related to planned regulated projects. Eastern Energy Gas' other capital expenditures consist primarily of nonregulated and routine capital expenditures for natural gas transmission, storage and LNG terminalling infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on Eastern Energy Gas' Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for Eastern Energy Gas' pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, Eastern Energy Gas' investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of 307 million and an unused revolving credit facility of 10 million. As of December 31, 2022, Eastern Energy Gas' pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was 154 million and unused revolving credit facility was 5 million. The entire amount of Eastern Energy Gas' pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facility is non-recourse to Eastern Energy Gas. Although Eastern Energy Gas is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity. 
 
 394 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 The following table summarizes Eastern Energy Gas' material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): 
 
 Payments Due by Periods 2023 2024-2025 2026-2027 2028 and thereafter Total Interest payments on long-term debt (1) 
 136 205 164 1,012 1,517 Natural gas supply and transmission (1) 
 49 98 98 245 Total cash requirements 185 303 262 1,012 1,762 
 (1) Not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 In addition, Eastern Energy Gas also has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise from long-term debt (refer to Note 8), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 9) and AROs (refer to Note 11). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding Eastern Energy Gas' general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. Eastern Energy Gas believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and Eastern Energy Gas is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt of Eastern Energy Gas is rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of Eastern Energy Gas' ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas has no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. 
 
 395 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where Eastern Energy Gas operates have not had a significant impact on Eastern Energy Gas' consolidated financial results. Eastern Energy Gas and its subsidiaries primarily operate under cost-of-service based rate-setting structures administered by the FERC. Under these rate-setting structures, Eastern Energy Gas is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation. Eastern Energy Gas attempts to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by Eastern Energy Gas' methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with Eastern Energy Gas' Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Eastern Energy Gas' Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, Eastern Energy Gas defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit Eastern Energy Gas' ability to recover its costs. Eastern Energy Gas believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal level. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 48 million and total regulatory liabilities were 722 million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Eastern Energy Gas' Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Eastern Energy Gas' regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of 1.3 billion. Eastern Energy Gas evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31, 2022. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2022. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Eastern Energy Gas uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, Eastern Energy Gas incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. 
 
 396 

Eastern Energy Gas evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. 
 
 The estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of an asset, for the purposes of impairment analysis, requires the exercise of judgment. Circumstances that could significantly alter the calculation of fair value or the recoverable amount of an asset may include significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset, the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect Eastern Energy Gas' results of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining Eastern Energy Gas' income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the FERC. Eastern Energy Gas' income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. Eastern Energy Gas recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of Eastern Energy Gas' federal, state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, Eastern Energy Gas believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on Eastern Energy Gas' consolidated financial results. Refer to Eastern Energy Gas' Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Eastern Energy Gas' income taxes. 
 
 It is probable that Eastern Energy Gas will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 406 million and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas' Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. Eastern Energy Gas' significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency and the extension of credit to counterparties with which Eastern Energy Gas transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with Eastern Energy Gas' business activities. Eastern Energy Gas has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Eastern Energy Gas' contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices. Eastern Energy Gas is principally exposed to natural gas market fluctuations primarily through fuel retained and used during the operation of the pipeline system as well as lost and unaccounted for gas. Eastern Energy Gas is exposed to the risk of fuel retention, meaning customers have a fixed fuel retention percentage assessed on transmission and storage quantities, and the pipeline bears the risk of under-recovery and benefits from any over-recovery of volumes. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission constraints. Eastern Energy Gas does not engage in proprietary trading activities. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, Eastern Energy Gas uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply quantities or sell future supply quantities generally at fixed prices. Eastern Energy Gas does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. As of February 2023, all of Eastern Energy Gas' regulated operations recover their cost of gas through fuel trackers and are no longer subject to significant commodity price risk. 
 397 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. Eastern Energy Gas manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, Eastern Energy Gas' fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose Eastern Energy Gas to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if Eastern Energy Gas were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. The nature and amount of Eastern Energy Gas' short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of Eastern Energy Gas' long-term debt. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas holds foreign currency swaps with the purpose of hedging the foreign currency exchange risk associated with Euro denominated debt. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Eastern Energy Gas had 250 million in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency swaps outstanding. A hypothetical 10 decrease in market interest rates would not have resulted in a material decrease in fair value of Eastern Energy Gas' foreign currency swaps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 The impact of a change in interest rates on the Eastern Energy Gas' interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with natural gas transmission and storage service contracts with utilities, natural gas producers, power generators, industrials, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Eastern Energy Gas' counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Eastern Energy Gas analyzes the financial condition of each wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, Eastern Energy Gas obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit, financial guarantee bonds and cash deposits. If required, Eastern Energy Gas exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors of Eastern Energy Gas Holdings, LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eastern Energy Gas Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries ("Eastern Energy Gas") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eastern Energy Gas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Eastern Energy Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Eastern Energy Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Eastern Energy Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Eastern Energy Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Eastern Energy Gas' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas, through its subsidiaries, is subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of interstate natural gas transmission companies. Management has determined its rate regulated subsidiaries meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 400 

Revenue provided by the Eastern Energy Gas interstate natural gas transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by the FERC. Eastern Energy Gas defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. Eastern Energy Gas continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit Eastern Energy Gas' ability to recover its costs. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation on the financial statements as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the FERC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of the accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated the Eastern Energy Gas disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected Eastern Energy Gas' filings with the FERC, and the filings with the FERC by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the FERC's treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.

 of the general partner interest and of the limited partnership interest in Cove Point. In addition, Eastern Energy Gas owns a noncontrolling interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. ("Iroquois"), a -mile FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline. On November 1, 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company ("BHE") completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of Dominion Energy, Inc. ("DEI") (the "GT S Transaction"). As a result of the GT S Transaction, Eastern Energy Gas became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE. BHE is a holding company based in Des Moines, Iowa that owns subsidiaries principally engaged in the energy industry. BHE is a consolidated subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire Hathaway"). See Note 3 for more information regarding the GT S Transaction.

million and million, respectively. Payments for amounts billed are generally due from the customer within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price as well as the allocation of price amongst the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. See Note 6 for discussion surrounding the Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. ("EGTS") provision for rate refund. In the event one of the parties to a contract has performed before the other, Eastern Energy Gas would recognize a contract asset or contract liability depending on the relationship between Eastern Energy Gas' performance and the customer's payment. Eastern Energy Gas has recognized contract assets of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and million and million of contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to Eastern Energy Gas' performance on certain contracts.

 limited partnership interest in Cove Point, to BHE. Approval of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act was not obtained within 75 days and DEI and BHE mutually agreed to a dual-phase closing consisting of two separate disposal groups identified as the GT S Transaction and the proposed sale of Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, LLC and related entities ("the Questar Pipeline Group") by DEI to BHE pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement entered into on October 5, 2020 ("Q-Pipe Transaction"). In July 2021, Dominion Energy Questar Corporation ("Dominion Questar") and DEI delivered a written notice to BHE stating that BHE and Dominion Questar mutually elected to terminate the Q-Pipe Transaction. Prior to the completion of the GT S Transaction, Eastern Energy Gas finalized a restructuring whereby Eastern Energy Gas distributed the Questar Pipeline Group and a noncontrolling interest in Cove Point to DEI. This restructuring was accounted for by Eastern Energy Gas as a reorganization of entities under common control and the disposition was reflected as an equity transaction. The disposition was not reported as a discontinued operation as the disposal did not represent a strategic shift in the way management had intended to run the business. 
 
 In November 2020, the GT S Transaction was completed and Eastern Energy Gas, with the exception of the Questar Pipeline Group as discussed above, became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE. DEI retained a noncontrolling interest in Cove Point as well as the assets and obligations of the pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans associated with the operations sold and relating to services provided before closing. The GT S Transaction was treated as a deemed asset sale for federal and state income tax purposes and all deferred taxes at Eastern Energy Gas were reset to reflect financial and tax basis differences as of November 1, 2020. See Notes 9 and 16 for more information on the GT S Transaction. 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas recorded a distribution of net assets of million, including goodwill of million and million of cash, for the distribution of the Questar Pipeline Group to DEI and recorded an approximately billion increase in noncontrolling interests for DEI's retained noncontrolling interest in Cove Point. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the GT S Transaction, DEI retained certain assets and liabilities associated with Eastern Energy Gas and settled all affiliated balances. As a result, Eastern Energy Gas recorded a contribution for the reset of deferred taxes of billion, net of distributions of million related to the pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans retained by DEI and million related to the settlement of affiliated balances.

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. 
 
 In September 2021, EGTS filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective November 1, 2021. EGTS' previous general rate case was settled in 1998. EGTS proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately billion, and requested increases in various rates, including general system storage rates by and general system transmission rates by . In October 2021, the FERC issued an order that accepted the November 1, 2021 effective date for certain changes in rates, while suspending the other changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until April 1, 2022, subject to refund. In September 2022, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving EGTS' general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and decreased depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, EGTS' rates result in an increase to annual firm transmission and storage revenues of approximately million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million, compared to the rates in effect prior to April 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, EGTS' provision for rate refund for April 2022 through December 2022 totaled million and was included in current regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2022, the FERC approved the settlement agreement.

million million after-tax) estimated charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC, recorded within operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a condition of the December 2020 ruling, EGTS filed its proposed accounting entries and supporting documentation with the FERC during the second quarter of 2021. During the finalization of these entries, EGTS refined the estimated charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC, which resulted in a reduction to the estimated charge of million million after-tax) that was recorded in operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the second quarter of 2021. In September 2021, the FERC approved EGTS' accounting entries and supporting documentation. 
 
 In December 2014, EGTS entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC ("Atlantic Cost Pipeline") for the project previously intended for EGTS to provide approximately decatherms ("Dth") of firm transmission service to various customers in connection with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project ("Supply Header Project"). As a result of the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, in the second quarter of 2020 Eastern Energy Gas recorded a charge of million million after-tax) in operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Operations associated with the probable abandonment of a significant portion of the project as well as the establishment of a million ARO. In the third quarter of 2020, Eastern Energy Gas recorded an additional charge of million million after-tax) associated with the probable abandonment of a significant portion of the project and a million million after-tax) benefit from a revision to the previously established ARO, both of which were recorded in operations and maintenance expense in Eastern Energy Gas' Consolidated Statement of Operations. As EGTS evaluates its future use, approximately million remains within property, plant and equipment for a potential modified project. 
 
 Cove Point 
 
 In January 2020, pursuant to the terms of a previous settlement, Cove Point filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective March 1, 2020. Cove Point proposed an annual cost-of-service of million. In February 2020, FERC approved suspending the changes in rates for five months following the proposed effective date, until August 1, 2020, subject to refund. In November 2020, Cove Point reached an agreement in principle with the active participants in the general rate case proceeding. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, Cove Point's rates effective August 1, 2020 resulted in an increase to annual revenues of million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of million, compared to the rates in effect prior to August 1, 2020. The interim settlement rates were implemented November 1, 2020, and Cove Point's provision for rate refunds for August 2020 through October 2020 totaled million. The agreement in principle was reflected in a stipulation and agreement filed with the FERC in January 2021. In March 2021, the FERC approved the stipulation and agreement and the rate refunds to customers were processed in late April 2021.

 Pension benefits for Eastern Energy Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units were covered by a separate pension plan that provides benefits to employees of both EGTS and Hope Gas, Inc. ("Hope"). Employee compensation was the basis for allocating pension costs and obligations between EGTS and Hope. Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits for Eastern Energy Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units were covered by a separate other postretirement benefit plan that provides benefits to both EGTS and Hope. Employee headcount was the basis for allocating other postretirement benefit costs and obligations between EGTS and Hope. 
 
 Pension Remeasurement 
 
 In the third quarter of 2020, Eastern Energy Gas remeasured a pension plan due to a curtailment resulting from the agreement for DEI to retain the assets and obligations of the pension benefit plan associated with the GT S Transaction. The remeasurement resulted in an increase in the pension benefit obligation of million and a decrease in the fair value of the pension plan assets of million for Eastern Energy Gas. The impact of the remeasurement on net periodic pension benefit credit was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and was not material. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was . All other assumptions used for the remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2019.

 Credit Risk 
 
 Eastern Energy Gas is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent Eastern Energy Gas' counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, Eastern Energy Gas analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, Eastern Energy Gas enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, Eastern Energy Gas exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement.

 Eastern Energy Gas' investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. 
 
 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchase or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which Eastern Energy Gas transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, Eastern Energy Gas uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent Eastern Energy Gas' estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. Eastern Energy Gas bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by Eastern Energy Gas. Market price quotations are generally readily obtainable for the applicable term of Eastern Energy Gas' outstanding derivative contracts; therefore, Eastern Energy Gas' forward price curves reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for certain natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to the length of the contracts. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, Eastern Energy Gas uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of EGTS during the periods included herein. This discussion should be read in conjunction with EGTS' historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. EGTS' actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 261 million, an increase of 105 million, or 67 , compared to 2021, primarily due to higher margin from regulated gas transmission and storage operations of 128 million and a decrease due to the settlement of depreciation rates in EGTS' general rate case, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense primarily due to higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 156 million compared to a net loss of 181 million for 2020, primarily due to a 2020 charge associated with the abandonment of a significant portion of a project in connection with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project ("Supply Header Project") and a 2020 charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC due to the resolution of EGTS' 2015 FERC audit, partially offset by a decrease of 50 million due to non-service cost credits recognized in 2020 related to certain Eastern Energy Gas over-funded benefit plans that were retained DEI as a result of the GT S Transaction and an increase in income tax expense primarily due to higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 
 Operating revenue increased 82 million, or 9 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in regulated gas transmission and storage services revenues due to the settlement of EGTS' general rate case of 101 million and an increase in variable revenue related to park and loan activity of 24 million, partially offset by a decrease in regulated gas sales for operational and system balancing purposes primarily due to decreased volumes of 49 million. 
 
 (Excess) cost of gas was a credit of 33 million for 2022 compared to an expense of 13 million for 2021. The change is primarily due to a decrease in volumes sold of 62 million, partially offset by unfavorable change to operational and system balancing volumes of 20 million. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 12 million, or 3 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in post-retirement benefit related costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 14 million, or 8 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the settlement of depreciation rates in EGTS' general rate case of 23 million, partially offset by higher plant placed in-service of 9 million. 
 
 Property and other taxes decreased 8 million, or 13 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower than estimated 2021 tax assessments. 
 
 Disallowance and abandonment of utility plant was a credit of 11 million for 2021. The change is due to a 2021 benefit from the finalization of entries for the disallowance of capitalized AFUDC. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 9 million, or 12 , for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower expense of 44 million related to the elimination of long-term indebtedness to Eastern Energy Gas following the Debt Exchange Transaction in June 2021. These decreases were partially offset by 32 million of interest expense incurred under the senior notes issued in connection with that transaction, which bear lower interest rates than the original long-term indebtedness to Eastern Energy Gas. 
 
 Other, net was an expense of 2 million for 2022 compared to a credit of 2 million in 2021. The change is primarily due to losses on marketable securities. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) increased 48 million , or 79 , for 2022 compared to 2021 and the effective tax rate was 29 in 2022 and 28 in 2021. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to the revaluation of deferred taxes from changes in various state income tax rates. 
 
 435 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 
 Operating revenu e decreased 25 million, or 3 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to 43 million of lower fees earned for services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline, partially offset by an increase in regulated natural gas sales of 15 million for operational and system balancing purposes primarily due to higher natural gas prices. 
 
 Cost of ga s decreased 8 million, or 38 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to favorable valuations of system gas of 55 million, partially offset by an increase in prices of natural gas sold of 49 million. 
 
 Operations and maintenance decreased 16 million, or 4 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower expenses incurred in connection with services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline in connection with the cancelled Atlantic Coast Pipeline project of 45 million, partially offset by a 27 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits and general administrative expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 3 million, or 2 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher plant placed in-service during 2021. 
 
 Property and other taxes increased 9 million, or 17 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher property tax assessments. 
 
 Disallowance and abandonment of utility plan t was a credit of 11 million for 2021 compared to an expense of 525 million for 2020. The change is primarily due to a 2020 charge associated with the abandonment of the Supply Header Project of 463 million, a 2020 charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC due to the resolution of EGTS' 2015 FERC audit of 43 million, the 2020 write-off of certain items in connection with the GT S Transaction of 18 million and a 2021 benefit from the finalization of entries for the disallowance of capitalized AFUDC of 11 million. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 11 million, or 12 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower expense of 44 million related to the elimination of long-term indebtedness to Eastern Energy Gas following the Debt Exchange Transaction in June 2021. These decreases were partially offset by 32 million of interest expense incurred under the senior notes issued in connection with that transaction, which bear lower interest rates than the original long-term indebtedness to Eastern Energy Gas. 
 
 Allowance for equity funds decreased 6 million, or 50 , for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower capital expenditures related to the Supply Header Project as a result of the abandonment of the project. 
 
 Other, net decreased 60 million, or 97 , for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to non-service cost credits recognized in 2020 related to the overfunded status of certain DEI benefit plans in which EGTS' employees participated prior to the GT S Transaction. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense of 61 million for 2021 compared to a benefit of 67 million for 2020. The effective tax rate was 28 in 2021 and 27 in 2020. 
 
 436 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, EGTS' total net liquidity was as follows (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents 16 Intercompany revolving credit agreement (1) 
 400 Less: Notes payable to affiliates 36 Net intercompany revolving credit agreement 364 Total net liquidity 380 Intercompany credit agreement: Maturity date 2023 
 
 (1) Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 - K for further discussion regarding EGTS' intercompany revolving credit agreement. 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 552 million and 367 million, respectively. The change was primarily due to the impacts from the proposed rate increase in effect April 1, 2022 for the EGTS general rate case, timing of income tax payments, higher collections of receivables from affiliates and other working capital adjustments. 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 367 million. Higher collections of non-trade receivables and lower payments on outstanding accounts payable balances were offset by lower collections from affiliates and other changes in working capital amounts. 
 
 The timing of EGTS' income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (286) million and (357) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 83 million and lower loans to affiliates of 6 million, partially offset by lower repayments of loans by affiliates of 8 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (357) million and (265) million, respectively. The change was primarily due to increases in capital expenditures of 95 million related to increased pipeline integrity work. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were (247) million and consisted of dividends paid to Eastern Energy Gas of 215 million and net repayment of notes payable to Eastern Energy Gas of 32 million. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were (7) million, primarily reflecting dividends paid of 18 million and the net repayment of notes payable to Eastern Energy Gas of 13 million, partially offset by a 20 million equity contribution from Eastern Energy Gas. 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were (91) million, reflecting dividends paid of 125 million, partially offset by the issuance of notes payable from Eastern Energy Gas of 34 million. 
 
 437 

Short-term Debt 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, EGTS had 36 million of an outstanding note payable to an affiliate at a weighted average interest rate of 1.43 . As of December 31, 2021, EGTS had 68 million of an outstanding note payable to an affiliate at a weighted average interest rate of 0.51 . For further discussion, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Future Uses of Cash 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, new growth projects and the timing of growth projects; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; impacts to customers' rates; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. 
 
 EGTS' historical and forecasted capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, for the years ending December 31 are as follows (in millions): 
 Historical Forecast 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Natural gas transmission and storage 110 10 35 9 40 107 Other 153 348 240 191 173 173 Total 263 358 275 200 213 280 
 
 EGTS' natural gas transmission and storage capital expenditures primarily include growth capital expenditures related to planned regulated projects. EGTS' other capital expenditures consist primarily of pipeline integrity work, automation and controls upgrades, underground storage, corrosion control, unit exchanges, compressor modifications and projects related to Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration natural gas storage rules. The amounts also include EGTS' asset modernization program, which includes projects for vintage pipeline replacement, compression replacement, pipeline assessment and underground storage integrity. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 The following table summarizes EGTS' material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): 
 
 Payments Due by Periods 2023 2024-2025 2026-2027 2028 and thereafter Total Interest payments on long-term debt (1)

 49 98 98 245 Total cash requirements 113 223 219 873 1,428 
 (1) Not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 In addition, EGTS also has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise from operating leases (refer to Note 6), long-term debt (refer to Note 9), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 10) and AROs (refer to Note 12). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information. 
 
 438 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 EGTS is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding EGTS' general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
 EGTS is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state and local agencies. EGTS believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and EGTS is unable to predict the impact of the changing laws and regulations on its operations and financial results. 
 
 Refer to "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations. 

Collateral and Contingent Features 
 
 Debt of EGTS is rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of EGTS' ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time. 
 
 EGTS has no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. 

Inflation 
 
 Historically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where EGTS operates have not had a significant impact on EGTS' consolidated financial results. EGTS operates under cost-of-service based rate-setting structures administered by the FERC. Under these rate-setting structures, EGTS is allowed to include prudent costs in its rates, including the impact of inflation. EGTS attempts to minimize the potential impact of inflation on its operations by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Certain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by EGTS' methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with EGTS' Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in EGTS' Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation 
 
 EGTS prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, EGTS defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. 
 439 

EGTS continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit EGTS' ability to recover its costs. EGTS believes its application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal level. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were 39 million and total regulatory liabilities were 627 million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to EGTS' Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding EGTS' regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 EGTS evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment supports EGTS' regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. 
 
 The estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of an asset, for the purposes of impairment analysis, requires the exercise of judgment. Circumstances that could significantly alter the calculation of fair value or the recoverable amount of an asset may include significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset, the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect EGTS' results of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining EGTS' income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the FERC. EGTS' income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. EGTS recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of EGTS' federal, state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, EGTS believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations is not expected to have a material impact on EGTS' consolidated financial results. Refer to EGTS' Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding EGTS' income taxes. 
 
 It is probable that EGTS will pass income tax benefit and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35 to 21 as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2022, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of 382 million and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 EGTS' Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities with fair values that are subject to market risks. EGTS' significant market risks are primarily associated with commodity prices, interest rates and the extension of credit to counterparties with which EGTS transacts. The following discussion addresses the significant market risks associated with EGTS' business activities. EGTS has established guidelines for credit risk management. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding EGTS' contracts accounted for as derivatives. 
 
 440 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 EGTS is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices. EGTS is principally exposed to natural gas market fluctuations primarily through fuel retained and used during the operation of the pipeline system as well as lost and unaccounted for gas. EGTS is exposed to the risk of fuel retention, meaning customers have a fixed fuel retention percentage assessed on transmission and storage quantities, and the pipeline bears the risk of under-recovery and benefits from any over-recovery of volumes. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission constraints. EGTS does not engage in proprietary trading activities. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, EGTS uses commodity derivative contracts, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply quantities or sell future supply quantities generally at fixed prices. EGTS does not hedge all of its commodity price risk, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices. As of February 2023, EGTS recovers its cost of gas through a fuel tracker and is no longer subject to significant commodity price risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 EGTS is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding variable-rate short- and long-term debt and future debt issuances. EGTS manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. As a result of the fixed interest rates, EGTS' fixed-rate long-term debt does not expose EGTS to the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, because fixed-rate long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if EGTS were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. The nature and amount of EGTS' short- and long-term debt can be expected to vary from period to period as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of EGTS' long-term debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, EGTS had short- and long-term variable-rate obligations totaling 36 million and 68 million, respectively, that expose EGTS to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. If variable interest rates were to increase by 10 from December 31 levels, it would not have a material effect on EGTS' annual interest expense. The carrying value of the variable-rate obligations approximates fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 EGTS is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with natural gas transmission and storage service contracts with utilities, natural gas producers, power generators, industrials, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent EGTS' counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct and indirect relationships among the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, EGTS analyzes the financial condition of each wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, EGTS obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit, financial guarantee bonds and cash deposits. If required, EGTS exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement. 
 
 EGTS' gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of collateral. As of December 31, 2022, EGTS credit exposure totaled 90 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 98 , with three investment grade counterparties representing 57 .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors of Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc., and subsidiaries ("EGTS") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholder's equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EGTS as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of EGTS' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on EGTS' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to EGTS in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. EGTS is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of EGTS' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Effects of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 EGTS prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Management has determined EGTS meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accordingly, EGTS defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur. Furthermore, revenue provided by EGTS' interstate natural gas transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). 
 
 443 

EGTS continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit EGTS' ability to recover its costs. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers, or re-established as accumulated comprehensive income (loss). Accounting for the economics of rate regulation has a pervasive effect on the financial statements. 
 
 We identified the effects of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the FERC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of the accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the assessment of whether recovery of regulatory assets through future rates or a regulatory liability due to customers is probable included the following, among others: 
 We evaluated EGTS' disclosures related to the effects of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC, as well as relevant regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other external information. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory assets and liability balances for completeness and to assess whether this external information was properly considered by management in concluding upon the financial statement impacts of rate regulation. 
 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected EGTS' filings with the FERC, and the filings with the FERC by intervenors to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of refunds due to customers based on precedents of the FERC's treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.

Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price as well as the allocation of price amongst the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. See Note 7 for discussion surrounding EGTS' provision for rate refund. In the event one of the parties to a contract has performed before the other, EGTS would recognize a contract asset or contract liability depending on the relationship between EGTS' performance and the customer's payment.

Regulatory Matters 
 
 In September 2021, EGTS filed a general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services, with proposed rates to be effective November 1, 2021. EGTS' previous general rate case was settled in 1998. EGTS proposed an annual cost-of-service of approximately billion, and requested increases in various rates, including general system storage rates by and general system transmission rates by . In October 2021, the FERC issued an order that accepted the November 1, 2021 effective date for certain changes in rates, while suspending the other changes for five months following the proposed effective date, until April 1, 2022, subject to refund. In September 2022, a settlement agreement was filed with the FERC, resolving EGTS' general rate case for its FERC-jurisdictional services and providing for increased service rates and decreased depreciation rates. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, EGTS' rates result in an increase to annual firm transmission and storage revenues of approximately million and a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million, compared to the rates in effect prior to April 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, EGTS' provision for rate refund for April 2022 through December 2022 totaled million and was included in current regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2022, the FERC approved the settlement agreement.

million million after-tax) estimated charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC, recorded in disallowance and abandonment of utility plant on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a condition of the December 2020 ruling, EGTS filed its proposed accounting entries and supporting documentation with the FERC during the second quarter of 2021. During the finalization of these entries, EGTS refined the estimated charge for disallowance of capitalized AFUDC, which resulted in a reduction to the estimated charge of million million after-tax) that was recorded in disallowance and abandonment of utility plant on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the second quarter of 2021. In September 2021, the FERC approved EGTS' accounting entries and supporting documentation. 
 
 In December 2014, EGTS entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC ("Atlantic Cost Pipeline") for the project previously intended for EGTS to provide approximately decatherms ("Dth") of firm transmission service to various customers in connection with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project ("Supply Header Project"). As a result of the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, in the second quarter of 2020 EGTS recorded a charge of million million after-tax) in disallowance and abandonment of utility plant on the Consolidated Statement of Operations associated with the probable abandonment of a significant portion of the project as well as the establishment of a million ARO. In the third quarter of 2020, EGTS recorded an additional charge of million million after-tax) associated with the probable abandonment of a significant portion of the project and a million million after-tax) benefit from a revision to the previously established ARO, both of which were recorded in disallowance and abandonment of utility plant on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As EGTS evaluates its future use, approximately million remains within property, plant and equipment for a potential modified project.

The terms of the new notes are substantially similar to the terms of the original Eastern Energy Gas notes. The debt exchange was a common control transaction accounted for as a debt modification. As such, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and approximately million of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs and million of deferred losses on previously settled interest rate swaps remaining in AOCI were contributed to EGTS by Eastern Energy Gas in connection with the transaction. In addition, new fees of million paid directly to note holders in connection with the exchange were deferred as additional debt issuance costs that will be amortized over the lives of the respective notes. As a result of the transaction, EGTS' billion of long-term indebtedness to Eastern Energy Gas was cancelled in full and the remaining balance was satisfied through a capital contribution.

 Subsequent to the GT S Transaction 
 
 Defined Benefit Plans 
 
 Subsequent to the GT S Transaction, EGTS is a participant in benefit plans sponsored by MidAmerican Energy, an affiliate. The MidAmerican Energy Company Retirement Plan includes a qualified pension plan that provides pension benefits for eligible employees. The MidAmerican Energy Company Welfare Benefit Plan provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees on behalf of EGTS. EGTS made million, million and million of contributions to the MidAmerican Energy Company Retirement Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. EGTS made million, million and million of contributions to the MidAmerican Energy Company Welfare Benefit Plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contributions related to these plans are reflected as net periodic benefit cost in operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts attributable to EGTS were allocated from MidAmerican Energy in accordance with the intercompany administrative service agreement. Offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded related to the amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs that will be included in regulated rates. 
 
 Defined Contribution Plan 
 
 EGTS participates in the BHE GT S defined contribution employee savings plan subsequent to the GT S Transaction. EGTS' matching contributions are based on each participant's level of contribution. Contributions cannot exceed the maximum allowable for tax purposes. EGTS' contributions to the 401(k) plan were million and million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively

 Defined Benefit Plans 
 
 Prior to the GT S Transaction, certain EGTS employees not represented by collective bargaining units were covered by the Dominion Energy Pension Plan, a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by DEI that provides benefits to multiple DEI subsidiaries. As participating employers, EGTS was subject to DEI's funding policy, which was to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. EGTS' net periodic pension credit related to this plan was million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflected in operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The funded status of various DEI subsidiary groups and employee compensation are the basis for determining the share of total pension costs for participating DEI subsidiaries. 
 
 Prior to the GT S Transaction, certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits for EGTS employees not represented by collective bargaining units were covered by the Dominion Energy Retiree Health and Welfare Plan, a plan sponsored by DEI that provides certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits to multiple DEI subsidiaries. EGTS' net periodic benefit credit related to this plan was million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflected in operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Before entering into a transaction, EGTS analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, EGTS enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, EGTS exercises rights under these arrangements, including calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement.

 Money market mutual funds Equity securities: Investment funds As of December 31, 2021 Assets: Equity securities: Investment funds 
 
 EGTS' investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value. When available, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used to record the fair value. 
 
 Derivative contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal purchase or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which EGTS transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, EGTS uses forward price curves. Forward price curves represent EGTS' estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates. EGTS bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent brokers, exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by EGTS. Market price quotations are generally readily obtainable for the applicable term of EGTS' outstanding derivative contracts; therefore, EGTS' forward price curves reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for certain natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable due to the length of the contracts. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts, as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, EGTS uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts.

 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 
 Compensation Philosophy and Overall Objectives 
 
 On April 13, 2022, Mr. William J. Fehrman resigned as PacifiCorp's Chair of the Board of Directors ("Chair") and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Mr. Scott W. Thon was elected as PacifiCorp's Chair and CEO. Neither Mr. Fehrman nor Mr. Thon received any direct compensation from PacifiCorp in 2022. PacifiCorp reimbursed its indirect parent company, BHE, for the cost of Mr. Fehrman's and Mr. Thon's time spent on matters supporting PacifiCorp, including compensation paid to them by BHE, pursuant to an intercompany administrative services agreement among BHE and its subsidiaries. 
 
 PacifiCorp believes that the compensation paid to each of its Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and its other most highly compensated executive officers, to whom PacifiCorp refers collectively as its Named Executive Officers, or NEOs, should be closely aligned with PacifiCorp's overall performance, and each NEO's contribution to that performance, on both a short- and long-term basis, and that such compensation should be sufficient to attract and retain highly qualified leaders who can create significant value for the organization. PacifiCorp's compensation programs are designed to provide its NEOs meaningful incentives for superior corporate and individual performance. Performance is evaluated on a subjective basis within the context of both financial and non-financial objectives, among which are customer service, employee commitment, environmental respect, regulatory integrity, operational excellence and financial strength, which PacifiCorp believes contribute to its long-term success. 
 
 How Compensation is Determined 
 
 PacifiCorp's compensation committee consists solely of the Chair and CEO. The Chair and CEO is responsible for the establishment and oversight of PacifiCorp's compensation policy and for approving compensation decisions for its NEOs, such as approving base pay increases, incentive and performance awards, off-cycle pay changes, and participation in other employee benefit plans and programs. 
 
 PacifiCorp's criteria for assessing executive performance and determining compensation in any year is inherently subjective and is not based upon specific formulas or weighting of factors. PacifiCorp does not specifically use other companies as benchmarks when establishing its NEOs' compensation. 
 
 475 

Discussion and Analysis of Specific Compensation Elements 
 
 Base Salary 
 
 PacifiCorp determines base salaries for all of its NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, by reviewing its overall performance, and each NEO's performance, the value each NEO brings to PacifiCorp and general labor market conditions. Base salary is intended to compensate NEOs for services rendered during the fiscal year and to provide sufficient cash income for retention and recruitment purposes. While base salary provides a base level of compensation intended to be competitive with the external market, the annual base salary adjustment for each NEO, other than the Chair and CEO, is determined on a subjective basis after consideration of these factors and is not based on target percentiles or other formal criteria. All merit increases are approved by the Chair and CEO and take effect in the last payroll period of the year. An increase or decrease in base salary may also result from a promotion or other significant change in an NEO's responsibilities during the year. For 2022, base salaries for all NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, increased on average by 2.27 effective December 26, 2021, reflecting merit increases. 
 
 Short-Term Incentive Compensation 
 
 The objective of short-term incentive compensation is to reward the achievement of significant annual corporate and business unit goals while also providing NEOs with competitive total cash compensation. 
 
 Annual Incentive Plan 
 
 Under PacifiCorp's Annual Incentive Plan, or AIP, all NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, are eligible to earn an annual discretionary cash incentive award, which is determined on a subjective basis at the Chair and CEO's sole discretion and is not based on a specific formula or cap. The Chair and CEO considers a variety of factors in determining each NEO's annual incentive award including the NEO's performance, PacifiCorp's overall performance and each NEO's contribution to that overall performance. The Chair and CEO evaluates performance using financial and non-financial objectives, including customer service, employee commitment, environmental respect, regulatory integrity, operational excellence and financial strength, as well as the NEO's response to issues and opportunities that arise during the year. No factor was individually material to the Chair and CEO's determination regarding the amounts paid to each NEO under the AIP for 2022. Approved awards are paid prior to year-end. 
 
 Performance Awards 
 
 In addition to the annual awards under the AIP, PacifiCorp may grant cash performance awards periodically during the year to one or more NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, to reward the accomplishment of significant non-recurring tasks or projects. These awards are discretionary and are approved by the Chair and CEO. In 2022, a cash performance award was granted to Ms. Kobliha in recognition of her outstanding efforts. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
 
 The objective of long-term incentive compensation is to retain NEOs, reward their exceptional performance and motivate them to create long-term, sustainable value. PacifiCorp's current long-term incentive compensation program is cash-based. PacifiCorp does not utilize stock options or other forms of equity-based awards. 
 
 476 

Long-Term Incentive Partnership Plan 
 
 The PacifiCorp Long-Term Incentive Partnership Plan, or LTIP, is designed to retain key employees and to align PacifiCorp's interests and the interests of the participating employees. All of PacifiCorp's NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, participate in the LTIP. The LTIP provides for annual discretionary awards based upon significant accomplishments by the individual participants and the achievement of the financial and non-financial objectives previously described. The goals are developed with the objective of being attainable with a sustained, focused and concerted effort and are determined and communicated by January of each plan year. The BHE Chair and PacifiCorp's Presidents approve eligibility to participate in the LTIP and the amount of the incentive award. Awards are finalized in the first quarter of the following year. PacifiCorp's Presidents may participate in the LTIP but only the BHE Chair shall make determinations regarding their participation and the value of their incentive award. These cash-based awards are subject to mandatory deferral and equal annual vesting over a four-year period starting in the performance year. Participants allocate the value of their deferral accounts among various investment alternatives. Gains or losses may be incurred based on investment performance. Participating NEOs may elect to defer all or a part of the award or receive payment in cash after the four-year mandatory deferral and vesting period. Vested balances (including any investment gains or losses thereon) of terminating participants are paid at the time of termination. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 PacifiCorp's Executive Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan, or DCP, provides a means for all NEOs, other than the Chair and CEO, to make voluntary deferrals of up to 50 of base salary and 100 of short-term incentive compensation awards. PacifiCorp includes the DCP as part of the participating NEO's overall compensation in order to provide a comprehensive, competitive package. The deferrals and any investment returns grow on a tax-deferred basis. Amounts deferred under the DCP receive a rate of return based on the returns of any combination of various investment alternatives offered under the DCP and selected by the participant. The plan allows participants to choose from three forms of distribution. The plan permits PacifiCorp to make discretionary contributions on behalf of participants. 
 
 Potential Payments Upon Termination 
 PacifiCorp's NEOs are generally not entitled to severance or enhanced benefits upon termination of employment or change in control. None of PacifiCorp's NEOs have an employment agreement; therefore, payments upon termination are determined by the applicable plan documents and our general employment policies and practices as discussed below. 
 
 Compensation Committee Report 
 
 Mr. Thon, PacifiCorp's current Chair and CEO and sole member of PacifiCorp's compensation committee, has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on his review, has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 The ultimate payouts of LTIP awards are undeterminable as the amounts to be paid out may increase or decrease depending on investment performance. BHE's Chair and PacifiCorp's Presidents establish the award categories for determining LTIP awards based on net income target goals or other criteria. In 2022, the gross award was subjectively determined at the discretion of the BHE Chair and PacifiCorp's Presidents based on the overall achievement of PacifiCorp's financial and non-financial objectives including customer service, employee commitment and safety, environmental respect, regulatory integrity, operational excellence and financial strength. 
 (2) Amounts are based upon the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of all qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans, which includes the Retirement Plan. For Mr. Bird and Ms. Kobliha, such change was negative (23,432) and (69,705), respectively). Refer to the Pension Benefits table below for a discussion of the assumptions used in calculating these amounts. No participant in PacifiCorp's nonqualified deferred compensation plans earned "above market" or "preferential" earnings on amounts deferred. 
 (3) Amounts consist of PacifiCorp K Plus Employee Savings Plan, or 401(k) Plan, contributions PacifiCorp paid on behalf of the NEOs, except for Mr. Hoogeveen for whom PacifiCorp also includes an amount paid for a tax gross-up with respect to a personal benefit with a value less than 10,000. 
 (4) Any amounts voluntarily deferred by the NEO, if applicable, are included in the appropriate column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 (5) In 2022, PacifiCorp reimbursed BHE 118,237 for the cost of Mr. Fehrman's time spent on matters supporting PacifiCorp pursuant to the intercompany administrative services agreement. 
 478 

(6) On April 13, 2022, Mr. William J. Fehrman resigned as PacifiCorp's Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Scott W. Thon was elected as PacifiCorp's Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. 
 (7) In 2022, PacifiCorp reimbursed BHE 145,283 for the cost of Mr. Thon's time spent on matters supporting PacifiCorp pursuant to the intercompany administrative services agreement. 
 Pension Benefits 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the defined benefit pension plan accounts held by each of PacifiCorp's NEOs as of December 31, 2022: 
 Number of years of Present value of Name Plan name credited service accumulated benefits (1) 
 Scott W. Thon n/a n/a n/a William J. Fehrman n/a n/a n/a Stefan A. Bird Retirement 10 years 200,512 Gary W. Hoogeveen n/a n/a n/a Nikki L. Kobliha Retirement 12 years 98,895 

(1) Amounts are computed using assumptions, other than the expected retirement age, consistent with those used in preparing the related pension disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are as of December 31, 2022, which is the measurement date for the plans. The expected retirement age assumption has been determined in accordance with Instruction 2 to Item 402(h)(2) of Regulation S-K. For the Retirement Plan calculations of the present value of accumulated benefits, the following assumptions were used: 60 lump sum payment; 40 joint and 100 survivor annuity if participant is married and 40 single life annuity if participant is single. The present value assumptions used in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits for the Retirement Plan were as follows: a discount rate of 5.55 ; an expected retirement age of 65; cash balance interest crediting assumption of 5.43 for 2023 and 2024, and 2.60 thereafter; postretirement mortality using the Pri-2012 gender specific tables; generational mortality improvements from 2012 forward based on MP-2021; and the applicable lump sum interest and mortality rates set forth in IRC 417(e)(3) for the upcoming fiscal year. 
 Historically, the majority of PacifiCorp's employees were entitled to participate in PacifiCorp's Retirement Plan, other than employees subject to collective bargaining agreements that do not provide for coverage under the Retirement Plan. Through May 31, 2007, participants earned benefits at retirement payable for life based on length of service through May 31, 2007 and average pay in the 60 consecutive months of highest pay out of the 120 months prior to May 31, 2007. Pay for this purpose included base salary and annual incentive plan payments up to 10 of base salary, but was limited to the amounts specified in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17). Benefits were based on 1.3 of final average pay plus 0.65 of final average pay in excess of covered compensation (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(1)(5)(E)) multiplied by years of service. 
 
 The Retirement Plan was amended effective June 1, 2007 to change from a traditional final average pay formula as described above to a cash balance formula for non-union participants. Benefits under the final average pay formula were frozen as of May 31, 2007, and no future benefits will accrue under that formula for non-union participants. Under the cash balance formula, benefits are based on pay credits to each participant's account of 6.5 (5.0 for employees hired after June 30, 2006 and before January 1, 2008) of eligible compensation. In addition, through August 1, 2009, there was a pay credit of 4 of eligible compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base. Interest is also credited to each participant's account. Employees who were age 40 or older as of May 31, 2007 received certain additional transition pay credits for five years from the effective date of the Retirement Plan restatement. 
 
 Participants in the Retirement Plan are entitled to receive full benefits upon retirement on or after age 65. Such participants are also entitled to receive reduced benefits upon early retirement after age 55 with at least five years of service or when age plus years of service equals 75. 
 
 The Retirement Plan was closed to non-union employees hired after December 31, 2007 (which includes Mr. Hoogeveen, Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Thon). In 2008, non-union employee participants in the Retirement Plan were offered the option to continue to receive pay credits in the Retirement Plan or receive equivalent fixed contributions to the 401(k) Plan with any such election becoming effective January 1, 2009. Ms. Kobliha elected the equivalent fixed 401(k) contribution option and, therefore, no longer receives pay credits in the Retirement Plan. In 2017, the Retirement Plan was frozen for the remainder of the non-union employees who had participated (which includes Mr. Bird) with pay credits equivalent to those received in the Retirement Plan allocated into the 401(k) Plan. Mr. Bird and Ms. Kobliha continue to receive interest credits in the Retirement Plan.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the nonqualified deferred compensation plan accounts held by each of PacifiCorp's NEOs as of December 31, 2022: 
 Executive Registrant Aggregate Aggregate Aggregate contributions contributions earnings/(losses) withdrawals/ balance as of Name in 2022 (1)(2) 
 in 2022 in 2022 distributions 12/31/2022 (3) 
 Scott W. Thon William J. Fehrman Stefan A. Bird Gary W. Hoogeveen 330,330 (589,981) 3,607,102 Nikki L. Kobliha 333,707 (65,034) 805,545 
 
 (1) The executive contribution amount shown for Mr. Hoogeveen represents a deferral of 330,330 of his 2019 LTIP award which was deferred in 2022. 74,389 of the deferred 2019 LTIP award is included in the 2022 total compensation reported for him in the Summary Compensation Table and is not additional compensation. The remaining LTIP award was earned prior to 2022. 
 (2) The executive contribution amount shown for Ms. Kobliha represents a deferral of 140,093 of her 2022 compensation and a deferral of 193,614 of her 2019 LTIP award which was deferred in 2022. 12,895 of the deferred 2019 LTIP award is included in the 2022 total compensation reported for her in the Summary Compensation Table and is not additional compensation. The remaining LTIP award was earned prior to 2022. 
 (3) The aggregate balance as of December 31, 2022, shown for Mr. Hoogeveen and Ms. Kobliha includes 567,702 and 136,703, respectively, of compensation previously reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 Eligibility for PacifiCorp's DCP is restricted to select management and highly compensated employees. The plan provides tax benefits to eligible participants by allowing them to defer compensation on a pretax basis, thus reducing their current taxable income. Deferrals and any investment returns grow on a tax-deferred basis, thus participants pay no income tax until they receive distributions. The DCP permits participants to make a voluntary deferral of up to 50 of base salary and 100 of short-term incentive compensation awards. All deferrals are net of social security taxes. Amounts deferred under the DCP receive a rate of return based on the returns of any combination of various investment alternatives offered by the plan and selected by the participant. Gains or losses are calculated daily, and returns are posted to accounts based on participants' fund allocation elections. Participants can change their fund allocations as of the end of any day on which the market is open. 
 
 The DCP allows participants to maintain three accounts based upon when they want to receive payments: retirement account, in-service account and education account. Both the retirement and in-service accounts can be distributed as lump sums or in up to 10 annual installments, except in the case of the four DCP transition accounts that allow for a grandfathered payout based on the previous deferred compensation plan distribution elections of lump sum, 5, 10 or 15 annual installments. Effective December 31, 2006, no new money may be deferred into the DCP transition accounts. The education account is distributed in four annual installments. If a participant leaves employment prior to retirement (age 55), all amounts in the participant's account will be paid out in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable. Participants are 100 vested in their deferrals and any investment gains or losses recorded in their accounts. 
 
 Participants in PacifiCorp's LTIP also have the option of deferring all or a part of those awards after the four-year mandatory deferral and vesting period. The provisions governing the deferral of LTIP awards are similar to those described for the DCP above. 
 
 Potential Payments Upon Termination 
 
 PacifiCorp's NEOs are not generally entitled to severance or enhanced benefits upon termination of employment or change in control. None of PacifiCorp's NEOs have an employment agreement; therefore, payments upon termination are determined by the applicable plan documents and our general employment policies and practices as discussed below. 
 
 The following table sets forth the estimated increase in the present value of benefits pursuant to the termination scenarios indicated for PacifiCorp's NEOs, other than Mr. Thon. Payments or benefits that are not enhanced in form or amount upon the occurrence of a particular termination scenario, which include 401(k) and nonqualified deferred compensation account balances and those portions of long-term incentive payments that would have otherwise been paid, are not included herein. All estimated payments reflected in the table below assume termination on December 31, 2022 and are payable as lump sums unless otherwise noted.

Kobliha: Retirement, Voluntary and Involuntary With or Without Cause Death and Disability 228,678 
 
 (1) Amounts represent the unvested portion of each NEO's LTIP account, which becomes 100 vested under certain circumstances. 
 (2) Pension values represent the excess of the present value of benefits payable under each termination scenario over the amount already reflected in the Pension Benefits table. 
 Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
 
 PacifiCorp's CEO receives no direct compensation from PacifiCorp, and no amounts are reported for the CEO in the Summary Compensation Table. Accordingly, PacifiCorp has determined that the CEO pay ratio is not calculable. 
 
 Director Compensation 
 
 PacifiCorp's directors do not receive additional compensation for service as directors of PacifiCorp. Compensation information for Messrs. Thon, Fehrman, Bird, Hoogeveen, and Ms. Kobliha for their services as executive officers of PacifiCorp is described above. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 
 Mr. Thon is PacifiCorp's Chair and CEO. None of PacifiCorp's executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any company that has an executive officer serving as a member of PacifiCorp's Board of Directors. None of PacifiCorp's executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any company (other than BHE) that has an executive officer serving as a member of PacifiCorp's compensation committee.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 
 
 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY, MIDAMERICAN FUNDING, MIDAMERICAN ENERGY, NEVADA POWER, SIERRA PACIFIC, EASTERN ENERGY GAS AND EGTS 
 
 Information required by Item 13 is omitted pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(c) to Form 10-K. 
 
 PACIFICORP 
 
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
 
 The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the BHE Code of Business Conduct, or the Codes, which apply to all of PacifiCorp's directors, officers and employees and those of its subsidiaries, generally govern the review, approval or ratification of any related-person transaction. A related-person transaction is one in which PacifiCorp or any of its subsidiaries participate and in which one or more of PacifiCorp's directors, executive officers, holders of more than five percent of its voting securities or any of such persons' immediate family members have a direct or indirect material interest. 
 
 Under the Codes, all of PacifiCorp's directors and executive officers (including those of its subsidiaries) must disclose to PacifiCorp's legal department any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict with its interests. No action may be taken with respect to such transaction or relationship until approved by the legal department. For PacifiCorp's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, prior approval for any such transaction or relationship must be given by Berkshire Hathaway's audit committee. In addition, prior legal department approval must be obtained before a director or executive officer can accept employment, offices or board positions in other for-profit businesses, or engage in his or her own business that raises a potential conflict or appearance of conflict with PacifiCorp's interests. 
 
 Under an intercompany administrative services agreement PacifiCorp has entered into with BHE and its other subsidiaries, the costs of certain administrative services provided by BHE to PacifiCorp or by PacifiCorp to BHE, or shared with BHE and other subsidiaries, are directly charged or allocated to the entity receiving such services. This agreement has been filed with the regulatory commissions in the states where PacifiCorp serves retail customers. PacifiCorp also provides an annual report of all transactions with its affiliates to its state regulatory commissions, who have the authority to refuse recovery in rates for payments PacifiCorp makes to its affiliates deemed to have the effect of subsidizing the separate business activities of BHE or its other subsidiaries. 
 
 Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding related party transactions. 
 
 Director Independence 
 
 Because PacifiCorp's common stock is indirectly, wholly owned by BHE and its Board of Directors consists of BHE and PacifiCorp employees, PacifiCorp is not required to have independent directors or audit, nominating or compensation committees consisting of independent directors. 
 
 Based on the standards of the New York Stock Exchange LLC, on which the common stock of PacifiCorp's ultimate parent company, Berkshire Hathaway, is listed, PacifiCorp's Board of Directors has determined that none of its directors are considered independent because of their employment by BHE or PacifiCorp.

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
 
 The following table shows the fees paid or accrued by each Registrant for audit and audit-related services and fees paid for tax and all other services rendered by Deloitte Touche LLP (PCAOB ID No. ), the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates (collectively, the "Deloitte Entities") for each of the last two years (in millions):

 (1) The reported fees for Berkshire Hathaway Energy include those fees reported for PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Funding, Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific and Eastern Energy Gas while the reported fees for MidAmerican Funding include those fees reported for MidAmerican Energy and the reported fees for Eastern Energy Gas include those fees reported for EGTS, which became an SEC registrant on July 28, 2022. 
 (2) Audit fees include fees for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and interim reviews of the quarterly financial statements for each Registrant, audit services provided in connection with required statutory audits of certain of BHE's subsidiaries and comfort letters, consents and other services related to SEC matters for each Registrant. 
 (3) Audit-related fees primarily include fees for assurance and related services for any other statutory or regulatory requirements, audits of certain employee benefit plans and consultations on various accounting and reporting matters. 
 (4) Tax fees include fees for services relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and international tax compliance, tax return preparation and tax audits. 
 
 The audit committee has considered whether the non-audit services provided to the Registrants by the Deloitte Entities impaired the independence of the Deloitte Entities and concluded that they did not. All of the services performed by the Deloitte Entities were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy adopted by the audit committee. The policy provides guidelines for the audit, audit-related, tax and other non-audit services that may be provided by the Deloitte Entities to the Registrants. The policy (a) identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the audit committee in approving services to ensure that the Deloitte Entities' independence is not impaired; (b) describes the audit, audit-related and tax services that may be provided and the non-audit services that are prohibited; and (c) sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. Under the policy, requests to provide services that require specific approval by the audit committee will be submitted to the audit committee by both the Registrants' independent auditor and BHE's Chief Financial Officer. All requests for services to be provided by the independent auditor that do not require specific approval by the audit committee will be submitted to BHE's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. BHE's Chief Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the audit committee. The audit committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by the independent auditor.

 (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period 
 
 then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Notice of Borrowing in accordance with the terms of Section 2.02, any Notice of Borrowing that requests a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing for a Base Rate Borrowing provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted.

 (b) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under 

29

(New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

 (e) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate or based on a term rate and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

 (a) Voluntary. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12 00 noon (New York City Time) on the third U.S. Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.12 and 2.16, Convert all or any part of Revolving Loans of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Revolving Loans of the other Type or of the same Type but having a new Interest Period provided , however , that any Conversion of SOFR Rate Revolving Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such SOFR Rate Revolving Loans, any Conversion of Base Rate Loans into SOFR Rate Revolving Loans shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any Revolving Loans shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Revolving Loans to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into SOFR Rate Revolving Loans, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Revolving Loan.

 (c) Failure to Convert. Each notice of Conversion given pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that is to comprise SOFR Rate Revolving Loans upon Conversion, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender if, as a 

31 

 result of the failure of the Borrower to satisfy any condition to such Conversion (including, without limitation, the occurrence of any Default), such Conversion does not occur. The Borrower s obligations under this subsection (c) shall survive the repayment of all other amounts owing to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the termination of the Commitments. 
 (d) Limitation on Certain Conversions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower may not borrow Revolving Loans at the Term SOFR Rate or Convert Revolving Loans resulting in SOFR Rate Revolving Loans at any time an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

 SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. 
 (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Term SOFR Rate) 
 (ii) other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes, subject any Recipient to any Taxes on, or change the basis of taxation of payments to any Recipient in respect of, its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or 
 (iii) impose on any Lender or the relevant market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon the good faith request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such 

32 

 Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 
 (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender promptly upon demand the amount shown as due on any such certificate. 
 (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 SECTION 2.16. Illegality . 
 If due to any Change in Law it shall become unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its SOFR Rate Revolving Loans, and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon, until such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to make SOFR Rate Revolving Loans, or to Convert outstanding Revolving Loans into SOFR Rate Revolving Loans, shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.16, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions applicable to such Lender) to designate a different Lending Office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. If such notice is given, each SOFR Rate Revolving Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be converted to a Base Rate Revolving Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such SOFR Rate Revolving Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Revolving Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Revolving Loan to such day.

 SECTION 2.17. Payments and Computations. 
 (a) The Borrower shall make each payment to be made by it hereunder not later than 1 00 P.M. (New York City Time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Agent s Account in same day funds without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.06, 2.11(c), 2.13(c), 2.15, 2.18, 2.21 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of its Lending Office to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. 
 (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder, after any applicable grace period, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower s accounts with such Lender any amount so due. 
 (c) All computations of interest based on the rate referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of the Base Rate contained in Section 1.01 shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Term SOFR Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the rate referred to in clause (iii) of the definition of the Base Rate and of commitment fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, commitment fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fees, as the case may be provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of SOFR Rate Revolving Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Termination Date shall occur on a date other than a Business Day, the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender on the next preceding Business Day prior to the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans made to the Borrower by the Lenders then outstanding. 
 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to a Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date 

34 

 such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
 SECTION 2.18. Taxes. 
 (a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.18 and for the avoidance of doubt, the term Applicable Law includes FATCA. 
 (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (d) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (i) Survival.

 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 8.01 requiring the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby that directly affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.18 and 8.04(c) (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.18(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.18(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender or the applicable Withholding Agent to the extent required by Applicable Law)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.20 as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.18, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to 

66 

 receive.
