 Unless otherwise indicated, the company, we, our, us and Phillips 66 are used in this report to refer to the businesses of Phillips 66 and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words anticipate, estimate, believe, budget, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will, would, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions often identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the headings Risk Factors and CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. 

PART I 

Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

CORPORATE STRUCTURE 
 
 Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips that separated its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the separation). Phillips 66 stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the PSX stock symbol. 
 
 Effective October 1, 2022, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our President and Chief Executive Officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. As part of the realignment, we moved the results and net assets of our Merey Sweeny vacuum distillation and delayed coker units at our Sweeny Refinery and the isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery from our Midstream segment to our Refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the Refining segment by the Marketing Specialties (M S) segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the M S segment to the Refining segment. 
 
 The segment realignment is presented for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the prior periods recast for comparability.

 Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: 
 
 1) Midstream Provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services, as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation, storage, fractionation, gathering, processing and marketing services, mainly in the United States. As a result of a merger of DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Gray Oak Holdings) on August 17, 2022, we began consolidating DCP Midstream, LLC Class A Segment; DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills). On March 9, 2022, we also completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners). See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger and Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on these transactions. This segment also includes our 16 investment in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX). 
 
 2) Chemicals Consists of our 50 equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. 
 
 3) Refining Refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, at 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. 
 
 4) Marketing Specialties Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products and renewable fuels, mainly in the United States and Europe. In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of base oils and lubricants. 
 
 Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, interest expense, our investment in research of new technologies and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets include all cash, cash equivalents and income tax-related assets. Corporate and Other also includes restructuring costs related to our business transformation.

 SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

MIDSTREAM 
 
 The Midstream segment consists of three business lines: 
 
 Transportation Transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined petroleum products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and refined petroleum products. 
 
 NGL and Other Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas and transports, fractionates and markets NGL. 
 
 NOVONIX Represents our 16 investment in NOVONIX, a company that develops technology and supplies materials for lithium-ion batteries. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our Midstream business was comprised of over 72,000 miles of crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL and natural gas pipeline systems in the United States, including those partially owned or operated by our affiliates. We owned or operated 39 refined petroleum product terminals, 36 gathering and processing plants, 19 crude oil terminals, eight fractionation facilities, six NGL terminals, a petroleum coke exporting facility and various other storage and loading facilities. 
 
 DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings Merger 
 On August 17, 2022, we announced a realignment of our economic and governance interests in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP) and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC (Gray Oak Pipeline) resulting from the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. In connection with the merger, we were delegated DCP Midstream s governance rights over DCP LP and its general partner entities, referred to as DCP Midstream Class A Segment. Additionally, Enbridge Inc., our co-venturer, was delegated governance rights over Gray Oak Pipeline, referred to as DCP Midstream Class B Segment. 
 
 In connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, our NGL and Other business includes DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. Prior to August 18, 2022, our investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were accounted for using the equity method. We account for our remaining investment in Gray Oak Pipeline, now held through DCP Midstream Class B Segment, using the equity method. 
 
 See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. 
 
 DCP LP Public Common Unit Acquisition Agreement 
 On January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership. Under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP LP and DCP Midstream, GP, LP) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive 41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The merger will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3 to 86.8 . The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of DCP LP, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of Phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding DCP LP common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. As a result, DCP LP has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of DCP LP common units. See Note 29 DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the common unit acquisition agreement.

 Phillips 66 Partners Merger 
 On March 9, 2022, we completed the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners. The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us. Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded. See Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this merger transaction.

 In connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, our indirect interest in Gray Oak Pipeline was reduced to 6.5 . See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 The Dakota Access Pipeline is currently subject to litigation that could affect operations. See the Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO) section of Note 8 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this litigation. 
 
 Marine Vessels 
 At December 31, 2022, we had eight international-flagged crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL tankers under time charter contracts, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 1,100,000 barrels. Additionally, we had a variety of inland and offshore tug/barge units. These vessels are used primarily to transport crude oil and other feedstocks, as well as refined petroleum products for our refineries. In addition, the NGL tankers are used to export propane and butane from our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure. 
 
 Truck and Rail 
 Our truck and rail fleets support our feedstock and distribution operations. Rail movements are provided via a fleet of approximately 9,400 owned and leased railcars.

 NGL and Other 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our NGL and Other business was comprised of natural gas processing plants, NGL and natural gas pipeline systems, and fractionators in the United States, including those partially owned or operated by our affiliates. 
 
 Natural Gas Processing 
 DCP Midstream Class A Segment, through its subsidiary DCP LP, owned or operated 36 active natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of 5.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). At some of these facilities, we fractionate NGL into individual components (ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline). 
 
 Pipelines 
 We own a 33.33 direct interest in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills and a 43.31 indirect interest in DCP LP, which owns a 66.67 interest in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills own NGL pipeline systems that connect the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin and Midcontinent production areas to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub. 
 
 Sweeny Hub Assets 
 The Sweeny Hub is a U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub, consisting of four fractionators with a total fractionation nameplate capacity of 550,000 BPD, a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) export terminal, and NGL storage caverns. The fractionators are located adjacent to our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, and supply purity ethane to the petrochemical industry and purity NGL to domestic and global markets. Raw NGL supply to the fractionators is delivered from nearby major pipelines, including the DCP Sand Hills Pipeline. The fractionators are supported by significant infrastructure including connectivity to two NGL supply pipelines, a pipeline connecting to the Mont Belvieu market hub and the Clemens Caverns storage facility with access to our LPG export terminal in Freeport, Texas.

At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 13,000 employees working toward our vision of providing energy and improving lives. 
 
 We believe maintaining and enhancing a high-performing organization is critical to our success. Our employees promote our culture and are integral to achieving our strategic goals and maximizing long-term shareholder value. We strive for continuous improvement of our high-performing organization, as we believe that our employees differentiate us in the marketplace. The human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business and that we believe are important to understand our business, include: 
 
 Safety Safety is the cornerstone of our business. We endeavor to protect the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We employ rigorous employee training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in personal safety as we strive for zero incidents. We also include safety metrics along with metrics for process safety and environmental performance in our annual bonus program to incentivize and reward safe operations.

 Culture Phillips 66 fosters behaviors that promote our culture. Our Energy in Action is a set of core behaviors embedded in all of the company s talent and business processes to drive accountability. Those behaviors include working for the greater good; creating an environment of trust; seeking different perspectives; and achieving excellence. 
 
 In addition, we believe a high level of performance can only be achieved through an inclusive culture and diverse workforce. Our executive inclusion and diversity (I D) council, chaired by our President and Chief Executive Officer and comprised of executives and business leaders, sets and monitors the execution of our inclusion and diversity strategy. Members of the I D council also serve as global sponsors of our 10 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), a network of resources that support the company s performance by proactively developing our employees in unique ways that help them realize their full potential and that align with our corporate objective of fostering a diverse workforce. These ERGs are organizations formed around a shared set of experiences and perspectives, and are focused on professional development, networking, recruiting, raising cultural awareness, and community involvement.

When last administered in 2021, we expanded the scope of the survey to include assessments of Our Energy in Action and a culture of inclusion. In 2022, we conducted two global pulse surveys to gauge employee sentiment around our business transformation initiatives. Survey results helped us address gaps in understanding, gain alignment and better demonstrate our progress. Starting in 2023, we are transitioning to quarterly surveys instead of a biennial survey to enable us to capture real-time feedback on metrics such as employee engagement, manager effectiveness, performance enablement and our culture. 
 
 Capability We strive to build depth and breadth in our skills. We drive employee development through technical training and providing opportunities for job rotations, as well as assisting employees with obtaining and sharpening managerial skills through targeted development programs and promotional moves. Our performance management process identifies coaching and training needs. 
 
 We also have a robust succession planning practice and work each year to identify successors for certain positions within the company. As part of the process, quarterly sessions are held with executives to monitor and guide leadership development for our key corporate positions. 
 
 Performance We focus on delivering exceptional, sustainable results. We work towards retention of top talent and have advanced the effectiveness of our performance management process by embedding Our Energy in Action into the process so that we drive desired behaviors. Additionally, High Performing Organization is one of the metrics used in our variable cash incentive program. Measures used are foundational metrics, such as employee engagement and I D efforts, talent attraction, retention and development, as well as our organization s ability to adapt and respond to changing market conditions or other external factors.

 At December 31, 2022, we held a total of 517 active patents in 22 countries worldwide, including 405 active U.S. patents. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license or franchise. 
 
 In support of our goal to attain zero incidents, we have implemented a comprehensive Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system to support consistent management of HSE risks across our enterprise. The management system is designed to ensure that personal safety, process safety, and environmental impact risks are identified, and mitigation steps are taken to reduce the risk. The management system requires periodic audits to ensure compliance with government regulations, as well as our internal requirements. Our commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in annual goal setting and performance measurement. 
 
 We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. In addition, various states have authority under the federal statutes and many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violating these laws and regulations. The material effects of compliance with these government regulations upon our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position are primarily associated with environmental regulations. See the environmental information contained in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Contingencies under the captions Environmental and Climate Change. It includes information on expensed and capitalized environmental costs for 2022 and those expected for 2023 and 2024.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Manufacturing and Operations 
 
 Our financial results are affected by changing commodity prices and margins for refined petroleum, petrochemical and plastics products. 
 
 Our financial results are largely affected by the relationship, or margin, between the prices at which we sell refined petroleum, petrochemical and plastics products and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks used in manufacturing these products. Historically, margins have been volatile, and we expect they will continue to be volatile in the future. 
 
 The costs of feedstocks and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply and demand, which are subject to, among other things, production levels, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth of economies, and governmental regulation. We do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude we process. The prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate based on global, regional and local market conditions, as well as by type and class of products, which can reduce margins and have a significant impact on our refining, wholesale marketing and retail operations, revenues, operating income and cash flows. Also, crude oil supply contracts generally have market-based pricing provisions. We normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products. We also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers. Changes in prices that occur between the time we purchase feedstocks or products and when we sell the refined petroleum products could have a significant effect on our financial results. 
 
 The price of crude oil also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products and the feedstocks used to manufacture the products. Our Chemicals segment uses feedstocks that are derivatively produced in the refining of crude oil and the processing of natural gas, and those feedstock prices can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in worldwide energy prices and the supply and availability of the feedstocks. Due to the highly competitive nature of most of the products sold by our Chemicals segment, market position cannot necessarily be protected by product differentiation or by passing on cost increases to customers. As a result, price increases in raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices at which petrochemical and plastics products are sold, thereby negatively affecting margins and the results of operations of our Chemicals segment. 
 
 Sustained or prolonged declines in commodity prices and margins for our products may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, access to the capital markets, and our ability to fund our capital priorities, including share repurchases and dividends. 
 
 Market conditions, including commodity prices, may impact the earnings, financial condition and cash flows of our Midstream business. 
 
 Our Midstream business is affected by the price of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL, which have historically been volatile. The prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGL depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally, and governmental regulations. Decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. Sustained periods of low prices can also cause producers to significantly curtail or limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGL.

 The volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported or stored in our pipelines and terminal facilities depends on the demand for and availability of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the areas serviced by our assets. A period of sustained low demand or prices for crude oil could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production, which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows. Likewise, our earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted by a period of sustained lower demand for refined petroleum products, which could lead to lower refinery utilization and result in a decrease in the volumes of refined petroleum product transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities. 
 
 The natural gas gathered, processed, transported, sold and stored by us is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end-users, including fractionation facilities. Demand for these services may be substantially reduced due to lower rates of natural gas production as a result of declining commodity prices. Commodity prices, including when ethane prices are low relative to natural gas prices, can also negatively impact throughput volumes of NGL transported, fractionated and stored. Additionally, revenues and cash flows can increase or decrease as the price of natural gas and NGL fluctuates because of certain contractual arrangements whereby natural gas is purchased for an agreed percentage of proceeds from the sale of the residue gas and/or NGL resulting from its processing activities. 
 
 Additionally, the level of production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and NGL pipelines and the asset utilization rates at our natural gas processing plants, we must continually obtain new supplies. The level of successful drilling activity and prices of, and demand for, natural gas and crude oil, as well as producers desire and ability to obtain necessary permits are some of the factors that may affect new supplies of natural gas and NGL. If we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition, throughput on our pipelines and the utilization rates of our treating and processing facilities would decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to make cash distributions. 
 
 Our operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime, business interruptions, and operational hazards, any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Our operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates. Interruptions may materially reduce productivity and thus, the profitability, of operations during and after downtime, including for planned turnarounds and scheduled maintenance activities. In the past, we and certain of our equity affiliates also have temporarily shut down facilities due to the threat of severe weather, such as hurricanes. Additionally, the availability of natural gas and electricity necessary to operate our assets can be affected by weather, pipeline interruptions, grid outages, and logistics disruptions, which may also cause us to temporarily curtail or shut down operations. Although we take precautions to ensure and enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are also subject to hazards inherent in chemicals, refining and midstream businesses, such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, labor disputes, restrictive governmental regulation or other natural or man-made disasters, such as geopolitical conflicts and acts of terrorism, including cyber intrusion. The inability to operate facilities or assets due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture, process, store or transport products. 
 
 Any casualty occurrence involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. For assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater. Damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. Should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates, it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us.

 We are subject to interruptions of supply and offtake, as well as increased costs, as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum products. 
 
 We often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities. In addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil, NGL or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. Any future widespread health crises could materially and adversely impact our business in the future. 
 
 Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts had a serious adverse impact on the economy and a material adverse effect on our business, as the demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and other refined products was significantly reduced. 
 
 Even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may result in reduced demand for our products and materially affect our business. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material. Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of such events, including the virulence of the infection, the timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and its impact on economic recovery, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations, and the general economic consequences of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 To the extent any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic adversely affected or affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described below, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions. 
 
 Competition Risks 
 
 Refining and marketing competitors that produce their own feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage. 
 
 The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Some of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. 
 
 Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of our business. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers.

 Volatility in market demand for our petrochemical and plastics products and midstream transportation services and the risk of overbuild in these industries could negatively impact the results of operations of our businesses. 
 
 We and our equity affiliates have made and continue to make significant investments to meet market demand for our products and services, such as investments in midstream infrastructure and construction of new petrochemicals facilities. Similar investments have been made, and additional investments may be made in the future, by us, our competitors or by new entrants to the markets and industries we serve. The success of these investments largely depends on the realization of anticipated market demand, and these projects typically require significant development periods, during which time demand for our products or services may change, or additional investments by competitors may be made that could result in an overbuild of supply. Any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our return on capital employed. 
 
 Strategic Performance and Future Growth Risks 
 
 Large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting expected project returns. 
 
 Our basis for approving a large-scale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable rate of return on the capital invested. We base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions including the regulatory and operating environment. For example, we are in the process of converting our San Francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility to meet growing demand for renewable fuels. Most large-scale projects take several years to complete. During this multiyear period, market conditions can change from those we forecast, and these changes could be significant. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project, and this could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed. 
 
 Plans we or our joint ventures may have to expand or construct assets or develop new technologies, and plans for our future performance are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 Certain of our plans are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable, and existing regulations will remain in place to allow for, the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. A portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our and our joint ventures ability to capture growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments. Policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, marketing and use of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups. For example, the construction or expansion of pipelines can involve numerous regulatory, permitting, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to identify or execute growth projects, and those that are identified may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, if at all. In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs or the inability to complete growth projects could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed. 
 
 In addition, our Energy Research Innovation organization works to develop new technologies focused on advancing our business, including renewable fuels research and energy transition programs. Our efforts to research and develop new technologies is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions, many of which are out of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving government regulation, the pace of changes in technology, the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale, competition from third parties in developing new technologies and the availability, timing and cost of equipment.

 Political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. 
 
 Actions of federal, state, local and international governments through legislation or regulation, executive order, permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development, and commercial restrictions could delay projects, increase costs, limit development, or otherwise reduce our profitability both in the United States and abroad. Any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations, including: 
 
 Requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations. 
 
 Further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas. 
 
 Requiring increased capital costs to construct, maintain or upgrade equipment, facilities or infrastructure. 
 
 Restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities. 
 
 In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments, which can include state oil companies and U.S. subsidiaries of those companies. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security matters. The effect of any such OFAC sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries, and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products. 
 
 Other political and economic risks include global pandemics; financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations; short-term and long-term inflationary pressures; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; supply chain disruptions; acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; limitations in the availability of labor to develop, staff and manage operations; and potentially adverse tax developments. If any of these events occur, our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 We may not be able to effectively identify, whether through acquisition, investment or development, lower-carbon opportunities on favorable terms, or at all, and failure to do so could limit our growth, our ability to participate in the energy transition, and our ability to meet our environmental goals and targets. 
 
 Part of our strategy includes capturing growth opportunities in our Emerging Energy business to further advance our participation in the energy transition and meet our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets. This strategy depends on our ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities or develop and commercialize new technologies. The number of lower-carbon opportunities may be limited, and we will compete with other energy companies for these limited opportunities, which could make them more expensive and the returns for our business less attractive and possibly cause us to refrain from making them at all. Further, certain lower-carbon opportunities will depend on technological and other advancements that may not be within our control and may not come to fruition or be economically feasible in the near term. Any new opportunities also may depend on the viability of new assets or businesses that are contingent on public policy mechanisms including investment tax credits, subsidies, renewable portfolio standards and carbon trading plans. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable energy, demand-side, and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of lower-carbon and clean energy investments generally, as well as our participation in them. If we are unable to identify and consummate acquisitions and investments, our ability to execute a portion of our growth strategy and meet our environmental goals may be impeded.

 Regulatory and Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks 
 
 Climate change and severe weather may adversely affect our and our joint ventures facilities and ongoing operations. 
 
 The potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather, as well as other chronic physical effects such as water shortages and rising sea levels, on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present. We have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks, including those that may be caused by climate change, but if any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. Examples of potential physical risks include floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires, freezing temperatures and snowstorms, as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes, to the extent available, to mitigate such risks. 
 
 We operate facilities located in coastal regions of the United States, which have been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily, or even permanently, shut down operations at those sites. For example, due to significant damages from Hurricane Ida, we shut down the Alliance Refinery. CPChem also operates facilities on the Gulf Coast and has had to temporarily shut down sites in the past as a result of hurricanes. Any extreme weather events or rising sea levels may disrupt the ability to operate our facilities located near coastal areas or to transport crude oil, refined petroleum or petrochemical and plastics products in these areas. Extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities. Finally, depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions, our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 There are certain environmental hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and our financial results. 
 
 The operation of refineries, power plants, fractionators, pipelines, terminals, gas processing facilities and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances. If any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries, pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals, or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal, other than events for which we are indemnified, we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state, local and international environmental laws or common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills. 
 
 We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things: 
 
 The discharge of pollutants into the environment. 
 
 Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and GHG emissions, as they are, or may become, regulated. 
 
 The quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels. 
 
 The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 
 
 The dismantlement and abandonment of our facilities and restoration of our properties at the end of their useful lives. 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

 To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 The adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined petroleum products we produce. 
 
 Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address GHG and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our GHG or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products. Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. 
 
 For example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted Assembly Bill 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 reduction target for GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in Senate Bill 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Additionally, on August 25, 2022, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations that effectively ban the in-state sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035. Also, on December 15, 2022, CARB adopted its 2022 Scoping Plan for Achieving Carbon Neutrality, which purports to provide a road map for California to achieve carbon neutrality (which it defines as removing as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits) by year 2045. Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Federal, regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and impose considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. Increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in heightened societal awareness and a number of international and national measures to limit GHG emissions. Additional stricter regulatory measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition. 
 
 International climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. Although the United States had previously withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, it has since taken the steps necessary to rejoin, which was effective in February 2021. The U.S. climate change strategy and the impact to our industry and operations due to GHG regulation is unknown at this time. 
 
 Increased regulation of the fossil fuel industry, particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 Most of the crude oil and gas production of our Midstream segment s customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs. These reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production. The EPA, as well as several state agencies, have commenced studies and/or convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. At the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation. In addition, some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities.

 Also, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict crude oil and natural gas development generally. If ballot initiatives, local, state, or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of crude oil and natural gas, producers may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. In addition to these proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments, municipalities, such as the City of Los Angeles, have already enacted or contemplate enacting complete or partial bans on oil and gas exploration and production activities. 
 
 If legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells and related servicing activities, it may reduce crude oil, natural gas and NGL supplies, negatively affecting the volume of products available to our Midstream segment and increasing feedstock prices for our Chemicals and Refining segments, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Compliance with the EPA s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 The EPA has implemented the RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements for the quantity of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. To provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry, a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in, or imported into, the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the EPA s RVO requirements and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. 
 
 We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RINs prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, if we purchase RINs that are ultimately determined to be invalid, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA s RVO requirements, including because the EPA mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel (a situation commonly referred to as the blend wall ), our operations could be materially adversely impacted, up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel for sale in the United States. 
 
 Societal, technological, political and scientific developments around emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels. 
 
 Developments aimed at reducing GHG emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels. Societal attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products. Government efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs of our products, thus affecting the public s attitude toward our major product. Advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleum-based transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for motor fuel. We may also incur increased production costs, which we may not be able to pass along to our customers. 
 
 Additionally, renewable fuels, alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products. Tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be, which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels. 
 
 These developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Continuing political and social concerns about the issues of climate change may result in changes to our business and significant expenditures, including litigation-related expenses. 
 
 Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, shareholder activism has recently been increasing in our industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. Additionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. began filing lawsuits against energy companies in 2017, including Phillips 66. The lawsuits seek damages allegedly associated with climate change, and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While we believe these lawsuits are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against them for lacking factual and legal merit, the ultimate outcome and impact to us of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. Additionally, governments and private parties are also increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding climate change and other Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) related matters and practices by companies are false and misleading greenwashing that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes. While we are currently not a party to any of these lawsuits, they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change or ESG disclosures and practices. Any of these risks could result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions in our operations, increases to our operating expenses and reduced demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment, consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns, or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for CPChem s plastic products and could negatively impact our equity interest. 
 
 There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics, and other packaging waste in the environment. Additionally, plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny. Policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels. In addition, a host of single-use plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the U.S. Increased regulation of, or prohibition on, the use of certain plastic products could reduce demand for certain of the products CPChem produces, which could negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, thereby negatively impacting our equity earnings, and cash distributions that we receive, from CPChem. 
 
 Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks 
 
 Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 
 
 Our information technology and infrastructure, or information technology and infrastructure of our third-party service providers (e.g., cloud-based service providers), may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including ransomware and other malware, phishing and social engineering schemes. Any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in one or more of the following outcomes: (i) a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage; (vii) reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and (viii) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, we do not believe that any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or financial condition.

 A breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (U.S. and non-U.S.). Our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans may not be able to prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. 
 
 Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Along with our own data and information collected in the normal course of our business, we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations. The transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. This data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, including data privacy and security laws such as the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 
 
 The GDPR applies to activities related to personal data that are conducted from an establishment in the EU. As interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur additional costs. Failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 The CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents specific rights in relation to their personal information, requires that companies take certain actions, including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us, directly or indirectly, from California residents. As interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 Comprehensive privacy laws with some similarities to the CCPA have been proposed or passed at the U.S. federal and state levels, such as the Colorado Privacy Act. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices. Existing data privacy laws, or any laws that may become applicable to our business, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Equity Investments and Pending Merger 
 
 Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk. 
 
 We conduct some of our operations, including parts of our Midstream, Refining and Marketing and Specialties (M S) segments, and our entire Chemicals segment, through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.

 One of our subsidiaries serves as the managing member of the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership (MLP), DCP LP, which may increase our exposure to legal liability, including with respect to our pending acquisition of the publicly held common units of DCP LP. 
 
 One of our subsidiaries acts as the managing member of the general partner of DCP LP, a publicly traded MLP, and is responsible for conducting, directing and managing all activities associated with DCP LP. Our control of the activities of DCP LP may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to DCP LP. 
 
 Additionally, our control of the general partner of DCP LP increases the possibility that we and the officers and directors of the general partner of DCP LP could be subject to litigation related to the pending acquisition of the publicly held common units of DCP LP. While we will evaluate and defend against any lawsuits vigorously, an unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit could delay or prevent the consummation of this transaction and the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 The integration of DCP LP s operations into Phillips 66 may not be as successful as anticipated, and Phillips 66 may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the integration. 
 
 We have not previously directly managed the assets owned by DCP LP. Difficulties in integrating DCP LP into our existing midstream business may result in DCP LP and Phillips 66 performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize the operational and commercial synergies and cost savings that we expect to capture from the integration. Phillips 66 s and DCP LP s existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the integration. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors: 
 
 the inability to successfully integrate the businesses of DCP LP into Phillips 66 in a manner that permits Phillips 66 to achieve the full revenue, cost savings and synergies anticipated; 
 
 complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business; 
 
 integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services; 
 
 integrating operational and business information technology systems; 
 
 loss of key employees; 
 
 integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners; 
 
 performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management s attention caused by the integration process; and 
 
 the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. 
 
 Indebtedness, Capital Markets and Financial Risks 
 
 Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners. 
 
 Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets, which is beyond our control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, access to those markets, which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity transaction counterparties, or our customers, preventing them from meeting their obligations to us.

 From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our cash from our consolidated operations and joint venture distributions, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. 
 
 Investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels and sustainability could adversely affect our business, the market price for our common stock and our access to and cost of capital. 
 
 There have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other groups, to promote the divestment of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. If these efforts are successful, our stock price, our ability to access capital markets and our cost of capital may be negatively impacted. 
 
 Members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices, including practices related to GHG emissions, climate change, diversity and inclusion, environmental justice and other sustainability-related matters. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock or participating in our financing activities. If we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our access to capital markets and lenders may be curtailed, and our reputation may be negatively affected. 
 
 Our efforts to accurately report on sustainability-related issues expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability-related matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Processes and controls for reporting on sustainability matters are subject to evolving and disparate standards of identification, measurement, and reporting on such metrics, including any climate change and sustainability-related public company disclosure requirements adopted by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current sustainability practices and disclosures. 
 
 We do not fully insure against all potential losses, including those from extreme weather events, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected or underinsured liabilities and increased costs. 
 
 We maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent, including against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured or underinsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, including weather events, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money, limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, and could trigger co-venturer rights under joint venture arrangements. 
 
 Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, and our funding sources could decrease. 
 
 In addition, a failure by Phillips 66 to maintain an investment grade rating could affect its business relationships with suppliers and operating partners. For example, Phillips 66 s agreement with Chevron Corporation (Chevron) regarding CPChem permits Chevron to buy Phillips 66 s 50 interest in CPChem for fair market value if Phillips 66 experiences a change in control or if both Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. lower its credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter, with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks. As a result of these factors, a downgrade of credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on Phillips 66 s future operations and financial position. 
 
 The level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. 
 
 Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries. If we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care cost trend rate, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase. In addition, several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use. Funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities. 
 
 We may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and derivative transactions. 
 
 We currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to use them in the future. If the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us. 
 
 We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of ConocoPhillips following the separation. Further, ConocoPhillips has indemnified us for certain matters, but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future. 
 
 In connection with our separation from ConocoPhillips, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement and certain other agreements pursuant to which ConocoPhillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ConocoPhillips for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide are not subject to any cap and may be significant. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ConocoPhillips has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from ConocoPhillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and ConocoPhillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 
 None. 

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. Additionally, we have elected a 300,000 threshold to disclose certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental laws when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. We do not currently believe that the eventual outcome of any matters reported, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Further, our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of the Federal Clean Air Act, with the EPA, five states and one local air pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty. 
 
 New Matters 
 The EPA and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) notified Phillips 66 that the government will seek penalties for alleged violations of the 2019 consent decree (Civil Action No. 3:18-cv-01484-SMY-GCS) at our Wood River Refinery. We expect that penalties paid for the enforcement action will exceed 300,000. We are working with EPA and DOJ to resolve this matter. 
 
 Matters Previously Reported (unresolved or resolved since the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022) 
 On July 2, 2020, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) issued a demand for penalties totaling 2,697,575. The penalty demand proposes to resolve 26 Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued between 2017 and 2020 for alleged violations of air permit and air pollution regulatory requirements at the Los Angeles Refinery. We are working with SCAQMD to resolve these NOVs. 
 
 In 2018, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) issued a Compliance Advisory in relation to an improperly permitted facility flare and related air emissions from flare operations at one of DCP LP s gas processing plants, which DCP LP self-disclosed to CDPHE in December 2017. Following information exchanges and discussions with CDPHE, a resolution was proposed pursuant to which the plant s air permit would be revised, and DCP LP would be assessed an administrative penalty and economic benefit payment. A revised air permit was issued in May 2019, but the parties had not yet entered into a final settlement agreement to complete the matter. Subsequently, in July 2020, CDPHE issued a Notice of Violation in relation to amine treater emissions at this plant, which DCP LP self-disclosed to CDPHE in April 2020. DCP LP is engaging with CDPHE as to this and the flare-related matter, including possible settlement terms, although these matters, which have since been combined, may result in formal legal proceedings. It is possible that resolution of this matter may include an administrative penalty and economic benefit payment, further revisions to the facility air permit, or installation of emissions management equipment, or a combination of these, that could result in costs that exceed 1 million.

 DCP LP Public Common Unit Acquisition Agreement 
 On January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership. Under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP LP and DCP Midstream GP, LP) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive 41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The merger will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3 to 86.8 . The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of DCP LP, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of Phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding DCP LP common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. As a result, DCP LP has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of DCP LP common units. See Note 29 DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the common unit acquisition agreement. 
 
 Phillips 66 Partners Merger 
 On March 9, 2022, we completed the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners). The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us. Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded. See Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this merger transaction. 
 
 CEO Transition 
 On April 12, 2022, Greg C. Garland, announced his intention to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer of Phillips 66, effective July 1, 2022. Mr. Garland continues to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board with an expected retirement date from this position in 2024. Mark E. Lashier was promoted to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2022. 
 
 We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities: 
 
 Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. In 2022, we achieved a combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.11. 
 
 Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We continue to progress our multi-year business transformation initiative focused on identifying and implementing opportunities to improve our cost structure enterprise wide. We are executing on our initiatives to achieve a sustainable run-rate cost reduction of at least 800 million and a sustaining capital reduction of at least 200 million per year by the end of 2023. 
 
 We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2022, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84 .

 Growth. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns. Our strategy primarily focuses on investing in high-return growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments, as well as our investments in renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future. In 2023, we have budgeted 2 billion in capital expenditures and investments, which includes 1.1 billion of growth capital. Approximately 50 of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. In Midstream, we have budgeted 639 million for capital expenditures and investments, of which 310 million is for growth capital projects directed towards enhancing our integrated natural gas liquids (NGL) value chain from wellhead to market. In Refining, we have budgeted 1.1 billion for capital expenditures and investments, of which 448 million is for the continued conversion of the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California into a renewable fuels facility. 
 
 In Chemicals, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is 925 million, of which 702 million is for growth capital projects. CPChem plans to use its growth capital to fund development of its petrochemical projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar, as well as expand its propylene splitting capacity and normal alpha olefins production. 
 
 As part of our strategy to grow our Midstream NGL business, on January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units of DCP LP, which will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3 to 86.8 at closing. This transaction will be accounted for as an equity transaction and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this transaction with a combination of cash and debt. 
 
 Returns. We plan to enhance Refining returns by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability, improve market capture and reduce costs. Our M S segment will continue to develop and enhance our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. 
 
 Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases. In 2022, we paid 1.8 billion of dividends on our common stock. In the second quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5 to 0.97 per common share. In the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8 to 1.05 per common share. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In the second quarter of 2022, we resumed repurchasing shares under our share repurchase program. In 2022, we repurchased 1.5 billion, or 16.6 million shares, of our common stock. On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 5 billion increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount of share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors since July 2012 to an aggregate of 20 billion. 
 
 At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we are targeting to return 10 billion to 12 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in the period from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The amount and timing of future dividend payments and the level and timing of future share repurchases will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans. 
 
 High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on promoting an inclusive workplace that enables our diverse workforce to innovate, create value and deliver extraordinary performance. We also focus on getting results in the right way and embracing our values as a common bond, and we believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company s, success.

 Business Environment 
 The Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses. Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk. Our NGL business, including DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by NGL, natural gas and condensate prices. During 2022, NGL and natural gas prices increased, compared with 2021, supported by increasing liquified natural gas exports and higher crude oil prices. 
 
 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. Compared with 2021, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin decreased significantly in 2022, due to soft demand and increasing capacity, resulting in lower plant operating rates. 
 
 Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, increased to an average of 94.44 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of 67.96 per barrel in 2021. Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Worldwide market crack spreads increased to an average of 34.26 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of 17.09 per barrel in 2021. The increases in crude oil prices and market crack spreads were primarily driven by improving demand for refined petroleum products, as economic activities gradually recovered as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic moderated, as well as tightening supply due to the Russia-Ukraine war and refinery closures that occurred during the pandemic. 
 
 Results for our M S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined petroleum products. While marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by trends in spot prices, and where applicable, retail prices for refined petroleum products in the regions and countries where we operate.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 Effective August 18, 2022, forward, in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings we began consolidating the results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. As a result of this transaction, we began presenting the results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment within the results of our NGL and Other business. Prior periods also have been updated to reflect the results of our equity investment in DCP Midstream prior to August 18, 2022, within the results of our NGL and Other business. See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, Note 4 Business Combination, and Note 18 Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. 
 
 Effective October 1, 2022, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our President and Chief Executive Officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. As part of the realignment, we moved the results and net assets of our Merey Sweeny vacuum distillation and delayed coker units at our Sweeny Refinery and the isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery from our Midstream segment to our Refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the Refining segment by the M S segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the M S segment to the Refining segment. Further, we are no longer presenting disaggregated business line results for our Chemicals and M S segments to align with changes in our internal financial reporting. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2022, we began reporting our investment in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX) as a separate business line within our Midstream segment. Previously it was included in our NGL and Other business line. 
 
 The segment realignment and business line reporting changes are presented for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the prior periods recast for comparability.

 2022 vs. 2021 
 
 Net income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 11,024 million, compared with 1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, an aggregate before-tax gain of 3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, lower impairments in the Refining segment, and improved international marketing fuel margins. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense, lower equity earnings from CPChem, and an unrealized decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX. 
 
 2021 vs. 2020 
 
 Net income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 1,317 million, compared with net loss attributable to Phillips 66 of 3,975 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement was primarily due to lower impairments, improved realized refining margins and higher equity earnings from CPChem, partially offset by income tax impacts from improved results.

 Statement of Operations Analysis 
 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 
 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 52 and 47 , respectively, in 2022. These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. 
 
 Other income increased 2,283 million in 2022, primarily due to an aggregate gain of 3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. The impact of this gain was partially offset by an unrealized investment loss on our investment in NOVONIX, compared with an unrealized gain in 2021. See Note 4 Business Combination, and Note 18 Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the aggregate gain. See Note 8 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our investment in NOVONIX. 
 
 Operating expenses increased 19 in 2022, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased natural gas and power prices and higher turnaround and other maintenance expenses. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24 in 2022, primarily driven by higher employee-related expenses, restructuring costs due to our business transformation and increased selling expenses driven by rising refined petroleum product prices. 
 
 Impairments decreased 96 in 2022 primarily due to a before-tax impairment of 1,298 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our Alliance Refinery. See Note 11 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 29 in 2022, primarily due to tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in the third quarter of 2021, as well as higher property and other taxes. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 3,102 million in 2022 primarily due to improved results. See Note 23 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 32 in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills, which resulted in us reflecting the additional noncontrolling interest owned by the public common and preferred unitholders of DCP LP, as well as Enbridge s noncontrolling interest in DCP Midstream Class A Segment, on our consolidated statement of operations. The increase was partially offset by a decrease due to the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners that occurred in the first quarter of 2022 and resulted in Phillips 66 Partners becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66. See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, and Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings and the Phillips 66 Partners merger, respectively.

 2021 vs. 2020 
 
 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 74 and 77 , respectively, in 2021. These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL, as well as increased volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil. 
 
 Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 1,713 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from CPChem mainly driven by increased margins, WRB Refining LP (WRB) resulting from improved realized refining margins and higher refinery production, and Excel Paralubes LLC (Excel Paralubes) attributable to higher base oil margins. See Chemicals segment analysis in the Segment Results section for additional information on CPChem. 
 
 Net gain on dispositions decreased 83 in 2021, mainly reflecting a before-tax gain of 84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. See Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Other income increased 388 million in 2021, primarily driven by an unrealized gain of 365 million related to the change in fair value of our investment in NOVONIX, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 8 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our investment in NOVONIX. 
 
 Operating expenses increased 13 in 2021, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased commodity prices, higher employee-related expenses, and increased maintenance and repair costs. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 in 2021, primarily driven by higher selling expenses due to rising refined petroleum product prices and demand, increased employee-related expenses, and a benefit received from a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2020. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 15 in 2021, mainly due to asset retirements related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery. See Note 9 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding asset retirements related to the Alliance Refinery. 
 
 Impairments decreased 65 in 2021. See Note 11 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding impairments. 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes decreased 12 in 2021, primarily driven by tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in 2021, and lower property and franchise taxes. 
 
 Interest and debt expense increased 16 in 2021, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, as well as higher average debt principal balances resulting from new debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020. 
 
 We had income tax expense of 146 million in 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of 1,250 million in 2020, primarily due to before-tax income in 2021 versus a before-tax loss in 2020.

 Results from our Midstream segment increased 3,234 million in 2022, compared with 2021. 
 
 Results from our Transportation business increased 498 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to a before-tax impairment of 198 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to Phillips 66 Partners decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, a before-tax gain of 182 million from the transfer of a 35.75 indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer as part of the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, and lower depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the Alliance Refinery to a terminal. 
 
 Results from our NGL and Other business increased 3,548 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to before-tax gains totaling 2,831 million recognized from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. Additionally, the increased results reflect the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, as well as improved Sweeny Hub results. 
 
 In 2022, the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX decreased by 442 million compared with an increase of 370 million in 2021. We acquired this investment in September 2021.

 Midstream s results increased 1,616 million in 2021, compared with 2020. 
 
 Results from our Transportation business increased 170 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from our equity affiliates, lower asset impairments, and increased pipeline volumes and tariffs. These increases were partially offset by a before-tax gain of 84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, and increased depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the Alliance Refinery to a terminal. 
 
 Results from our NGL and Other business increased 1,076 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase in 2021 reflects a 1,161 million before-tax impairment of our investment in DCP Midstream recorded in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher utility costs due to increased natural gas prices. 
 
 The fair value of our investment in NOVONIX increased 370 million in 2021, compared with 2020. We acquired this investment in September 2021. 
 
 See Note 11 Impairments, Note 30 Phillips 66 Partners LP and Note 8 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on impairments, the before-tax gain and our investment in NOVONIX, respectively.

Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent) 91 95 99 

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. CPChem produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. CPChem manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene, as well as manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 interest in CPChem. 
 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 
 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased 988 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins driven by decreased sale prices, higher feedstock and utility costs, as well as decreased results from CPChem s equity affiliates. 
 
 See the Executive Overview and Business Environment section for information on market factors impacting CPChem s 2022 results. 
 
 2021 vs. 2020 
 
 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment increased 1,209 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by increased sale prices reflecting strong demand and tight supply, partially offset by higher utility, turnaround, maintenance and repair costs.

The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, at 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we shut down our Alliance Refinery. 
 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 
 Results from the Refining segment increased 10,169 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The improved results were primarily due to higher realized refining margins driven by improved market crack spreads, partially offset by higher operating costs. In addition, 2021 included a before-tax impairment of 1,288 million associated with our Alliance Refinery. See Note 11 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding this impairment. 
 
 Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 and 84 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved demand for refined petroleum products due to supply constraints caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and easing of restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic.

 2021 vs. 2020 
 
 Results from the Refining segment increased 3,670 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The improved results in 2021 were primarily due to higher realized refining margins and lower asset impairments, partially offset by increased utility expenses and higher costs related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery. The improved realized refining margins in 2021 were mainly attributable to increased market crack spreads, partially offset by higher RIN costs, lower clean product differentials and decreased secondary products margins. See Note 11 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding impairments recorded in our Refining segment during 2021 and 2020. 
 
 Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84 and 76 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 was primarily driven by improved market demand for refined petroleum products following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions.

Net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Corporate overhead and other includes general and administrative expenses, technology costs, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, restructuring costs related to our business transformation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. 
 
 2022 vs. 2021 
 
 Net interest expense decreased 46 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily driven by increased interest income, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment from August 18, 2022, forward. See Note 14 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding debt. 
 
 Corporate overhead and other increased 241 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to restructuring costs associated with our business transformation for consulting fees, severance and an impairment related to assets held for sale, as well as higher employee related expenses. See Note 28 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, and Note 31 Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding restructuring costs. 
 
 2021 vs. 2020 
 
 Net interest expense increased 98 million in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, and higher average debt principal balances reflecting debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020, as well as costs associated with early debt retirement in 2021. See Note 14 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the debt repayment in 2021. 
 
 Corporate overhead and other decreased 5 million in 2021, compared with 2020.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Financial Indicators 
 
 Millions of Dollars, Except as Indicated 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents 6,133 3,147 2,514 Net cash provided by operating activities 10,813 6,017 2,111 Short-term debt 529 1,489 987 Total debt 17,190 14,448 15,893 Total equity 34,106 21,637 21,523 Percent of total debt to capital 34 40 42 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 3 12 Capital includes total debt and total equity. 

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing. During 2022, we generated 10.8 billion in cash from operations. We used available cash to pay down 2.4 billion in debt, fund capital expenditures and investments of 2.2 billion, pay dividends on our common stock of 1.8 billion and repurchase 1.5 billion of our common stock. During 2022, cash and cash equivalents increased 3 billion to 6.1 billion. 
 
 Significant Sources of Capital 
 
 Operating Activities 
 During 2022, cash generated by operating activities was 10.8 billion, a 4.8 billion increase compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings resulting from improved realized refining margins, partially offset by working capital impacts and lower distributions from equity affiliates. 
 
 During 2021, cash generated by operating activities was 6 billion, a 3.9 billion increase compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved realized refining margins, a U.S. federal income tax refund of 1.1 billion received in the second quarter of 2021, and higher cash distributions from our equity affiliates, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
 
 Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 
 
 The level and quality of output from our refineries also impact our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 90 , 84 and 76 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84 , 83 and 84 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Equity Affiliate Operating Distributions 
 Our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem. Over the three years ended December 31, 2022, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of 6 billion, including 2.8 billion from CPChem. We cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.

 Tax Refunds 
 We received a U.S. federal income tax refund of 1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021. 
 
 Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper 
 
 Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company 
 
 On June 23, 2022, we entered into a new 5 billion revolving credit facility (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of June 22, 2027. The Facility replaced our previous 5 billion revolving credit facility with Phillips 66 as the borrower and Phillips 66 Company as the guarantor. The Facility contains usual and customary covenants that are similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We have the option to increase the overall capacity to 6 billion, subject to certain conditions. We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to two additional one-year terms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either (a) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin. The Facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amount had been drawn under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Phillips 66 also has a 5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility. Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to 365 days. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the program. 
 
 Phillips 66 Partners 
 
 In connection with entering into the Facility, we terminated Phillips 66 Partners 750 million revolving credit facility. 
 
 DCP Midstream Class A Segment 
 
 DCP LP has a credit facility under its amended credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a borrowing capacity of up to 1.4 billion that matures on March 18, 2027. The Credit Agreement grants DCP LP the option to increase the revolving loan commitment by an aggregate principal amount of up to 500 million and to extend the term for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to requisite lender approval. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid based on DCP LP s credit rating. At December 31, 2022, DCP LP had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, 10 million in letters of credit had been issued that are supported by the Credit Agreement. 
 
 DCP LP has an accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) that provides for up to 350 million of borrowing capacity through August 2024 at an adjusted SOFR and includes an uncommitted option to increase the total commitments under the Securitization Facility by up to an additional 400 million. Under the Securitization Facility, certain of DCP LP s wholly owned subsidiaries sell or contribute receivables to another of DCP LP s consolidated subsidiaries, DCP Receivables LLC (DCP Receivables), a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility. At December 31, 2022, 40 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Securitization Facility, which are secured by its accounts receivable at DCP Receivables.

 Term Loan Facility 
 
 In April 2021, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a 450 million term loan agreement with a one-year term and borrowed the full amount. The term loan agreement was repaid upon maturity in April 2022 without premium or penalty. 
 
 In March 2020, we entered into a 1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan agreement (the Facility) and borrowed 1 billion under the Facility shortly thereafter.

 Phillips 66 Availability of Debt Financing 
 We have an A3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard Poor s. These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or both rating agencies. Failure to maintain investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above. 
 
 DCP LP Availability of Debt Financing 
 DCP LP has a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard and Poor a BBB- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Fitch Ratings; and a Ba1 credit rating, with a positive outlook, from Moody s Investors Service. These ratings facilitate DCP LP access to a variety of lenders. DCP LP does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or more rating agencies.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Lease Residual Value Guarantees 
 Under the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of 514 million at December 31, 2022. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling 156 million. These leases have remaining terms of five to nine years. 
 
 Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO) 
 In 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The court later vacated the easement. Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021. In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed. 
 
 In February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Court) denied Dakota Access writ of certiorari requesting the Court to review the lower court s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement. Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stands. Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing. The draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and release is expected in Spring 2023. 
 
 Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access in March 2019. On April 1, 2022, Dakota Access wholly owned subsidiary repaid 650 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity. We funded our 25 share, or 163 million, with a capital contribution of 89 million in March 2022 and 74 million of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access senior unsecured notes was 1.85 billion. 
 
 In conjunction with the notes offering, Phillips 66 Partners, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU). Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation. At December 31, 2022, our 25 share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately 467 million. 
 
 If the pipeline is required to cease operations, and should Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay ongoing expenses, we could be required to support our 25 share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately 20 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU at December 31, 2022.

 Debt Exchange 
 On May 5, 2022, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, completed offers to exchange (the Exchange Offers) all validly tendered notes of seven different series of notes issued by Phillips 66 Partners (collectively, the Old Notes), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 3.5 billion, for notes issued by Phillips 66 Company (collectively, the New Notes). The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66 and rank equally with Phillips 66 Company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and the guarantees rank equally with Phillips 66 s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
 
 Old Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 3.2 billion were tendered in the Exchange Offers. The New Notes have the same interest rates, interest payment dates and maturity dates as the Old Notes. Holders that validly tendered before the end of the early participation period on April 19, 2022 (the Early Participation Date), received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount equivalent to the Old Notes, while holders that validly tendered after the Early Participation Date, but before the Expiration Date, received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount 3 less than the Old Notes. Substantially all of the Old Notes exchanged were tendered during the Early Participation Period.

 On January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership. Under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP LP and DCP Midstream GP, LP) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive 41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The merger will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3 to 86.8 . The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.

 If the merger is successfully completed, we will pay approximately 3.8 billion in cash consideration, which we expect to fund through a combination of cash generated from operating activities and debt. 
 
 The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of DCP LP, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of Phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding DCP LP common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. As a result, DCP LP has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of DCP LP common units.

 Merger with Phillips 66 Partners 
 On March 9, 2022, we completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners. The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us in exchange for 41.8 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock. Phillips 66 Partners common unitholders received 0.50 shares of Phillips 66 common stock for each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unit.

On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 5 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Since July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of 20 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we contributed 125 million to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and 23 million to our international pension plans. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, outstanding debt principal and interest obligations, operating and finance lease obligations, and asset retirement and environmental obligations. 
 
 Purchase Obligations 
 Our purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due. As of December 31, 2022, our purchase obligations totaled 106.5 billion, with 44.4 billion due within one year. 
 
 The majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. At December 31, 2022, product purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were 54.6 billion and 26.1 billion, respectively. The remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator. 
 
 Debt Principal and Interest Obligations 
 As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was 17.2 billion, with 529 million due within one year. Our obligations for interest on the debt totaled 10.2 billion, with 776 million due within one year. See Note 14 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt principal and interest obligations. 
 
 Finance and Operating Lease Obligations 
 See Note 20 Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our lease obligations and timing of our expected lease payments. 
 
 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations 
 See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding asset retirement and environmental obligations.

 Refining 
 Capital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was 2.5 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to enhance the yield of high-value products, renewable fuels projects, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects. 
 
 Key projects funded during the three-year period included: 
 Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Ponca City and Sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery. 
 
 Installation of facilities to improve product value at the Lake Charles Refinery. 
 
 Installation of facilities to produce renewable fuels at our San Francisco and Humber refineries. 
 
 Marketing and Specialties 
 Capital spending for the M S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was primarily for investment in retail marketing joint ventures in the U.S. West Coast and Central regions; the continued acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe; and acquisition of a commercial fleet fueling business in California, which will provide further placement opportunities for renewable diesel production to end-use customers. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 Capital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was primarily for information technology and facilities. 
 
 2023 Budget 
 Our 2023 capital budget is 2 billion, including 865 million for sustaining capital and 1.1 billion for growth capital. Approximately 50 of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. Our projected 2 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures CPChem and WRB totaling 1.1 billion. 
 
 The Midstream capital budget of 639 million includes a growth capital budget of 310 million which will be directed toward enhancing our integrated NGL value chain from wellhead to market. The Midstream capital budget also includes 329 million for sustaining projects. The Midstream expected spend includes 100 of DCP LP s sustaining capital of 150 million and 125 million of growth capital. In Refining, the total capital budget of 1.1 billion consists of 389 million for reliability, safety and environmental projects and 729 million for growth capital. Refining s growth capital includes the continued conversion of the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels facility. The M S capital budget of 134 million reflects the continued development and enhancement of our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. The Corporate and Other capital budget is 108 million primarily for digital transformation and information technology projects.

 Contingencies 
 
 A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain. 
 
 Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. 
 
 Legal and Tax Matters 
 Our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 23 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.

 Environmental 
 We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: 
 
 U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. 
 
 U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into bodies of water. 
 
 European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (EU REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals and the United Kingdom s legislation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (UK REACH), which replaced EU REACH in the United Kingdom in 2021 following the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union (BREXIT). 
 
 U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. 
 
 U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. 
 
 U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments. 
 
 U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the United States. 
 
 European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which replaced the EU ETS in the United Kingdom in 2021, following BREXIT. 
 
 These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. 
 
 Other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on November 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime. 
 
 The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.

 An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. RINs form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to bank them for use the following year. We have met the requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements. On December 1, 2022, the EPA proposed RVO for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 compliance years, as well as RIN generation from renewable electricity utilized as a transportation fuel (eRINs). These standards increase cellulosic volumes, which reflect the EPA s forecast for increasing eRIN volumes beginning in 2024. They also increase total advanced biofuel volumes, which reflect the EPA s forecast for increasing eRIN volumes beginning in 2024. In addition, they increase total advanced biofuel volumes from the 5.63 billion gallons established for the 2022 compliance year to 7.43 billion gallons in 2025. If adopted, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and increased program costs if not fully recovered in the market. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA s final regulations establishing RVO requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding RVO requirements. 
 
 We are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of 478 million, 441 million and 342 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries. These expenses are included in the Purchased crude oil and products line item on our consolidated statement of operations. Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was 437 million, 351 million and 133 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses are included in the Equity in earnings of affiliates line item on our consolidated statement of operations. The amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of RINs, refinery production, blending activities, and RVO requirements. 
 
 We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater and both the EPA and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities. 
 
 At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. 
 
 We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2021, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 25 sites within the United States. In 2022, we were notified of one potentially new site through a CERCLA Section 104(e) information request issued by the EPA, and four sites that were deemed resolved and closed, accordingly, leaving 22 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2022. 
 68

 For the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 
 
 We incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution. Expensed environmental costs were 728 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately 800 million in 2023 and 2024. Capitalized environmental costs were 88 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately 140 million and 250 million, in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance. 
 
 Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis). 
 
 Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. 
 
 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Climate Change 
 There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: 
 
 EU ETS, which is part of the European Union s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. As a result of the United Kingdom s exit from the EU (BREXIT), those types of entities in the United Kingdom are now subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS. 
 
 EU Renewable Energy Directive II, which increases the EU s energy consumption from renewable sources in the electricity, heat, and transportation sectors to 32 by 2030. 
 69 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

 United Kingdom s Renewable Fuel Obligation, which is intended to reduce the GHG emissions from fuel used in the United Kingdom transportation sector by encouraging the supply of renewable fuels. 
 
 California s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40 below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, California s Advanced Clean Cars and Trucks Programs, California s Carbon Neutrality by 2045 Scoping Plan, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Climate Protection Plan, and Washington's carbon reduction programs. 
 
 United States Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which is intended to accelerate the energy transition. 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. 
 
 The EPA s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA s and U.S. Department of Transportation s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. 
 
 The EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan. The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process. 
 
 Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. 
 
 GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions. 
 
 In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007. Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020. Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43 compared to 2005 levels and there is agreement between the EU Member States, the European Parliament, and the EU Commission (which is pending ratification by the EU Council and European Parliament) to increase the Phase IV GHG emissions reduction to 63 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU ETS and, instead, has been under the UK ETS since 2021. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that are subject to the UK ETS. 
 
 From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the Paris Agreement, which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and that withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed the Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America, which allows the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which could lead to additional GHG emission reduction requirements for sources in the United States. 
 
 In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.

 Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. 
 
 An example of one such program is California s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. 
 
 The nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions. 
 
 The GHG reductions required. 
 
 The price and availability of offsets. 
 
 The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances. 
 
 Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. 
 
 Any potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature. 
 
 Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. 
 
 We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. 
 
 In February 2022, we announced our intention to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity related to our operations by 50 of 2019 levels by the year 2050. This new target builds upon our previously announced 2030 GHG emissions intensity targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations by 30 and Scope 3 emissions from our energy products by 15 compared to 2019 levels. 
 
 In addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2022 Sustainability Report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance initiatives, including detailed information on environmental metrics.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates addresses accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. 
 
 Business Combination 
 In accounting for a business combination, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is made in estimating the individual fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, noncontrolling interests and other assets and liabilities. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party specialists in the valuation process as necessary. 
 
 The fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the estimated results used to determine fair value. 
 
 See Note 4 Business Combination, and Note 18 Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings and fair value measurements. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments 
 Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.

 Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.

 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS 

Refining 
 
 Our realized refining margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and (b) costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products. The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call special items. The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as crack spreads. As discussed in Executive Overview and Business Environment Business Environment, industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins. 
 
 The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment s income (loss) before income taxes per barrel. Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool. Following are reconciliations of income (loss) before income taxes to realized refining margins:

 Marketing 
 
 Our realized marketing fuel margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of fuels in our M S segment and (b) costs of those fuels. The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call special items. The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis. We believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries fuel production. 
 
 Within the M S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business income before income taxes per barrel. Realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. Because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items, and because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Financial Instrument Market Risk 
 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, natural gas, renewable feedstock and electric power, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks. 
 
 As a result of the merger, we included the assets and liabilities of DCP Midstream, LLC s Class A Segment (DCP Midstream Class A Segment), DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and cash flows are reported in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from August 18, 2022 through December 31, 2022. 
 
 DCP Midstream Class A Segment s market risks are solely attributable to market risks of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), because DCP LP is the sole operational asset in DCP Midstream Class A Segment. 
 
 DCP LP is exposed to market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. DCP LP uses financial instruments such as forward contracts, swaps and futures to mitigate the effects of these risks. See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the structure of the merger. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices. We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: 
 
 Balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, certain exchange-traded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity. 
 
 Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. 
 
 Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, renewable feedstock and natural gas transactions. 
 
 These objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices. 
 
 Phillips 66 s use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors. This document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations, and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group. 

80 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

 Phillips 66 uses a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 DCP LP s use of derivative instruments is governed by a comprehensive risk management policy and a risk management committee that monitors and manages market risks associated with commodity prices. The risk management committee is composed of DCP LP s senior executives who receive regular briefings on positions and exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management in the context of market activities. The risk management committee is responsible for the overall management of commodity price and credit risks, including monitoring exposure limits. The estimated loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued is not expected to be material to our cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.

 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations. Generally, we do not hedge our foreign currency risk. 
 
 Phillips 66 s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer monitor risks effecting its operations resulting from commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, DCP LP s risk management committee monitors risks effecting its operations resulting from commodity prices and interest rates.

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can normally identify our forward-looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, budget, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will, would, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes, but the absence of such words does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. 
 We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our operations, our joint ventures and entities in which we have equity interests, as well as the industries in which we and they operate. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as they are not guarantees of future performance and involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in any forward-looking statements. Such differences could result from a variety of factors, including: 
 Fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, refined petroleum product and natural gas prices and refining, marketing and petrochemical margins. 
 Changes in governmental policies relating to NGL, crude oil, natural gas or refined petroleum products pricing, regulation or taxation, including exports. 
 Capacity constraints in, or other limitations on, the pipelines, storage and fractionation facilities to which we deliver natural gas or NGL and the availability of alternative markets and arrangements for our natural gas and NGL. 
 Actions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries impacting supply and demand and correspondingly, commodity prices. 
 The ability to achieve the expected benefits of the integration of DCP LP and any other benefits that may result from the buy-in of DCP s publicly-held common units, if consummated. 
 Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities or transporting our products. 
 Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemical products. 
 Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. 
 The level and success of drilling and quality of production volumes around our midstream assets. 
 The inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for capital projects. 
 The inability to comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. 
 Changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect programs like the renewable fuel standards program, low carbon fuel standards and tax credits for biofuels. 
 General domestic and international economic and political developments including armed hostilities, including the Russia-Ukraine war, expropriation of assets, and other political, economic or diplomatic developments, including those caused by public health issues, outbreaks of diseases and pandemics. 
 The impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products from any widespread public health crisis, as well as the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products following any such crisis. 
 83 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

 Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and future capital projects on time and within budget. 
 Potential disruption or interruption of our operations or damage to our facilities due to accidents, weather and climate events, civil unrest, insurrections, political events, terrorism or cyberattacks. 
 The inability to meet our sustainability goals, including reducing our GHG emissions intensity, developing and protecting new technologies, and commercializing lower-carbon opportunities. 
 Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. 
 International monetary conditions and exchange controls. 
 Substantial investments required, or reduced demand for products, as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations, including GHG emissions reductions and reduced consumer demand for refined petroleum products. 
 Liability resulting from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations. 
 Changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations (including alternative energy mandates) applicable to our business. 
 Political and societal concerns about climate change that could result in changes to our business or operations or increase expenditures, including litigation-related expenses. 
 Changes in estimates or projections used to assess fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment and/or strategic decisions or other developments with respect to our asset portfolio that cause impairment charges. 
 Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to changes to our credit profile or illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. 
 The creditworthiness of our customers and the counterparties to our transactions, including the impact of bankruptcies. 
 The operation, financing and distribution decisions of our joint ventures that we do not control. 
 The factors generally described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.

Report of Management 
 
 Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company s financial statements have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Management has made available to Ernst Young LLP all of the company s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders and directors meetings. 
 
 Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Phillips 66 s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 On August 17, 2022, the company and a co-venturer completed the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings, LLC. As a result of the merger and the governance rights delegated to the company over DCP Midstream, LLC s Class A Segment, the company began consolidating the financial results of DCP Midstream, LLC s Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. The company has accounted for the consolidation of these entities as a business combination. Accordingly, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of these entities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the results of operations and cash flows of these entities are reported in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from August 18, 2022 through December 31, 2022. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission for acquisitions completed during the reporting year, we have elected to exclude these entities from the company s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Phillips 66 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Phillips 66 (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 2022, the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We did not audit the 2022 financial statements of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), a consolidated subsidiary, which reflect total assets constituting approximately 18 at December 31, 2022, and total revenues constituting approximately 3 for the year then ended. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for DCP LP for 2022, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Consolidation of DCP Midstream 
 Description of the Matter 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company and its co-venturer merged DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Gray Oak Holdings) on August 17, 2022, with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity. 
 
 The Company determined that each of the two classes of membership interests (the Class A and B Segments) of DCP Midstream should be evaluated for consolidation separately under the variable interest consolidation model. The Company determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Class A Segment due to the governance rights it has as the managing member of that segment, and the initial consolidation was accounted for as a business combination. The Class B Segment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
 
 Evaluating the Company s determination that the Class A and B Segments should be evaluated for consolidation separately was complex and required us to use significant judgment when assessing the effect of the contractual rights and obligations of the Company and its co-venturer in DCP Midstream and the Class A and B Segments on such determination. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over its application of the variable interest consolidation model to DCP Midstream. 
 
 To test the Company s application of the variable interest consolidation model, our audit procedures included identifying the relevant contractual rights and obligations of the Company and its co-venturer in DCP Midstream and the Class A and B Segments, making inquiries of management and legal counsel as to the interpretation and operation of such terms, and evaluating their effect on the Company s consolidation conclusions. In particular, significant judgment was required in evaluating the Company s determination that essentially all of the assets, liabilities and equity of the Class A and B Segments are separate from the overall DCP Midstream entity, and that the two segments should be separately evaluated for consolidation. We also have evaluated the Company s disclosures in relation to this matter.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Phillips 66 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Phillips 66 s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Phillips 66 (the Company), maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of DCP Midstream, LLC s Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC, which are included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 22 of total assets as of December 31, 2022 and approximately 3 of total revenues and other income, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of DCP Midstream, LLC s Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 89

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors of DCP Midstream GP, LLC and the Unitholders of DCP Midstream, LP 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DCP Midstream, LP and subsidiaries (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We did not audit the financial statements of Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, LLC, the Partnership s investment which is accounted for by use of the equity method.

 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net - Determination of Impairment Indicators Refer to Notes 2, 10 and 13 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Partnership periodically evaluates whether the carrying value of long-lived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Management considers various factors when determining if long-lived assets should be evaluated for impairment including a significant adverse change in the business climate, a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a current expectation that the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life. 
 
 The Partnership s determination of whether impairment indicators exist for long-lived assets requires management to apply significant judgment. When events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the applicable asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset recoverability analysis ). If management determines the carrying value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. The property, plant and equipment, net balance was 7,763 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 We identified the identification of impairment indicators for property, plant and equipment and the associated recoverability analysis as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable as well as the significant judgements and assumptions made in the undiscounted cash flow analysis used to evaluate recoverability. 
 
 This required a high degree of auditor judgment, including an increased extent of effort related to evaluating indicators of impairment and auditing whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators and assessed recoverability. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the identification of impairment indicators and recoverability analysis for long-lived assets included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting related to management s identification of possible impairment indicators for long-lived assets that may indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over estimates of future volumes of raw natural gas, or other applicable throughput. 

92 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

 We evaluated management s analysis of impairment indicators by: 
 
 Assessing whether long-lived assets having indicators of impairment were appropriately identified 
 
 Considering industry and analysts reports and the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as adverse changes in the regulatory environment, legislation or other factors that may represent impairment indicators not previously contemplated in management's analysis 
 
 Evaluating management s judgments around historical trends, macroeconomic and industry conditions, and whether projections are consistent with the Partnership s operating strategy 
 
 Evaluating management s forecasts by comparing such forecasts to: information included in the Partnership's public disclosures, recent results of operations, trends in operational data for asset groups such as measures of profitability over recent years and quarters 
 
 Inquiry of management over whether long-lived assets may be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of the assets' previously estimated useful life 
 
 Inspecting minutes of the board of directors and committees of executive management to understand if there were factors that would represent potential impairment indicators for long-lived assets 
 
 For asset groups for which a recoverability analysis was performed, we evaluated management s estimates of future volumes by: 
 
 Comparing recent actual results to management s historical forecasts 
 
 Evaluating the reasonableness of volumetric assumptions by comparing forecasts to permits and rig count data 
 
 Researching industry trends 
 
 Performing a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the change in undiscounted cash flows that would result from changes in underlying volumetric assumptions 
 
 Comparing historical results to management s future assumptions

We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, irrespective of whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, and have elected to recognize forfeitures of awards when they occur.

 interest and jointly governed DCP Midstream, whose primary assets are its general partner and limited partner interests in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), and we each held indirect economic interests in DCP LP of . DCP LP is a VIE because its limited partners do not have the ability to remove its general partner with a simple majority vote, nor do its limited partners have substantive participating rights in the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of business. DCP Midstream ultimately consolidates DCP LP because one of its wholly owned subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary of DCP LP. 
 
 We and Enbridge also held and interests, respectively, in Gray Oak Holdings, whose primary asset was a noncontrolling interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC (Gray Oak Pipeline). Our and Enbridge s indirect economic interests in Gray Oak Pipeline were and , respectively. We had voting control over and consolidated Gray Oak Holdings and reported Gray Oak Holdings interest in Gray Oak Pipeline as an equity investment and Enbridge s interest in Gray Oak Holdings as a noncontrolling interest. 
 
 In connection with the merger, we and Enbridge entered into a Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of DCP Midstream (Amended and Restated LLC Agreement), which realigned the members economic interests and governance responsibilities. Under the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, classes of membership interests in DCP Midstream were created, Class A and Class B, that are intended to track the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the following operating segments of DCP Midstream: 
 
 Class A Segment comprised of the businesses, activities, assets and liabilities of DCP LP and its subsidiaries and its general partner entities (DCP Midstream Class A Segment). 
 Class B Segment comprised of the business, activities, assets and liabilities of Gray Oak Pipeline (DCP Midstream Class B Segment). 
 
 We hold a Class A membership interest, which represents an indirect economic interest in DCP LP of , and a Class B membership interest, which represents an indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline of . Enbridge holds the remaining Class A and Class B membership interests. We have been designated as the managing member of DCP Midstream Class A Segment and are responsible for conducting, directing and managing all activities associated with this segment, except as limited in certain instances. Enbridge has been designated as the managing member of DCP Midstream Class B Segment. Earnings and distributions from each segment are allocated to the members based on their membership interest in each membership class, except as otherwise provided. 
 
 DCP Midstream Class A Segment and DCP Midstream Class B Segment were determined to be silos under the variable interest consolidation model. As a result, DCP Midstream was also determined to be a VIE. We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of DCP Midstream Class A Segment because of the governance rights granted to us under the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement as managing member of the segment. 
 
 We hold a direct ownership interest in DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills). DCP LP holds the remaining ownership interest in these entities. As a result of the governance rights granted to us over DCP Midstream Class A Segment and the governance rights we hold through our direct ownership interests, we obtained controlling financial interests in these entities in connection with the merger. As a result, our aggregate direct and indirect economic interests in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills increased to from . 
 
 Starting on August 18, 2022, we began consolidating the financial results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. We also began reporting the direct and indirect economic interests held by Enbridge, DCP LP s public common unitholders and DCP LP s preferred unitholders as noncontrolling interests on our financial statements.

 indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline and contributed million of cash to DCP Midstream, which was then paid to Enbridge, in return for a incremental indirect economic ownership interest in DCP LP. As noted above, the additional governance rights we were granted as part of this transaction resulted in us consolidating the Class A Segment of DCP Midstream, as well as DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. Given the nature of this transaction, we have accounted for the consolidation of these entities using the acquisition method of accounting. See Note 3 DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, for additional information on the merger and our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. 
 
 Fair value of transferred equity interest Fair value of previously held equity interests Total merger consideration 

The aggregate purchase consideration noted above was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the entities consolidated based upon a preliminary estimate of their fair values as of the August 17, 2022, merger date. Due to the level of effort required to develop fair value measurements, the valuation information necessary to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is preliminary, including the underlying cash flows, appraisals and other information used to estimate the fair values of the net assets acquired and noncontrolling interests in those net assets. We continue to evaluate the factors used in establishing the fair values of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, including, but not limited to, those factors that could affect the estimated fair values of PP E, investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, identifiable intangible assets, leases, financial instruments, asset retirement and environmental obligations, legal contingencies, debt and noncontrolling interests. We will complete a final determination of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the one-year measurement period from the date of the merger. Any adjustments made in subsequent periods could be material to the preliminary values. Adjustments made in the fourth quarter of 2022 were immaterial.

In connection with the merger, we recognized gains totaling million from remeasuring our previously held equity investments to their fair values and a gain of million related to the transfer of a indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer. These gains are included in the Other income line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are reported in the Midstream segment.

Equity Investments 
 Significant affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method, including nonconsolidated VIEs, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, included: 
 
 Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) percent-owned joint venture that manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. We have multiple long-term supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined petroleum products, solvents, fuel gas, natural gas, NGL, and other petrochemical feedstocks. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the book value of our investment in CPChem was million and million, respectively. 
 
 WRB Refining LP (WRB) percent-owned joint venture that owns the Wood River and Borger refineries located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively, for which we are the operator and managing partner. We have a basis difference for our investment in WRB because the carrying value of our investment is lower than our share of WRB s recorded net assets. This basis difference was primarily the result of our contribution of these refineries to WRB. On the contribution closing date, a basis difference was created because the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeded our historical book value. The contribution-related basis difference is primarily being amortized and recognized as a benefit to equity earnings over a period of years, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries PP E at the contribution closing date. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was million. Equity earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were increased by million, million and million, respectively, due to the amortization of our aggregate basis difference. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the book value of our investment in WRB was million and million, respectively. 
 
 Gulf Coast Express LLC (Gulf Coast Express) DCP LP percent-owned joint venture that owns an intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Waha area in West Texas to Agua Dulce, in Nueces County, Texas. The pipeline is operated by a co-venturer. This investment was acquired as part of our consolidation of the DCP Midstream Class A Segment starting on August 18, 2022, and was initially recorded at its estimated fair value on this date. The estimated fair value of this investment exceeds our share of Gulf Coast Express recorded net assets, which results in a basis difference. At December 31, 2022, the preliminary aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was million. The estimated fair value of the investment in Gulf Coast Express, the allocation of the basis difference to Gulf Coast Express net assets and the basis difference amortization period are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to change until we finalize our acquisition accounting for the DCP Midstream Class A Segment. At December 31, 2022, the book value, including the preliminary fair value adjustment, of the investment in Gulf Coast Express was million.

 percent-owned joint ventures. Dakota Access owns a pipeline system that transports crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and ETCO owns a connecting crude oil pipeline system that extends from Patoka to Nederland, Texas. These pipeline systems collectively form the Bakken Pipeline system, which is operated by a co-venturer. 
 
 In 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The court later vacated the easement. Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021. In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed. 
 
 In February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Court) denied Dakota Access writ of certiorari requesting the Court to review the lower court s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement. Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stands. Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing. The draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and release is expected in Spring 2023. 
 
 Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access in March 2019. On April 1, 2022, Dakota Access wholly owned subsidiary repaid million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity. We funded our share, or million, with a capital contribution of million in March 2022 and million of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access senior unsecured notes was billion. 
 
 In conjunction with the notes offering, Phillips 66 Partners, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU). Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation. At December 31, 2022, our share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately million. 
 
 If the pipeline is required to cease operations, and should Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay ongoing expenses, we could be required to support our share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate book value of our investments in Dakota Access and ETCO was million and million, respectively. 
 
 Front Range Pipeline LLC (Front Range) DCP LP percent-owned joint venture that owns an NGL pipeline that originates in the DJ Basin and extends to Skellytown, Texas. The pipeline is operated by a co-venturer. This investment was acquired as part of our consolidation of the DCP Midstream Class A Segment starting on August 18, 2022, and was initially recorded at its estimated fair value on this date. The estimated fair value of this investment exceeds our share of Front Range s recorded net assets, which results in a basis difference. At December 31, 2022, the preliminary aggregate remaining basis difference for this investment was million. The estimated fair value of the investment in Front Range, the allocation of the basis difference to Front Range s net assets and the basis difference amortization period are based on preliminary estimates and are subject to change until we finalize our acquisition accounting for the DCP Midstream Class A Segment. At December 31, 2022, the book value, including the fair value adjustment, of the investment in Front Range was million.

 percent-owned joint venture that owns a natural gas pipeline system that extends from Wyoming and Colorado to Ohio with a bidirectional section that extends from Ohio to Illinois. The REX Pipeline system is operated by our co-venturer. We have a basis difference for our investment in REX because the carrying value of our investment is lower than our share of REX s recorded net assets. This basis difference was created by historical impairment charges we recorded for this investment and is being amortized and recognized as a benefit to equity earnings over a period of years, which was the estimated remaining useful life of REX s PP E when the impairment charges were recorded. At December 31, 2022, the remaining basis difference for this investment was million. Equity earnings for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were increased by million due to the amortization of our basis difference.

 CF United LLC (CF United) A retail marketing joint venture with operations primarily on the U.S. West Coast. We own a voting interest and a economic interest in this joint venture. CF United is considered a VIE, because our co-venturer has an option to require us to purchase its interest based on a fixed multiple. The put option becomes effective July 1, 2023, and expires on March 31, 2024. The put option is viewed as a variable interest as the purchase price on the exercise date may not represent the then-current fair value of CF United. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary because we and our co-venturer jointly direct the activities of CF United that most significantly impact economic performance. At December 31, 2022, our maximum exposure to loss was comprised of our million investment in CF United, and any potential future loss resulting from the put option should the purchase price based on a fixed multiple exceed the then-current fair value of CF United. At December 31, 2021, the book value of our investment in CF United was million. 
 
 OnCue Holdings, LLC (OnCue) percent-owned joint venture that owns and operates retail convenience stores. We fully guaranteed various debt agreements of OnCue, and our co-venturer did not participate in the guarantees. This entity is considered a VIE because our debt guarantees resulted in OnCue not being exposed to all potential losses. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance. At December 31, 2022, our maximum exposure to loss was million, which represented the book value of our investment in OnCue of million and guaranteed debt obligations of million. At December 31, 2021, the book value of our investment in OnCue was million.

 On June 23, 2022, we entered into a new billion revolving credit facility (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of June 22, 2027. The Facility replaced our previous billion revolving credit facility with Phillips 66 as the borrower and Phillips 66 Company as the guarantor. The Facility contains usual and customary covenants that are similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We have the option to increase the overall capacity to billion, subject to certain conditions. We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to additional terms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either (a) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin. The Facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, amount had been drawn under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Phillips 66 also has a billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility. Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to days. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, borrowings were outstanding under the program. 
 
 Phillips 66 Partners 
 
 In connection with entering into the Facility, we terminated Phillips 66 Partners million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2021, there were borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility and million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by its revolving credit facility. 
 
 DCP Midstream Class A Segment 
 
 DCP LP has a credit facility under its amended credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a borrowing capacity of up to billion that matures on March 18, 2027. The Credit Agreement grants DCP LP the option to increase the revolving loan commitment by an aggregate principal amount of up to million and to extend the term for up to additional periods, subject to requisite lender approval. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid based on DCP LP s credit rating. At December 31, 2022, DCP LP had borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, million in letters of credit had been issued that are supported by the Credit Agreement. 
 
 DCP LP has an accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) that provides for up to million of borrowing capacity through August 2024 at an adjusted SOFR and includes an uncommitted option to increase the total commitments under the Securitization Facility by up to an additional million. Under the Securitization Facility, certain of DCP LP s wholly owned subsidiaries sell or contribute receivables to another of DCP LP s consolidated subsidiaries, DCP Receivables LLC (DCP Receivables), a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility. At December 31, 2022, million of borrowings were outstanding under the Securitization Facility, which are secured by accounts receivable at DCP Receivables.

 Guarantees of Joint Venture Obligations 
 In March 2019, Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers in Dakota Access provided a CECU in conjunction with a senior unsecured notes offering. See Note 8 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information on Dakota Access and the CECU. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we also had other guarantees outstanding primarily for our portion of certain joint venture debt, which have remaining terms of up to . The maximum potential future exposures under these guarantees were approximately million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its obligations. 
 
 Indemnifications 
 Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, litigation, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, and real estate tenant defaults. The provisions of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, which generally have indefinite terms and potentially unlimited exposure. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of recorded indemnifications was million and million, respectively. 
 
 We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information to support the reversal. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, environmental accruals for known contamination of million and million, respectively, were included in the carrying amount of the recorded indemnifications noted above. These environmental accruals were primarily included in the Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs line item on our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs and Note 16 Contingencies and Commitments. 
 
 Indemnification and Release Agreement 
 In 2012, in connection with our separation from ConocoPhillips, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement. This agreement governs the treatment between ConocoPhillips and us of matters relating to indemnification, insurance, litigation responsibility and management, and litigation document sharing and cooperation arising in connection with the separation. Generally, the agreement provides for cross indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of ConocoPhillips business with ConocoPhillips. The agreement also establishes procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters.

 Note 16 

Environmental 
 We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management s best estimates, using information available at the time. We measure estimates and base contingent liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring contingent environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies cleanup experience, and data released by the EPA or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable. 
 
 Although liability for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies alleged to have liability at a particular site. Due to such joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, although some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar and time limits. 
 
 We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those pertaining to sites acquired in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

 Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements 
 We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of third-party financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of our business. At December 31, 2022, the estimated aggregate future payments under these agreements were million per year for each year from 2023 through 2027 and million in aggregate for all years after 2027. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total payments under these agreements were million, million and million, respectively.

 . We continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties and recognize bad debt expense based on a probability assessment of credit loss. Generally, we do not require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments or master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us to others to be offset against amounts owed to us. 
 
 The credit risk from our derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements, typically on a daily basis, until settled. 
 
 Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit ratings. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if our credit ratings fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many contracts also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral. 
 
 The aggregate fair values of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position were immaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 crude oil transportation and terminaling joint ventures were calculated by weighting the results of different economic scenarios using the income approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model that requires various observable and nonobservable inputs, including volumes, rates/tariffs, expenses and discount rates. These valuations resulted in a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 
 
 DCP Midstream 
 In the first quarter of 2020, the nonrecurring fair value measurement used to record an impairment of our DCP Midstream investment was the fair value of our share of DCP Midstream s limited partner interest in DCP LP, which was estimated based on average market prices of DCP LP s common units for a multi-day trading period encompassing March 31, 2020. This valuation resulted in a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 
 
 PP E and Intangible Assets 
 
 Alliance Refinery 
 In the third quarter of 2021, we remeasured the carrying value of the net PP E of our Alliance Refinery asset group to fair value. The fair value of PP E was determined using a combination of the income, cost and sales comparison approaches. The income approach used a discounted cash flow model that requires various observable and non-observable inputs, such as commodity prices, margins, operating rates, sales volumes, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The cost approach used assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar plant and equipment assets adjusted for estimated physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. The sales comparison approach used the value of similar properties recently sold or currently offered for sale. This valuation resulted in a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 
 
 San Francisco Refinery 
 In the third quarter of 2020, we remeasured the carrying value of the net PP E and intangible assets of our San Francisco Refinery asset group to fair value. The estimated fair value of the plants, equipment and intangible assets was determined using a replacement cost approach adjusted, as applicable, for physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. The estimated fair value of the properties was determined using a sales comparison approach. This valuation resulted in a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. 
 
 Goodwill 
 The carrying value of the Refining reporting unit s goodwill was remeasured to fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the first quarter of 2020. The fair value of the Refining reporting unit was calculated by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach. The income approach used a discounted cash flow model that included various observable and nonobservable inputs, such as prices, volumes, expenses, capital expenditures, discount rates and projected long-term growth rates and terminal values. The market approach used peer company enterprise values relative to current and future net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) projections to arrive at an average multiple. This multiple was applied to the reporting unit s current and projected EBITDA, with consideration for an estimated market participant acquisition premium. The resulting Level 3 fair value estimate was less than the Refining reporting unit s carrying value by an amount that exceeded the existing goodwill balance of the reporting unit. As a result, the Refining reporting unit s goodwill was impaired to . As part of our impairment analysis, the fair value of all reporting units was reconciled to the company s market capitalization.

 million. The preliminary fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach. The income approach used discounted cash flow models that require various observable and non-observable inputs, such as margins, tariffs and rates, utilization, volumes, product costs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and risk-adjusted discount rates. These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements. 
 
 PP E 
 The preliminary fair value of PP E was million. The preliminary fair value of these assets was determined primarily using the cost approach. The cost approach used assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar plant and equipment assets adjusted for estimated physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. The estimated fair value of properties was determined using a sales comparison approach. These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements. 
 
 Debt 
 The preliminary fair value of DCP LP s senior and junior subordinated notes was measured using a market approach, based on the average of quotes for the acquired debt from major financial institutions. These valuations resulted in Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurements. 
 
 Gain Related to Merger of Businesses 
 In connection with the merger, we recognized before-tax gains totaling million from remeasuring our previously held equity investments to their fair values and a before-tax gain of million related to the transfer of a indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer. The preliminary fair values of our previously held equity interest in DCP Midstream and the equity interest in Gray Oak Pipeline we transferred were primarily based on DCP LP s publicly traded common unit market price on the effective date of the merger, August 17, 2022, the cash consideration contributed and obligations that were deemed to be effectively settled. This valuation resulted in Level 1 nonrecurring fair value measurements. The preliminary fair values of our previously held equity interests in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were determined using the income approach. The income approach used discounted cash flow models that require various observable and non-observable inputs, such as tariffs, volumes, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal-year values and risk-adjusted discount rates. These valuations resulted in Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interests 
 As a result of our consolidation of the DCP Midstream Class A Segment, the noncontrolling interests held in the DCP Midstream Class A Segment were recorded at their estimated fair values on the merger date. These noncontrolling interests primarily include Enbridge s indirect economic interest in DCP LP, the public holders of DCP LP s common units and the holders of DCP LP s preferred units. The fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP s common units was based on their unit market price as of the date of the merger, August 17, 2022. The fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP s publicly traded preferred units was based on their respective market price as of the date of the merger, August 17, 2022. These valuations resulted in Level 1 nonrecurring fair value measurements. The preliminary fair value of the noncontrolling interests in DCP LP s other preferred units was based on an income approach that used projected distributions that were discounted using an average implied yield of DCP LP s publicly traded preferred units and expected redemption dates. This valuation resulted in a Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurement.

 In March 2020, we announced that we had temporarily suspended our share repurchases to preserve liquidity in response to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We resumed purchasing shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2022. On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a billion increase to our share repurchase program. Since July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to these authorizations and may commence, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time. In 2022, we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, we have repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.

For both U.S. and international pension plans, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, actuarial gains resulted in decreases in our U.S. and international pension benefit obligations of million and million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, actuarial gains resulted in decreases in our U.S. and international pension benefit obligations of million and million, respectively. The primary driver for the actuarial gains in 2022 and 2021 was increases in the discount rates. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the weighted-average actual return on plan assets was negative , which resulted in a decrease in our U.S. and international plan assets of million and million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the weighted-average actual return on plan assets was , which resulted in an increase in our U.S. and international plan assets of million and million, respectively. The primary driver of the return on plan assets in 2022 and 2021 was fluctuations in the equity and fixed income markets. 
 
 Our other postretirement benefit plans for health insurance are contributory. Effective December 31, 2012, we terminated the subsidy for retiree medical plans. Since January 1, 2013, eligible employees have been able to utilize notional amounts credited to an account during their period of service with the company to pay all, or a portion, of their cost to participate in postretirement health insurance. In general, employees hired after December 31, 2012, will not receive credits to an account, but will have unsubsidized access to health insurance through the plan. The cost of health insurance will be adjusted annually by the company s actuary to reflect actual experience and expected health care cost trends. The measurement of the accumulated benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of in 2023 that declines to by 2029.

 equity securities, debt securities, real estate investments and in all other types of investments as of December 31, 2022. Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded, therefore minimizing the liquidity risk in the portfolio. 
 
 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. 
 
 Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities are based on quoted market prices. 
 
 Fair values of corporate debt securities are estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. 
 
 Fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their carrying amounts. 
 
 Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans participants. 
 
 Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts and real estate and infrastructure investments are valued at the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient. The NAV is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund and the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets. These investments valued at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy, but are presented in the fair value table to permit reconciliation of total plan assets to the amounts presented in the fair value table.

Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to international plans are subject to local laws and tax regulations. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan asset returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, and other economic factors. In 2023, we expect to contribute approximately million to our U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans and million to our international pension plans.

 million shares of Phillips 66 s common stock remained available to be issued to settle share-based awards under the 2022 P66 Omnibus Plan. 
 
 We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of: (1) the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or (2) the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than as this is the minimum period of time required for an award not to be subject to forfeiture. Our equity-classified programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time they become eligible for retirement (at age with years of service). We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, irrespective of whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, and have elected to recognize forfeitures of awards when they occur.

 . The grant date fair value is equal to the average of the high and low market price of our stock on the grant date. The recipients receive a quarterly dividend equivalent cash payment until the RSU is settled by issuing share of our common stock for each RSU at the end of the service period. RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees are not subject to forfeiture after the grant date. Special RSUs are granted to attract or retain key personnel and the terms and conditions may vary by award.

At December 31, 2022, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested RSU awards was million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of months, the longest period being months. 
 
 During 2021 and 2020, we granted RSUs with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of and , respectively. During 2021 and 2020, we issued shares with an aggregate fair value of million and million, respectively, to settle RSUs. 
 
 Performance Share Units 
 Under the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan, senior management is annually awarded restricted performance share units (PSUs) with performance periods. These awards vest when the HRCC approves the performance results, which represents the grant date. PSUs granted under Phillips 66 s incentive plans are classified as liability awards and compensation expense is recognized beginning on the authorization date and ending on the vesting date. 
 
 PSUs granted under the applicable Phillips 66 incentive plan are settled by cash payments equal to the fair value of the awards, which is based on the market prices of our stock near the end of the performance periods. The HRCC must approve the performance results prior to payout. Dividend equivalents are not paid on these awards. 
 
 PSUs granted under prior incentive compensation plans were classified as equity awards. These equity awards are settled upon an employee s retirement by issuing share of our common stock for each PSU held. Dividend equivalents are paid on these awards.

 Dividend yield Volatility factor Expected life (years) 

We calculate the volatility factor using historical Phillips 66 end-of-week closing stock prices. We periodically calculate the average period of time elapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants. 
 
 Other 
 Other share-based compensation expense is primarily associated with the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment following the August 18, 2022, merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. Under DCP Midstream Class A Segment s Long-Term Incentive Plan, phantom units, performance units and distribution equivalent rights are rewarded to key employees.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, we recorded a tax benefit reflecting the carryback of a significant portion of our 2020 net operating loss to a year that had a 35 federal statutory income tax rate. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) that includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15 minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income as defined in the IRA, which is effective after December 31, 2022. We are continuing to evaluate the IRA and its requirements, as well as the application to our business.

At December 31, 2022, the loss and credit carryforward deferred tax assets were primarily related to a foreign tax credit carryforward in the United States of million; a state tax net operating loss carryforward of million; and a capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards in the United Kingdom of million. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2040. Foreign tax credit carryforwards, which have a full valuation allowance against them, begin to expire in 2029. The other loss and credit carryforwards, all of which relate to foreign operations, and have a full valuation allowance against them, have indefinite lives. 
 
 Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our total valuation allowance balance increased by million. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future and available tax planning strategies, management expects the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and the tax consequences of future taxable income. 
 
 Earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint ventures after December 31, 2017, are generally not subject to incremental income taxes in the United States or withholding taxes in foreign countries upon repatriation. As such, we only assert that the earnings of one of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of this foreign subsidiary was not material.

With respect to various unrecognized income tax benefits and the related accrued liabilities, we do not expect any to be recognized or paid within the next twelve months. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties, net of accrued income taxes, totaled million, million and million, respectively. These accruals decreased our results by million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 Audits in significant jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2020), Germany (2017) and United States (2013). Certain issues remain in dispute for audited years, and unrecognized income tax benefits for years still subject to or currently undergoing an audit are subject to change. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized income tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Although it is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized income tax benefits, the amount of change is not estimable.

 of Gray Oak Pipeline. In December 2018, a third party acquired a interest in the holding company. Because the holding company s sole asset was its ownership interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, which was considered a financial asset, and because certain restrictions were placed on the third party s ability to transfer or sell its interest in the holding company during construction of the pipeline, the legal sale of the interest did not qualify as a sale under GAAP at that time. The pipeline commenced full operations in the second quarter of 2020, and the restrictions placed on the co-venturer were lifted on June 30, 2020, resulting in the recognition of the sale under GAAP. Accordingly, at June 30, 2020, the co-venturer s interest in the holding company was recharacterized from a long-term obligation to a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet, and the premium of million previously paid by the co-venturer in 2019 was recharacterized from a long-term obligation to a gain in our consolidated statement of operations.
