PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

CORPORATE HISTORY 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada
on April 3, 2007 under the name Descanso Agency, Inc. We originally incorporated to enter into the travel industry by establishing a specialized
service travel company that serves the needs of Mexican and United States wedding planners, travel agents, and clients seeking upscale
personal attention at unique hotels and spas located in Mexico. Our core business plan was intended to focus on the wedding and party
destination travel. However, due to a lack of available financing, the Company ceased its current operations in September 2009 relating
to the travel industry and began seeking out viable alternatives. 

On October 16, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Amendment
with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to Pacific Blue Energy Corp. The name change reflected the Company's refocused business
at that time as an independent alternative energy company. We began the process of approaching potential investment partners
and have also began seeking out potential opportunities, including joint venture opportunities. We attempted to finance our operations
through a combination of privately placed debt and/or equity. With the alignment started time of a number of positive factors including
technical advances, tax incentives, rising environmental awareness and the state of the economy, the availability of clean, affordable,
solar and wind powered electricity to power homes and small businesses then become a reality. 

Effective November 6, 2009, the Company implemented
a 4-for-1 forward split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, whereby every share of common stock held was exchanged for
4 shares of common stock. As a result, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock were increased from 9,250,000 prior to the forward
split to 37,000,000 immediately following the forward split. 

On April 5, 2010, the Company acquired a 100 interest
of Ship Ahoy LLC, a limited liability company in Arizona, in exchange for 300,000 and 1,000,000 common shares of the Company. This investment
was subsequently abandoned by the Company. On August 22, 2019, the Company changed its' name to
Cannonau Corp. to reflect its' focus on its new CBD based products. 

OUR BUSINESS 

 The Company using cutting edge nanotechnology
plans to offer the most advanced Cannabidiol (CBD) for improved bioavailability and maximum benefit. We believe that our unique
formulas can be easily incorporated into a wide array of products, offering customers an advantage when it counts. 

EMPLOYEES 

 As of the date of this Annual Report, we have no employees.

on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates made by management. 

Stock Based Compensation 

We account for share-based compensation at fair value.
Stock based compensation cost for stock options granted to employees, board members and service providers is determined at the grant date
using an option pricing model. The value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expensed on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period. During the year ended December 31, 2022 2021, no stock compensation was issued.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders of Cannonau Corp 

 937 Old Seneca Turnpike Road 

 Skaneateles, NY 13252-9318 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Cannonau Corp (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the two years ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered
recurring losses since inception, has a shareholder deficit, and the Company and has not generated sufficient revenues to date to cover
its operating costs these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

A critical audit matter is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the
Company s governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating a critical audit, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We determined that there are no critical audit
matters communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 

and common shares of the Company. This investment was subsequently abandoned by the Company and
therefore no longer reflecting in these financial statements. The Company is currently developing
CBD based products. On August 22, 2019, the Company changed its' name to Cannonau Corp. to reflect its' focus on its new CBD based products. 

Going Concern 

These financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has not generated sufficient revenues to date to cover its operating cost and has never paid any dividends
and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company had minimal revenues and an accumulated deficit of 3,788,168 and a working capital of deficit of 238,336. As of December 31,
2021, the Company had minimal revenues and an accumulated deficit of 3,788,168 and a working capital of deficit of 238,336. The continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity
or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

2. Identify performance obligations 

a. At contract inception, management assesses the product promised in a contract
with a customer and identifies each promise as a performance obligation to transfer to the customer either: a) A product (or a bundle
of products) that is distinct b) A series of distinct products that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer
to the customer 

3. Determined expected transaction price 

a. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer 

4. Allocate to performance obligations 

a. Once the separate performance obligations are identified and the transaction
price has been determined, management allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in proportion to their standalone
selling prices 

5. Recognize revenue upon transfer of control over goods 

a. management recognizes revenue only when it satisfies a performance obligation
by transferring a promised good to a customer. A good or service is considered to be transferred when the customer obtains control. 

b. The standard defines control as an entity s ability to direct the
use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset. 

c. Control is assessed primarily from the customer s perspective. 

Level 3 

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the
assets or liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to
ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values
because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 

Loss contingencies considered remote are
generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe,
based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect
the Company s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2021. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
discussions regarding required disclosure. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal control over financial reporting for our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Internal control over our financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairy reflect our transactions. 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention through collusion of improper overriding of controls.
Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 in Internal-Control-Integrated
Framework and implemented a process to monitor and assess both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls.
Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

 22 

(1) 
 We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management's view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company's financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management's activities 

(2) 
 We did not maintain enough skilled accounting resources supporting the financial close and reporting processes to ensure (i) changes and entry to spreadsheets utilized in the financial reporting process were properly reviewed, (ii) significant estimates and judgments were adequately supported, reviewed, approved and evaluated against actual experiences, (iii) effective and timely analysis and reconciliation of significant accounts, and (iv) a proper review of period close entries and procedures 

We have instituted remediation plan which involves
reeducating our management, the accounting staff, and the administrative staff as to the elements of a completed sale. We increased the
oversight of the process by increasing the frequency of involvement of outside accounting consultants. Internal systems are being put
into place to track and document significant dates, such as delivery, installation and customer acceptance. In addition, the bookkeeping
system has been modified so that all sales of extended warranties are automatically recorded as deferred revenue and that the amount of
revenue that is ultimately recognized as warranty revenue is as the result of an analysis of the significant aspects of the warranty such
as coverage and period. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management has evaluated, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have
assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps beginning in 2023 to remedy such deficiencies.

TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

We do not have a specific policy or procedure for the review, approval,
or ratification of any transaction involving related persons. We historically have sought and obtained funding from officers, directors,
and family members as these categories of persons are familiar with our management and often provide better terms and conditions than
we can obtain from unassociated sources. Also, we are so small that having specific policies or procedures of this type would be unworkable.

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES. 

The following table shows the fees paid or accrued for the audit and other
services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.

Audit Fees 

Audit fees represent the professional services rendered for the audit of
our annual financial statements and the review of our financial statements included in quarterly reports, along with services normally
provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 

Audit Related Fees 

Audit-related fees represent professional services rendered for assurance
and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial
statements that are not reported under audit fees. 

Tax Fees 

Tax fees represent professional services rendered by the principal accountant
for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. 

All Other Fees 

All other fees represent fees billed for products and services provided
by the principal accountant, other than the services reported for the other categories. 

PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES 

Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent
auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors before the respective services were
rendered. Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the
provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors independence.
