 Item 1. Business 
 
 Overview 
 
 Shift Technologies, Inc. ("Shift", the "Company") is a consumer-centric omnichannel retailer transforming the used car industry by leveraging its end-to-end ecommerce platform and retail locations to provide a technology-driven, hassle-free customer experience. 
 
 Formed in 2013 and launched in 2014, Shift started as a pure ecommerce seller and buyer of used cars, aimed at transforming the customer experience within the industry. Since inception, Shift has invested significantly in its technology platform in an effort to create an exceptional customer experience and to support and leverage the internal operations of the Company. 
 
 In August 2022, Shift announced both a strategic and operational restructuring and a merger with CarLotz, Inc. ("CarLotz"), a consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace that operated a technology-enabled buying, sourcing, and selling model with an omnichannel experience. With the implementation of the restructuring in the second half of 2022 and the close of the merger on December 9, 2022, Shift evolved into an omnichannel used vehicle retailer and established a plan to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing operating expenses and maximizing liquidity. 
 
 The Company has three markets in California and Oregon, where customers can test drive vehicles and work with sales associates during any point of the sale process. Each market has Shift-managed reconditioning centers to prepare each vehicle for sale using a 150+ point inspection process. In-house reconditioning provides better control of timing and greater efficiency within our operations. In addition to performing the 150+ point inspection, we offer customers a seven-day, 200-mile return policy, to ensure consumer confidence in their purchase from Shift. 
 
 Following the merger with CarLotz, Shift has adopted an omnichannel distribution strategy. A car purchase can be complicated and is typically one of the largest purchases in an individual s life. Because diverse buyers and sellers like to transact differently, the omnichannel business model allows Shift to meet our customers where they would like to be served. For those who embrace a fully online experience, Shift has a highly rated end-to-end ecommerce platform. For those who would like personal help, Shift has three markets with trained sales consultants who will walk a customer through the entire research and sales process. 
 
 Shift's approach has always been driven by technology. Our technology enables a superior customer experience and is critical to our scalability in many areas of our operations. 
 
 The Shift technology platform provides a seamless consumer experience for buying a car - from the search and discover experience on the website to a seamless digitally-driven purchase transaction including financing and vehicle protection products. 
 
 The Shift technology platform provides a comprehensive experience for those selling cars as well. Customers go online, enter information about their car, and get an instant online quote. The machine learning-driven acquisition engine predicts the price we will pay for the vehicle, the price at which we can resell the vehicle, the level of reconditioning required to determine impact on margin and operations, and the likelihood that consumers will purchase ancillary products in connection with the sale of the vehicle. 
 
 We use proprietary technology in many areas of our operations including inventory acquisition, pricing, and reconditioning processes to improve efficiency and allow us to scale operations. For example, mechanics use an app that displays a step-by-step guide for inspection and reconditioning, while tracking this data in a cloud database for real-time analytics and decision engine processing to provide optimized reconditioning standards.

Industry and Market Opportunity 
 
 The U.S. used automotive market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption. 
 
 Massive market : According to Cox Automotive, the U.S. used vehicle market hit an all-time record of 40.9 million units in 2021. At an average selling price in 2021 of approximately 26,700 per Statista, the industry generated over 1 trillion in sales. 
 
 Highly fragmented : Market share in the US is extremely fragmented with the top 100 used vehicle retailers accounting for only approximately 11.1 of total used car sales in the US, according to Automotive News. 
 
 Ripe for disruption : The used car buying process suffers from poor overall consumer experience, which is attributable to opaque pricing, high pressure sales tactics, inventory of questionable and widely varying quality, and a generally arduous and lengthy sales process. The peer-to-peer market has even greater challenges for consumers including lack of transparency, the possibility of fraud, logistical challenges, limited or no ability to test drive or return vehicles, lack of financing or warranty options. 
 
 Limited ecommerce penetration : The used automotive market remains among the least penetrated ecommerce markets in the US with consumer interest in online auto purchases increasing. According to Data Feed Watch, 61 of US car buyers are open to purchasing online versus only 32 before COVID-19. 
 
 Consumer desire for omnichannel experience: While Shift was founded as a pure e-commerce used auto buyer and seller and has invested heavily in technology to provide a consumer-centric platform, we believe many consumers would like to choose how they shop. According to Auto Success Online, roughly 90 of consumers now expect retail businesses to offer omni-channel experiences and many in the auto industry believe shopping for a car will become a true omnichannel approach, allowing customers to research and build deals online, but still meet someone at a dealership if desired and convenient.

Table of Contents 

 We are focused on the largest segment of the used car market, which comprises inventory between 3 and 10 years of age a category that makes up approximately 84 of all used vehicle transactions based on a 2019 NIADA report. We believe this makes us well positioned to take market share from legacy auto retailers as its inventory is most heavily concentrated in the deepest pool of demand in the used auto market. In mid-2019, to address a perceived need in the lower price point market, we classified our inventory into two categories, Shift Value and Shift Certified. Shift Value inventory is made up of cars that are over 8 years old or have more than 80,000 miles. Shift Certified inventory consists of vehicles less than 8 years old with less than 80,000 miles. While all vehicles are subjected to the same 150+ point inspection and our high mechanical and safety standards, this segmentation allows us to focus sales and marketing strategies, as well as optimize cosmetic reconditioning costs, for cars with a lower overall purchase price. Consumers seeking Shift Value vehicles are generally less concerned with cosmetic deficiencies; therefore, we have focused our reconditioning on these vehicles to safety and longevity issues, passing on savings to customers while also increasing profitability. This strategy allows us to effectively sell selected older and higher-mileage inventory. In addition, in-house reconditioning provides better control of timing and greater efficiency, especially amongst Shift Value vehicles, and provides the ability to customer standards by distinct categories.

How Shift Delivers on its Mission to Make Car Purchase and Ownership Simple 
 
 Shift s mission is to make car purchase and ownership simple to make buying or selling a used car fun, fair and accessible to everyone. 
 
 Unique Inventory: We source the vast majority of our vehicles from consumers and third-party consumer facing partners who use the Shift platform. We believe our differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers utilizing proprietary software provides Shift with access to a deep pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory. The proprietary software predicts real-time market-based demand and establishes a profitable market clearing price for the vehicles. Shift s strategy offers a wide variety of vehicles across the entire spectrum of model, price, age, and mileage to provide the right car for buyers regardless of interest, need, budget, or credit. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Shift sourced 95 of its inventory from consumer-sellers and partners driving improved margins and nearly eliminating reliance on volatile auction markets to source inventory. 
 
 Omnichannel Experience: We believe customers value convenience and choice in inventory, vehicle products and services, and especially in how they purchase a vehicle. By providing an omnichannel experience, we can deliver the experience the customer chooses and prefers. Our end-to-end ecommerce platform and our three markets in California and Oregon support all experiences. 
 
 Buy online: Customers can buy a car sight-unseen without a test drive and have it delivered to their home quickly with the same seven-day, 200-mile return policy as is offered on cars bought in person. 
 
 In-person at a Shift location: Customers may come to a location to see and test drive multiple cars. Sales consultants on-site can answer questions and walk a customer through the entire search for and purchase of a car. However, if customers would like to search inventory at a location on their own, when they arrive, they can scan a QR code on each car to immediately view all relevant details, including ownership service history, inspection reports, vehicle history reports, and most importantly, dynamic pricing and market price comparisons, giving customers control in this stage of the search process. 
 
 A combination of the online experience and in-person experience at a Shift location. A customer may start a transaction online and, at any point in the process, pick up where they left off at a location and finish in-person. 
 
 Customized Research and Discovery: The vast majority of consumer auto purchases involve online research. Our continued investments in our research and discovery functionality, including our machine learning-enabled recommendation engine, create a platform that draws customers to engage with the Shift website and provide a seamless search experience. 
 
 Value-Added Products to Support Ownership: Like other used car dealerships, Shift offers a full suite of products to finance and protect their vehicle. However, unlike traditional used car dealership where these products and services are sold in a high pressured in-person environment, Shift makes this process hassle-free. Products include vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection and wheel and tire coverage. If a customer chooses an in-person experience at one of our locations, a trained sales consultant can walk each customer through the financing and product options in a low-pressure environment, partnering with the customer to find the best products for their situation. If a customer chooses an online experience, we connect customers to various lending partners for a completely digital end-to-end process for financing and service products. A customer can also complete a short online prequalification form and immediately see a filtered view of cars that meet their budget based on the financing options for which they are likely to be able to qualify. Customers can also get approved for financing before they even test drive a car, making it much more likely that the customer will purchase a car from us.

 Easy Tech-Enabled Selling Experience: Shift s technology makes selling a car just as easy as buying a car. Sellers are able to go to Shift.com, submit information on their car, and get a quote instantly. Shift uses a proprietary algorithm for pricing that utilizes current market information about market conditions, demand and supply, and car option data, among other factors. Using proprietary pricing, Shift provides an immediate quote for a customer s trade-in vehicle, and will schedule a pickup at the customer s location. Shift provides selling customers with information on market rates and, when a customer is ready to sell their car, we can digitally initiate e-contracting and an ACH transfer and conveniently take the car on the seller s behalf so the seller doesn t even have to leave his or her home to sell their car. 
 
 Exceptional Overall Customer Experience: Shift was born from a dissatisfaction with the traditional used car-buying experience, which can feel time-consuming, stressful, and dishonest. Our goal is to turn what is generally regarded as a burdensome necessity into a delightful and convenient experience. We achieve this by offering customers no-haggle pricing and a partner not push buying experience all within our omnichannel sales model. And, unlike many traditional used car dealers, we don t employ pushy salespeople. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The used vehicle market in the United States is highly fragmented, with the top 100 used vehicle retailers accounting for only approximately 11.1 of total used car sales according to Automotive News as well as a large number of transactions occurring in the peer-to-peer market. Competitors in the used vehicle market include: 
 
 traditional new and used car dealerships; 
 the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites such as Facebook, Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay Motors and Nextdoor; 
 used car ecommerce businesses or online platforms, mainly Carvana and Vroom; and 
 sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles which were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales. 
 
 Our primary competitors, traditional brick-and-mortar used auto dealers, are operating under an outdated business model, which relies on a lack of transparency, high pressure sales tactics, limited inventory, and scarce physical locations to which the customer must travel. These drawbacks in the traditional retail model have allowed ecommerce and omnichannel competitors to rapidly gain share of the used car dealer market in recent years. Additionally, we are well-positioned to gain share from the peer-to-peer market given our focus on acquiring inventory from consumers rather than auctions.

 Our Competitive Strengths 
 
 Omnichannel experience: We believe an omnichannel experience broadens our customer base by including all sales channels and increases customer satisfaction by offering convenience and more choices in how they can transact. With these benefits of an omnichannel model, there is opportunity to drive retail unit sales given and increase product attach rate with knowledgeable sales consultants supporting the in-store purchases. 
 
 Purpose-built ecommerce platform : The Shift platform was built to be an end-to-end online auto solution for consumers who yearn for a differentiated, simple and efficient transaction. The streamlined nature of our business allows for scalability and efficiency in costs compared to our competitors in the auto retail industry, and technology creates a better overall experience for the consumer. 
 
 Consumer-centric technology : Our technology enhances the auto shopping experience while making the process fun and easy compared to the poorly rated experience of dealing with a traditional brick-and-mortar dealer. Most customers begin their car search online and spend most of their car-shopping experience online. Therefore, we believe the best way to enhance the overall process is to provide a digitally driven omnichannel approach to not only begin, but seamlessly complete, the car-buying experience online. 
 Exceptional Customer Experience: Customer response to the Shift experience is extremely positive, resulting in a rating of 4.1 out of 5 starts on Trustpilot as of March 2023, compared to an average review of 2.6 out of 5 stars for our two largest ecommerce peers. These positive experiences are expected to allow Shift to serve customers over the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership and retain customers for repeat sales and purchases. By continuing to invest in services that benefit the customer throughout the ownership phase of the lifecycle, we will continue to establish a long-term customer base that we expect will return for future transactions, thereby reducing our customer acquisition costs over time. 
 
 Broad Inventory Selection Including the Shift Value Segment : We believe that a differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers as compared to our competitors, who purchase a higher percentage through the wholesale market and OEMs, provides Shift access to a deeper pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory. In addition, our data-driven vehicle evaluations help ensure acquisition of the right inventory at the right price to reduce days to sale. 
 
 Our unique acquisition strategy allows us to offer inventory that includes a wide spectrum of ages and price, rather than focusing exclusively on newer and more expensive cars. We focus on vehicle models over five years old, with selling prices that are accessible to a broader array of customers. We also have a differentiated Shift Value segment of vehicles which are over eight years old or have more than 80,000 miles. This category of inventory is highly desirable to a large market segment, and counter-cyclical, with demand increasing in poor economic conditions. Our inventory is thus diverse enough and better positioned to weather a down economy and shifting consumer preferences. We believe that to be successful in the value segment, it is critical to own the reconditioning process in our markets and offer consumers a test drive option at a Shift location during the purchase process.

 Our Growth Strategies and Path to Profitability 
 
 During 2022, to improve the financial performance of the business and the Company s liquidity position, Shift implemented the Project Focus Restructuring Plan (the "Restructuring Plan") in August 2022 and acquired CarLotz in December 2022. The Restructuring Plan outlined a plan to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing operating expenses, and maximizing liquidity. 
 
 Improve Unit Economics: Our short-term priority is to achieve positive unit economics including customer acquisition costs through gross profit per unit ("GPU") expansion and leveraging selling and marketing expenses. To achieve this goal, first, we are carefully managing our vehicle acquisition costs in the volatile pricing environment using our proprietary software and algorithms. Second, we are optimizing marketing spend through focusing on lower-funnel activities to drive higher conversion and targeting more efficient customer acquisition channels. And third, we believe the addition of in-person selling as part of our omnichannel selling experience will drive higher conversion rates for cars and products. 
 
 Increase Market Penetration in Existing Markets: Our plan is to increase share in existing markets given the large and highly fragmented industry in which we operate. We are focused on our mature markets where we can leverage our large markets with reconditioning facilities and brand recognition to drive retail unit sales. We believe our omnichannel model has appeal to a broader base of customers who would like to have choice in how they transact. 
 
 Geographic Expansion : We currently operate three markets in California and Oregon. Over time, we will evaluate entering new markets that meet our requirements for regional market demand, desirable real estate to deliver our omnichannel experience, and estimated store economics. 
 
 Enhanced Cost Control: The Company has taken significant steps to right-size the cost structure for the omnichannel business model and will manage costs judiciously to achieve long-term profitable growth. 
 
 Support Vehicle Ownership Throughout the Entire Lifecycle and Capitalize on Ancillary Product Offering : We offer service, maintenance, and repair work at each of our three markets in an effort to support the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership. We seek to become the single company consumers think of every time they want to do anything with a car buy, sell, service or protect to make car ownership simple. The service and maintenance business has the opportunity to add recurring revenue and gross profit while increasing customer loyalty and reducing future customer acquisition costs. 
 
 Leverage Scalable Proprietary Marketplace and Logistics Platform : Not only do we use our technology to buy, sell, and maintain the cars we sell through our own markets, but we have also built modular, scalable proprietary technology solutions for a logistics management and mobile transactions platform that can be leveraged by other car sellers including other dealers. Our vision is to evolve into a true platform marketplace that lists and fulfills third-party inventory, enabling traditional dealers to modernize through this platform and those who might otherwise build a traditional dealership channel to make use of the Shift platform instead. By becoming the online destination for consumers who want to buy or sell a car, we also plan to become the platform for dealers who want to transact with those consumers. 
 
 Accelerate Growth Through Strategic M A : The market for used cars is highly fragmented. We intend to consider acquisitions that further our strategy of developing an omnichannel distribution platform, combining digital delivery and strategic retail presence. 
 
 Marketing 
 
 We believe our customer base is representative of the overall market for used cars as our vehicles cover the full spectrum of used car price points. Our sales and marketing efforts utilize a multi-channel approach, built on a seasonality-adjusted, market-based model budget. We direct marketing to both buyers and sellers, which is part of why we are able to acquire a majority of our inventory directly from customers. We believe our strong customer focus ensures customer loyalty which will drive both repeat purchases and referrals. We drive Buyer and Seller traffic to the Shift platform with SEM, Paid Social, SEO, and Affiliate programs. In addition, for Buyer, we also leverage third-party auto lead sources to drive traffic.

 Service Providers 
 
 We utilize several top banking partners to finance purchases of our vehicles by customers who desire or need such financing. We also offer value-added products to our customers through third-party partners, including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection and wheel and tire coverage. None of these third-party partners are individually significant to our operations. 
 
 Seasonality 
 We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on, among other things, consumers car buying patterns. We have typically experienced higher revenue growth rates in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in each of the first or fourth quarters of the calendar year. We believe these results are due to seasonal buying patterns driven in part by the timing of income tax refunds, which we believe are an important source of car buyer down payments on used vehicle purchases. However, we recognize that in the future our revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends (including any disruptions to normal seasonal trends arising from the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the automotive retail industry. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property through patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality agreements, other contractual commitments and security procedures. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our technology and other proprietary information. 
 
 We own one issued U.S. patent and have one pending U.S. patent application. We also have an application pending to register Shift as a trademark in the United States. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property. 
 
 Intellectual property laws, contractual commitments and security procedures provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and we have not sought patents or trademark registrations outside of the United States. Therefore, in other jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect certain of our proprietary technology, brands, or other intellectual property. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles are regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. We also are subject to state laws related to titling and registration and wholesale vehicle sales, and our sale of value-added products is subject to state licensing requirements, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws can vary significantly from state to state. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce and the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.

Table of Contents 

 State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our ecommerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. We are licensed as a dealer in California and Oregon and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under our California and Oregon licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however if we determine that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all. 
 
 Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All of our installment sale transactions are currently conducted under our California or Oregon dealer licenses. However, as we seek to expand to other states, we may be required to obtain additional licenses and our ability to do so cannot be assured. 
 
 In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. In connection with the closing of the merger, we are also now subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules. 
 
 For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 We maintain insurance policies to cover directors and officers liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers compensation, automobile, cyber, general liability and umbrella insurance. 
 
 All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. 
 
 Employees 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had an average of approximately 970 employees. As of March 30, 2023 we had approximately 360 full-time employees. As discussed further in Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, headcount has been reduced pursuant to a Restructuring Plan and scaled to match a reduced geographic footprint. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.

 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 General business and economic conditions, and risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, could adversely affect the market for used cars, which could reduce our sales and profitability. 
 The market for used cars in the United States is affected by general business and economic conditions. The United States economy often experiences periods of instability, and this volatility may result in reduced demand for our vehicles and value-added products, reduced spending on vehicles, the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of vehicles, and decreased consumer confidence to make discretionary purchases. Consumer purchases of vehicles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. 
 Purchases of used vehicles are discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of consumer credit, reductions in consumer confidence and fears of recession, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment. Increased environmental regulation has made, and may in the future make, the used vehicles that we sell more expensive and less desirable for consumers. 
 In the event of a sustained revenue decline suffered by participants in the automotive markets, our competitors may attempt to increase their sales by reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, car manufacturers may increase incentives to stimulate new car sales, and rental car companies may seek to reduce the sizes of their rental car fleets by selling vehicles, each of which may depress used car values. Additionally, increases in unemployment rates may increase the number of loan and lease defaults, leading to repossessions, which are typically then re-sold by lenders in the wholesale market, which also may depress used car values. While lower used vehicle prices reduce our cost of acquiring new inventory, lower prices could lead to reductions in the value of inventory we currently hold, which could have a negative impact on gross profit. Moreover, any significant changes in retail prices due to scarcity or competition for used vehicles could impact our ability to source desirable inventory for our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in fewer used-car sales and lower revenue. Furthermore, any significant increases in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins. 
 In addition, changing trends in consumer tastes, negative business and economic conditions and market volatility may make it difficult for us to accurately forecast vehicle demand trends, which could cause us to increase our inventory carrying costs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We participate in a highly competitive industry, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 As described in greater detail in Description of Business , our business is involved in the purchase and sale of used vehicles. Companies that provide listings, information, and lead generation, as well as car-buying and car-selling services designed to help potential customers and to enable dealers to reach these customers, produce significant competition to our business. Some of these companies include: 
 traditional used vehicle dealerships, including those which may increase investment in their technology and infrastructure in order to compete directly with our digital business model; 
 large, national car dealers, such as CarMax and AutoNation, which are expanding into online sales, including omnichannel offerings; 
 used car dealers or marketplaces that currently have existing ecommerce businesses or online platforms, such as Carvana and Vroom; 
 the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites such as Facebook, Craigslist.com, eBay Motors and Nextdoor.com; and 
 sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles which were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales. 
 Internet and online automotive sites, such as Google, Amazon, AutoTrader.com, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, Autobytel.com, TrueCar.com, CarGurus, and Cars.com, could change their models to directly compete with us. In addition, automobile manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen could change their sales models to better compete with our model through technology and infrastructure investments. While such enterprises may change their business models and endeavor to compete with us, the purchase and sale of used vehicles through ecommerce presents unique challenges. 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 Our competitors also compete in the online market through companies that provide listings, information, lead generation and car buying services designed to reach customers and enable dealers to reach these customers and providers of offline, membership-based car buying services such as the Costco Auto Program. We also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the traditional and ecommerce automotive retail industry with competing brands, business models and products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results. For example, traditional car dealers could transition their selling efforts to the internet, allowing them to sell vehicles across state lines and compete directly with our online offering and no-negotiating pricing model. 
 Our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their businesses, platforms, and related products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive automotive industry relationships, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to consumer needs with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our used vehicles and value-added products could substantially decline. 
 In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if our competitors develop business models, products or services with similar or superior functionality to our platform, it may adversely affect our business. Additionally, our competitors could use their political influence and increase lobbying efforts to encourage new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would prevent us from operating in certain markets. 
 We face significant challenges in establishing our software as a platform to be used by automotive dealers. 
 Our current business model relies in part upon the establishment of our ecommerce solutions as a platform to be used by existing automobile dealers, most of whom are not familiar with and have not used our software platform, and also may not recognize our brand and corporate identity. Acceptance of our software platform by automotive dealers will depend on many factors, including consumer acceptance of our software, price, reliability, performance, and service accessibility and effectiveness. In addition, some of our primary ecommerce competitors may offer a similar software platform to automobile dealers, which may make it more difficult for us to differentiate our offering, attract automobile dealers to our platform, and derive the results we hope to achieve from this channel. 
 We face a variety of risks associated with the operation of our inspection, reconditioning and storage facilities. 
 We operate our inspection, reconditioning and storage centers in California and Oregon. If we are unable to operate our inspection, reconditioning and storage centers efficiently, we could experience delivery delays, a decrease in the quality of our reconditioning services, delays in listing our inventory, additional expenses and loss of potential and existing customers and related revenues, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Moreover, our future growth depends in part on scaling and expanding our inspection and reconditioning operations. Our business model relies on centralized inspection, reconditioning and storage centers, which have an average radius of service equal to 2 hours of driving time. We anticipate that in order to expand our geographic footprint, we will need to open additional inspection, reconditioning and storage centers. If for any reason we are unable to expand our reconditioning operations as planned, this could limit our ability to expand our geographic footprint. 
 Additionally, our business model assumes that we will yield efficiencies from our internal inspection and reconditioning capability, but we also rely on third-party providers to perform inspection and reconditioning services for us to the extent we are not currently able to fully absorb those operations internally. If our third-party providers of inspection and reconditioning services are unable to provide those services reliably, we may experience delays in delivery and listing of our inventory. In addition, to the extent our third-party providers do not maintain the quality of our reconditioning services, we may suffer reputational harm and be subject to claims by consumers. In addition, if we are not able to meet our goals of bringing inspection and reconditioning fully in house, or if we are not able to obtain the efficiencies we expect to gain from doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, we are required to obtain approvals, permits and licenses from state regulators and local municipalities to operate our centers. We may face delays in obtaining the requisite approvals, permits, financing and licenses to operate our centers or we may not be able to obtain them at all. If we encounter delays in obtaining or cannot obtain the requisite approvals, permits, financing and licenses to operate our centers in desirable markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We rely on third-party carriers to transport our vehicle inventory throughout the United States. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with such carriers and with the transportation industry, many of which are out of our control. 
 We rely on third-party carriers to transport vehicles from auctions or individual sellers to our facilities, and then from our facilities to our customers. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, gasoline prices and lack of reliability of many independent carriers. In addition, our transportation costs may increase as carriers have increased prices. Our third-party carriers failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and decrease our inventory sales velocity, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, third-party carriers that deliver vehicles to our customers could adversely affect the customer experience if they do not perform to our standards of professionalism and courtesy, which could adversely impact our business (including our reputation), financial condition and results of operations. 
 The current geographic concentration where we provide reconditioning services and store inventory creates an exposure to local and regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We currently conduct our business through our inspection, reconditioning and storage centers in California and Oregon. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect areas where we operate or may operate in the future, particularly our facilities in California, a state that has experienced significant natural and other disasters in the past including earthquakes, wildfires and blackouts, could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Changes in demographics and population or severe weather conditions and other catastrophic occurrences in areas in which we operate or from which we obtain inventory may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties, loss of inventory, and delays in the delivery of vehicles to our customers. In addition, our geographic concentration means that changes in policy at the state level, including regulatory changes and government shutdowns in response to pandemics and other crises, may have more significant impact on our business. 
 If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences. 
 Our information technology has been and may in the future be subject to cyber-attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, theft, computer hacking, phishing, employee error or malfeasance or other security breaches or loss of service. Hackers and data thieves are becoming increasingly sophisticated and large-scale and complex automated attacks are becoming more prevalent. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our systems and the data stored on those systems also may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced, blocked or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and the data stored on or transmitted by those systems, including the data of our customers or business partners. Further, third parties that provide services to us, such as hosted solution providers, also could be a source of security risks in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Our technology infrastructure may be subject to increased risk of slowdown or interruption as a result of integration with third-party services, including cloud services, and/or failures by such third parties, which may be out of our control.

 The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential suppliers or players. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. Although we have insurance coverage for losses associated with cyber-attacks, as with all insurance policies, there are coverage exclusions and limitations, and our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible losses and claims, and we may still suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business (including reputational damage). We could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed U.S. laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection. In the event that we or our service providers are unable to prevent, detect, and remediate the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted, or we could incur financial, legal or reputational losses arising from misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information systems and networks, including personal information of our employees and our customers. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or employees of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls, and processes require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. 
 We may be subject to adverse impacts from the existence of copycat websites that attempt to defraud our potential customers. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, experience disruption in our business and adverse impacts to our brand from the posting by third parties of copycat websites that attempt to imitate the branding and functionality of our website and defraud our consumers. If we become aware of such activities, we intend to employ technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt these operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such activities or operations in a timely manner and, even if we do detect such activities or operations, our attempts and implementing technological measures and seeking legal recourse from appropriate governmental authorities may be insufficient to halt these operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of entities operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us or our consumers against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers, our brand and business could be materially harmed. 
 Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The protection of intellectual property, technology and confidential information is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property (including our brand, technology and confidential information). While it is our policy to protect and defend our rights to our intellectual property, we cannot predict whether steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violations of our intellectual property rights. We also cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop technology that has the same or similar functionality as our technology. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop competing solutions and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights may be difficult and may not be effective. Furthermore, we have faced and may in the future face claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property that could interfere with our ability to market, promote and sell our vehicles and related services. Any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could be costly, divert attention of management and may not ultimately be resolved in our favor. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from using certain intellectual property and may be liable for damages, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 As part of our efforts to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information, we require certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements, and we also require certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively grant all necessary rights to any inventions that may have been developed by our employees and consultants. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our ability to prevent others from using our technology. 
 We are currently the registrant of the shift.com internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain domain names that are important for our business. 
 In addition, the Shift trademark is important to our business. We may not be able to protect our rights in this trademark, which we need in order to build name recognition with consumers. If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our rights under this trademark, we may lose the ability to use it, or to prevent others from using it, which could adversely harm our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are actively seeking registration of the Shift trademark in the U.S., it is possible that others may assert senior rights to similar trademarks and seek to prevent our use and registration of our trademark in certain jurisdictions. In addition, registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. If third parties succeed in registering or developing common law rights in our trademarks or trade names, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks or trade names to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products or services. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively. Further, it is possible that our trademark Shift may be deemed to be generic and therefore ineligible for registration. If any of these events were to occur, our pending trademark application for Shift may not result in such mark being registered, which could adversely affect our branding, or require us to adopt new branding, which would cause us to incur increased marketing, infrastructure and capital expense, and all of which could adversely affect our business, financial performance and results of operations. In addition, even if we are able to protect our trademarks, scammers may attempt to mimic our website in order to defraud potential customers. 
 While software is protected under copyright law, we have chosen not to register any copyrights in our software. We also rely on trade secret law to protect our proprietary software. In order to bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States, the copyright would need to be registered. Accordingly, the remedies and damages available to us for unauthorized use of our software may be limited. Our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary materials may be revealed to the public or our competitors or independently developed by our competitors and no longer provide protection for the related intellectual property. Furthermore, our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary materials may be revealed to the public or our competitors or independently developed by our competitors and no longer provide protection for the related intellectual property. 
 We rely on third-party service providers to provide financing, as well as value-added products, to our customers, and we cannot control the quality or fulfillment of these products and services. 
 We rely on third-party lenders to finance purchases of our vehicles by customers who desire or need such financing. We also offer value-added products to our customers through third-party service providers, including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection GAP ), and wheel and tire coverage. Because we utilize third-party service providers, we cannot control all of the factors that might affect the quality and fulfillment of these services and products, including (i) lack of day-to-day control over the activities of third-party service providers, (ii) that such service providers may not fulfill their obligations to us or our customers or may otherwise fail to meet expectations, which in the case of vehicle service contracts, could require us to refund amounts paid or underwrite the risk ourselves, and (iii) that such service providers may terminate their arrangements with us on limited or no notice or may change the terms of these arrangements in a manner unfavorable to us for reasons outside of our control. Such providers also are subject to state and federal regulations and any failure by such third-party service providers to comply with applicable legal requirements could cause us financial or reputational harm.

 Our revenues and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. If one or more of these third-party service providers cease to provide these services or products to our customers, tighten their credit standards or otherwise provide services to fewer customers or are no longer able to provide them on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operations. If we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and results of operations. Delays or errors by these third-party service providers are not in the Company s control but may cause dissatisfaction with our customers that could result in reputational harm to us. In addition, disagreements with such third-party service providers could require or result in costly and time-consuming litigation or arbitration. 
 Moreover, we receive fees from these third-party service providers in connection with finance, service and vehicle protection products purchased by our customers. A portion of the fees we receive on such products is subject to chargebacks in the event of early termination, default or prepayment of the contracts by end-customers, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations. 
 Certain of our third-party service providers are highly regulated financial institutions, and the federal and state laws related to financial services could have a direct or indirect materially adverse effect on our business. 
 We have entered into agreements with various third-party financial institutions related to the financing by those institutions of our customers vehicle purchases as well as the provision of various value-added products. Our financial institution counterparties are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations related to the provision of financial services, and their ability to provide financing and other products and services could be materially limited or eliminated at any time as a result of financial regulatory or supervisory issues as well as changes in federal or state laws, regulations, or guidance related to the provision of financial services. In the event of such disruptions, our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable in a commercially reasonable manner to identify and enter into replacement arrangements with other institutions on substantially similar terms as those that exist with our current providers. Moreover, we are subject to contractual obligations requiring that we comply with, or help to facilitate compliance by our financial institution counterparties with, a broad range of regulatory requirements and obligations, including without limitation those related to customer data, data security, privacy, anti-money laundering, and the detection and prevention of financial crimes. The federal and state regulators responsible for implementing and enforcing these laws and regulations routinely examine our financial institution counterparties with respect to their compliance with such laws and regulations, including the extent to which these institutions third-party relationships may present compliance risks. Despite our best efforts to comply with all applicable regulatory and contractual obligations, it is possible that there could be some perceived or actual deficiency in our ability to adequately satisfy financial regulatory requirements or to serve as a contractual counterparty to a regulated financial institution. Any such perceived or actual deficiency or risk to a regulated financial institution could result in a disruption of our relationship with that institution as well as with other lenders and other financial services counterparties, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business. 
 If the quality of our customer experience, our reputation, or our brand were negatively affected, our business, sales, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our business model is based on our ability to enable consumers to buy and sell used vehicles through our ecommerce platform in a seamless, transparent and hassle-free transaction. If we fail to sustain a high level of integrity and our reputation suffers as a result, customers, partners, and vendors may lose trust in our business, and our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even if, despite our best efforts, there is a perceived deterioration in quality of our value proposition, our revenues and results of operations could decline. Additionally, to the extent our historic rapid growth continues in the future, it may become challenging to maintain the quality of our customer experience. 
 We operate a consumer-facing business and are likely to receive complaints or negative publicity about our business. For example, we may receive complaints about our business practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, vehicle quality, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, data privacy and security or other aspects of our business, especially on blogs and social media websites. Such complaints, irrespective of their validity, could diminish customer confidence in our vehicles, products, and services and adversely affect our reputation. If we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information about any aspect of our business in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

 Our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new vehicles as compared to the price of used vehicles. 
 If the prices of new vehicles decline relative to the prices of used vehicles, our customers may become more likely to purchase a new vehicle rather than a used vehicle, which could reduce our vehicle sales and lower our revenue. A potential contributing factor to the narrowing of the price gap between new and used vehicles is manufacturers providing incentives for the purchase of new vehicles, such as favorable financing terms. Additionally, factors that cause used vehicle prices to increase, such as a decrease in the number of new vehicle lease returns or a decrease in vehicle stock from rental car companies could cause consumers to favor the purchases of new vehicles. In addition, supply chain issues impacted new vehicle production throughout 2021 and 2022. As a result of these factors, automotive vehicle pricing and demand continues to be difficult to predict. 
 Our business and inventory are dependent on our ability to correctly appraise and price vehicles we buy and sell. 
 When purchasing a vehicle from us, our customers sometimes trade in their current vehicle and apply the trade-in value towards their purchase. We also acquire vehicles from consumers independent of any purchase of a vehicle from us. We appraise and price vehicles we buy and sell based on a field evaluation of the vehicle using data science and proprietary algorithms based on a number of factors, including mechanical soundness, consumer desirability and demand, vehicle history, market prices and relative value as prospective inventory. If we are unable to correctly appraise and price both the vehicles we buy and the vehicles we sell, we may be unable to acquire or sell inventory at attractive prices or to manage inventory effectively, and accordingly our revenue, gross margins and results of operations would be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, when a customer trades in their current vehicle and applies the trade-in value towards their purchase, our ability to effectively appraise the vehicle based on a field evaluation is important, as we believe that unwinding a transaction due to the discovery of a defect in the vehicle would negatively affect the customer s experience. 
 Our business is dependent upon access to desirable vehicle inventory. Obstacles to acquiring attractive inventory, whether because of supply, competition or other factors, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In the year ended December 31, 2022, we obtained 95 of the vehicles we sell in our retail segment from customers and partners. If we are unable to purchase a sufficient number of vehicles directly from consumer-sellers and our partners, we will need to find alternative sources of vehicles and we may not be able to purchase vehicles of the same quality and at the same price as the vehicles we currently purchase. A reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is dependent upon our ability to expeditiously sell inventory. Failure to expeditiously sell our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We regularly project demand for used vehicles purchased by customers on our platform and purchase inventory in accordance with those projections. If we fail to accurately project demand, we could experience an over-supply of used vehicle inventory that may create a downward pressure on our used vehicle sales prices and margins. As well, an over-supply of used vehicle inventory would be expected to increase the average number of days required to sell a unit of inventory. 
 Used vehicle inventory comprises the largest component of our total assets other than cash, and used vehicle inventories generally depreciate rapidly. An increase in the average number of days required to sell a unit of inventory could materially adversely impact our ability to liquidate inventory at prices that allow us to recover costs and generate profit. Additionally, an increase in the rate at which customers return vehicles, which in turn increases our used vehicle inventory, could have the same effect.

 Our ability to expand value-added product offerings and introduce additional products and services may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Currently, our third-party value-added products consist of finance and vehicle protection products, which includes third-party financing of customers vehicle purchases, as well as other value-added products, such as vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection, and wheel and tire coverage. If we introduce new value-added products or expand existing offerings on our platform, such as insurance and/or insurance referral services, music services or vehicle diagnostic and tracking services and maintenance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Entry into new markets may require us to compete with new companies, cater to new customer expectations, and comply with new complex regulations and licensing requirements, each of which will be unfamiliar. Accordingly, we could need to invest significant resources in market research, legal counsel, and our organizational infrastructure, and a return on such investments may not be achieved for several years, if at all. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain required licenses could result in penalties or fines. Further, we may fail in demonstrating the value of any new value-added product to customers, which would compromise our ability to successfully create new revenue streams or receive returns in excess of investments. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Vehicle retail sales depend heavily on affordable interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle financing and a substantial increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 If interest rates continue to rise, market rates for vehicle financing will generally be expected to rise as well, which may make our vehicles less affordable to customers or steer customers to less expensive vehicles that would be less profitable for us, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if consumer interest rates increase substantially or if financial service providers tighten lending standards or restrict their lending to certain classes of credit, customers may not desire or be able to obtain financing to purchase our vehicles. As a result, a substantial increase in customer interest rates or tightening of lending standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, as well as our actual or perceived failure to protect such information, could harm our reputation and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, and we rely in part on third parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations. For example, we rely on encryption, storage and processing technology developed by third parties to securely transmit, operate on and store such information. Due to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information and data we and these third parties manage and expect to manage in the future, as well as the nature of our customer base, the security features of our information systems are critical. We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and may need to expend more resources in the event we need to address problems caused by potential breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by customers and vendors could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have in the past experienced security vulnerabilities, though such vulnerabilities have not had a material impact on our operations. While we have implemented security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control and emergency recovery processes to mitigate risks like these with respect to information systems that are under our control, they are not fail-safe and may be subject to breaches. Further, we cannot ensure that third parties upon whom we rely for various services will maintain sufficient vigilance and controls over their systems. Our inability to use or access those information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of personal or confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, including our results of operations, and our reputation, as well as our relationships with our customers, employees or other individuals whose information may have been affected by such cybersecurity incidents.

 There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing and expanding as we move into new markets, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with, inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflicting with other rules. We are also subject to specific contractual requirements contained in third-party agreements governing our use and protection of personal information and other data. We generally seek to comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and the privacy- and security-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Additionally, new regulations could be enacted with which we are not familiar. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause customers, vendors and receivable-purchasers to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put customers or vendors information at risk and could in turn harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We expect that new industry standards, laws and regulations will continue to be proposed and implemented regarding privacy, data protection and information security where we do business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA ), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Further, if individual U.S. states pass data privacy laws that place different obligations or limitations on the processing of personal data of individuals in those states, it will become more complex to comply with these laws and our compliance costs may increase. 
 A significant data breach or any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any federal, state or local privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or other principles or orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, investigations, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other penalties or liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify users, law enforcement or payment companies about the incident and may need to provide some form of remedy, such as refunds, for the individuals affected by the incident. 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of these laws establish either a private right of action or permit private individuals and entities to enforce the same in the name of the relevant government entity. 
 Our business is and will continue to be subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, some of which are novel and without relevant precedent. Such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to: 
 state and local licensing requirements; 
 state and local titling and registration requirements; 
 state laws regulating the sale of motor vehicles and related products and services; 
 federal and state laws regulating vehicle financing; 
 federal and state consumer protection laws; and 
 federal and state data privacy laws.

 The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. We are also subject to a variety of federal laws that may require us to incur costs in order to be in compliance with such laws, including the United States Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA and any state equivalents. Additionally, we are subject to regulation and audit by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies and are subject to a variety of state laws, including California s Lemon Law. We are also subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities. 
 Our marketing and disclosure regarding the sale and servicing of vehicles is regulated by federal, state and local agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general. Some of these authorities either establish a private right of action or permit a private individual or entity to enforce on behalf of a state entity private attorney general ). We have in the past experienced claims under these laws, and we may experience additional claims in the future. 
 State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our ecommerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them, and we may face regulatory action if regulators believe that we are not in compliance with such obligations. We are licensed as a dealer in California and Oregon and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under our California and Oregon licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however regulators could seek to enforce those laws against us. In addition, if we determine or are instructed by state regulators that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all. 
 Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All vehicle sale transactions and applicable retail installment financings are conducted under our California and Oregon dealer licenses. As we seek to expand our operations and presence into other states, we may be required to obtain additional finance or other licenses, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses within the timeframe we expect or at all. 
 Any failure to renew or maintain any of the foregoing licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many aspects of our business are subject to regulatory regimes at the state and local level, and we may not have all licenses required to conduct business in every jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, as we expand nationally to operate in new jurisdictions, we may face regulatory action if regulators believe we are not compliant with local rules. Despite our belief that we are not subject to certain licensing requirements of those state and local jurisdictions, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those state and local jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those state and local jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the purchase and sale of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, credit and financing, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations. 
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change.

 Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: 
 changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 
 expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; 
 expiration of or detrimental changes in research and development tax credit laws; or 
 changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. 
 In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 We may require additional debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If such capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We expect to make significant capital investments to grow and innovate our business, and our response to business challenges and unforeseen circumstances may also require significant capital. To fund these expenditures, we may need to conduct equity or debt financings to secure additional liquidity. There is a risk that we may not be able to secure such additional liquidity in a timely manner, on terms which are acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. 
 As a result of a late Current Report on Form 8-K filing in 2023, we are not eligible to use our shelf registration statement for the remainder of the 2023 fiscal year. Because of that limitation, our ability to quickly access U.S. capital markets will be somewhat constrained. 
 Our flooring line of credit facility with Ally Bank expires on December 9, 2023. The Senior Unsecured Notes with SB LL Holdco will mature on May 11, 2025. Additionally, our Convertible Senior Notes mature on May 15, 2026. Please see Note 10 - Borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. The terms of any future debt financing may be on less favorable economic terms or include restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to secure additional liquidity and pursue business opportunities. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing and may impact the ability or willingness of our lenders or guarantors to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may be forced to obtain financing on undesirable terms or our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Future sales or issuances of equity securities could decrease the value of our common stock, dilute investors voting power and reduce our earnings per share. 
 We may sell additional equity securities in subsequent offerings (including through the sale of securities convertible into equity securities and may issue equity securities in acquisitions). We cannot predict the size of future issuances of equity securities or the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into equity securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. 
 Additional issuances of our securities may involve the issuance of a significant number of common stock at prices less than the current market price for the common stock. Issuances of substantial numbers of common stock, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued common stock, or securities convertible into common stock, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to security holders.

 Sales of substantial amounts of our securities by us or our existing shareholders, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities and dilute investors earnings per share. Exercises of presently outstanding share options or warrants may also result in dilution to security holders. A decline in the market prices of our securities could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. 
 As of March 30, 2023, we had outstanding approximately 17,228,479 shares of our common stock and securities exercisable for and convertible into approximately 2,533,116 shares of common stock (of which approximately 521,969 were exercisable as of that date). We also had convertible debt outstanding that is convertible into a maximum of 2,269,289 shares of our common stock. The sale or the availability for sale of a large number of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 There is no assurance we will continue to meet the Nasdaq listing standards. 
 We must meet continuing listing standards to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. If we fail to comply with listing standards and Nasdaq delists our common stock, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; 
 reduced liquidity for our common stock; 
 a determination that our common stock are penny stock, which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possible result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 
 a limited amount of news about us and analyst coverage of us; and 
 a decreased ability for us to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. 
 If we fail to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, we may face significant damages, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We utilize telephone calls and text messages as a means of responding to and marketing to customers interested in purchasing, trading in and/or selling vehicles and value-added products. We generate leads from our website and online advertising by prompting potential customers to provide their phone numbers so that we can contact them in response to their interest in selling a vehicle, purchasing a vehicle, trading in a vehicle or obtaining financing terms. We must ensure that our SMS texting practices comply with regulations and agency guidance under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA ), a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with the TCPA, the Federal Communications Commission, as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our SMS texting practices violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business.

 Government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business model relies extensively on the internet and ecommerce, and accordingly we are subject to laws and regulations which specifically govern the internet and ecommerce. The evolution of existing laws and regulations, and the passage of new laws and regulations, could limit how we can use the internet and ecommerce and in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These laws and regulations may affect a number of aspects of our business, including taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or ecommerce. Similarly, existing laws governing state regulation of automotive dealers largely predate the advent of the internet and it is not clear how these laws apply to ecommerce automotive retailers. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the internet or ecommerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one market segment to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. For example, federal, state and local regulation regarding privacy, data protection and information security has become more significant, and proposed or newly implemented regulations such as the CCPA may increase our costs of compliance. We cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, decreased revenues and increased expenses. 
 We actively use anonymous online data for targeting ads online and if ad networks are compelled by regulatory bodies to limit use of this data, it could materially affect our ability to do effective performance modeling. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our sites by customers and suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary liability. We also may be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue and expand our business as anticipated. 
 If we do not adequately address our customers desire to utilize mobile device technology, our results of operations could be harmed and our growth could be negatively affected. 
 Shift.com is a mobile-friendly website that consumers can access and utilize from their mobile devices. As customers rely more on mobile technology for buying and selling products and services, the future success of our business will be significantly driven by our ability to provide an effective and customer-friendly mobile application for buying and selling used vehicles. The shift to mobile technology by our users may harm our business in the following ways: 
 customers visiting our website from a mobile device may not accept mobile technology as a viable long-term platform to buy or sell a vehicle. This may occur for a number of reasons, including our ability to provide the same level of website functionality to a mobile device that we provide on a desktop computer, the actual or perceived lack of security of information on a mobile device and possible disruptions of service or connectivity; 
 we may be unable to provide sufficient website functionality to mobile device users, which may cause customers using mobile devices to believe that our competitors offer superior products and features; 
 problems may arise in developing applications for alternative devices and platforms and the need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such applications; or 
 regulations related to consumer finance disclosures, including the Truth in Lending Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, may be interpreted, in the context of mobile devices, in a manner which could expose us to legal liability in the event we are found to have violated applicable laws. 
 If customers do not respond positively to using our mobile application, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.

 We are subject to risks related to online payment methods. 
 We accept payments, including payments on deposits and on recurring payments that are due to us, through a variety of methods, including credit card and debit card through a third-party processor. As we offer new payment options to customers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements or fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. As our business changes, we also may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from customers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 We occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data, including stolen credit card numbers, or from clients who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in open bank accounts to satisfy payment obligations. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. If we are unable to detect or control credit card or other fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our future growth and profitability rely heavily on the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing and branding efforts, and these efforts may not be successful. 
 We rely heavily on marketing and advertising to attract new customers, connect with existing customers, and further build our brand and reputation. A significant amount of our operating expenses are and will continue to be attributed to marketing and advertising, but there is no assurance that we will achieve a significant, or even positive, return on our investment on such expenditures, or that such expenditures will be otherwise effective. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on: 
 the effectiveness of our performance-based digital marketing efforts; 
 the effectiveness and efficiency of our online advertising and search marketing programs in generating consumer awareness of, and sales on, our platform; 
 our ability to prevent confusion among customers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use or bid on our trademarks to direct customers to competitors websites; 
 our ability to prevent internet publication of false or misleading information regarding our platform or our competitors offerings; and 
 the effectiveness of our direct-to-consumer advertising to reduce our dependency on third-party aggregation websites. 
 We currently advertise primarily through a blend of direct-advertising channels and are expanding our brand advertising channels in the future with the goal of increasing the strength, recognition and trust in the Shift brand and driving more unique visitors to our platform. Our marketing strategy includes performance marketing through digital platforms, including both auto-centric lead generation platforms and broader consumer-facing platforms. We have also strategically use targeted television and radio campaigns and other local advertising in key markets. As such, a significant component of our marketing spend involves the use of various marketing techniques, including programmatic ad-buying, interest targeting, retargeting and email nurturing. Future growth and profitability will depend in part on the cost and efficiency of our promotional advertising and marketing programs and related expenditures, including our ability to create greater awareness of our platform and brand name, to appropriately plan for future expenditures, and to drive the promotion of our platform.

 We rely on internet search engines, vehicle listing sites and social networking sites to help drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results or fail to drive traffic through paid advertising, our traffic would decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We depend in part on internet search engines, such as Google and Bing, vehicle listing sites, and social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram, to drive traffic to our website. Our ability to maintain and increase the number of visitors directed to our platform is not entirely within our control. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user s search, which could reduce the number of organic visits to our websites, in turn reducing new client acquisition and adversely affecting our operating results. Our competitors may increase their search engine marketing efforts and outbid us for placement on various vehicle listing sites or for search terms on various search engines, resulting in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Additionally, internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If internet search engines modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, if vehicle listing sites refuse to display any or all of our inventory in certain geographic locations, or if our competitors efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our customer base could slow or our customer base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide automotive dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Our platform has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. We could reach a point of inventory saturation at third-party aggregation websites whereby we will exceed the maximum allowable inventory that will require us to spend greater than market rates to list our inventory. 
 In addition, social networks are important as a source of new clients and as a means by which to connect with current clients, and their importance may be increasing. We may be unable to effectively maintain a presence within these networks, which could lead to lower than anticipated brand affinity and awareness, and in turn could adversely affect our operating results. Further, mobile operating system and web browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced or recently implemented product changes to limit the ability of advertisers to collect and use data to target and measure advertising. For example, Apple recently made a change to iOS 14 to require apps to get a user s opt-in permission before tracking or sharing the user s data across apps or websites owned by companies other than the app s owner. Google further restricted the use of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser in 2022, consistent with similar actions taken by the owners of other browsers, such as Apple in its Safari browser, and Mozilla in its Firefox browser. These changes are expected to reduce our ability to efficiently target and measure advertising, in particular through online social networks, making our advertising less cost effective and successful. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our platform through internet search engines, vehicle listings sites or social networking sites could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business relies on email and other messaging services, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or messages or an inability to timely deliver such communications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is dependent in part upon email and other messaging services for promoting our platform and vehicles available for purchase. Promotions offered through email and other messages sent by us are an important part of our marketing strategy. We provide emails to customers and other visitors informing them of the convenience and value of using our platform, as well as updates on new inventory and price updates on listed inventory, and we believe these emails, coupled with our general marketing efforts, are an important part of our customer experience and help generate revenue. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails or other messages to our subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open our emails or other messages, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. Any changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may reduce the number of subscribers opening our emails. For example, Google s Gmail service has a feature that organizes incoming emails into categories (such as primary, social and promotions). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a subscriber s inbox or viewed as spam by our subscribers and may reduce the likelihood of that subscriber opening our emails.

 In addition, actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of emails or other messages could also adversely impact our business. From time to time, internet service providers or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver email or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit our ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon us in connection with sending such communications could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our use of email and other messaging services to send communications about our sites or other matters may also result in legal claims against us, which may cause us to incur increased expenses, and if successful might result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations or might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or other messages. We also rely on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking services by customers and potential customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations are likely and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, cash flow, and net profit or loss, to vary significantly in the future based in part on, among other things, seasonal and cyclical patterns in vehicle sales in the United States. Vehicle sales generally exhibit seasonality, with sales increasing in the first quarter and continuing through the end of the summer, before exhibiting a steep drop in the fall. This seasonality historically corresponds with the timing of income tax refunds, which can provide a primary source of funds for customers payments on used vehicle purchases. Used vehicle prices also exhibit seasonality, with used vehicles depreciating at a faster rate in the last two quarters of each year and a slower rate in the first two quarters of each year. COVID-19 and related supply chain disruptions have somewhat disrupted these seasonal patterns in 2021 and 2022, posing additional challenges to buying and selling inventory at favorable prices. 
 Additionally, a significant portion of our expenses are fixed and do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues. In total, our results in any quarter may not be indicative of the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year, and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. 
 Changes in the auto industry may threaten our business model if we are unable to adapt. 
 The market for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant, and likely accelerating, changes to the broader automotive industry, which may render our existing or future business model or our ability to sell vehicles, products, and services less competitive, unmarketable, or obsolete. Consumer purchases of new and used vehicles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. For example, the number of used vehicle sales in the United States decreased from approximately 41.4 million in 2007 to approximately 35.5 million in 2009, according to CNW Research Retail Automotive Summary. Purchases of new and used vehicles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy and other factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates, the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility, increased regulation and increased unemployment. Increased environmental regulation has made, and may in the future make, used vehicles more expensive and less desirable for consumers. In addition, ride-hailing and ride-sharing services are becoming increasingly popular as a means of transportation and may decrease consumer demand for the used vehicles we sell, particularly as urbanization increases. The availability of ride-hailing and ride-sharing services may also encourage urban consumers to rely on public transportation, bicycles and other alternatives to car ownership. More long-term technology is currently being developed to produce automated, driverless vehicles that could reduce the demand for, or replace, traditional vehicles, including the used vehicles that we acquire and sell. Furthermore, new technologies such as autonomous driving software have the potential to change the dynamics of vehicle ownership in the future. If we are unable to or otherwise fail to successfully adapt to such industry changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 Our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers, including manufacturer recalls. 
 Adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could impact our supply of used vehicles. In addition, manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. In the instance of an open recall, we may have to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory and may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner or at all. Because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recall-related repairs, some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls. Such recalls, and our lack of authorization to make recall-related repairs or potential unavailability of parts needed to make such repairs, could (i) adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations, (ii) cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory, (iii) cause us to sell any affected vehicles at a loss, (iv) force us to incur increased costs and (v) expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Prospective purchasers of vehicles may choose not to shop online, which would prevent us from growing our business. 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional customers who have historically purchased vehicles through traditional dealers. The online market for vehicles is significantly less developed than the online market for other goods and services such as books, music, travel and other consumer products. If this market does not gain widespread acceptance, our business may suffer. Furthermore, we may have to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures or offer more incentives than we currently anticipate in order to attract additional consumers to our platform and convert them into purchasing customers. Specific factors that could prevent consumers from purchasing vehicles through our ecommerce platform include: 
 pricing that does not meet consumer expectations; 
 delayed deliveries; 
 inconvenience with returning or exchanging vehicles purchased online; 
 concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of personal information; and 
 usability, functionality and features of our platform. 
 If the online market for vehicles does not continue to develop and grow, our business will not grow and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, while we have experienced increased ecommerce sales during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can offer no assurance that these increased levels will be sustained following the cessation of the pandemic. 
 Our business is subject to the risk of natural disasters, adverse weather events and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism. 
 Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, global pandemics, human errors and similar events. The third-party systems and operations on which we rely are subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism could also cause disruptions in our businesses, consumer demand or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as if a natural disaster affects locations that store a significant amount of our inventory vehicles. As we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, any disruptions in the same could negatively affect our ability to run our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

 We could be negatively affected if losses for which we do not have third-party insurance coverage increase or our insurance coverages prove to be inadequate. 
 We maintain third-party insurance coverage, subject to limits, for risks that we face in the operation of our business that we believe is reasonable and customary for businesses of our size and type. Nevertheless, we may incur losses that we are unable to insure against or with respect to matters for which we have determined that obtaining insurance is not economical. Claims filed against us in excess of insurance limits, or for which we are otherwise self-insured, or the inability of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These risks include the risk of theft or destruction of the vehicles we own, which account for a substantial percentage of our net assets. In addition, insurance we maintain may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us and such coverage may not be adequate to cover the types of liabilities actually incurred. A significant loss, if not covered by available insurance coverage, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed. 
 We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees. The Company s success is highly dependent on its continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel and employees. The competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business. In periods of higher activity, it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified employees which could limit growth, increase operating costs, or have other material adverse effects on our operations. In addition, the loss of any of our key employees or senior management could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of new variants, our hiring, training, and retention efforts may be hindered by the constraints placed on our business, including measures that we take proactively and those that are imposed upon us by government authorities. As a result of such measures, it is possible that we may lose a portion of our workforce. In addition, labor shortages, the inability to hire or retain qualified employees nationally, regionally or locally or increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to control expenses and efficiently conduct operations. 
 Increases in labor costs, including wages, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The labor costs associated with our operations, including our inspection, reconditioning and storage centers, are subject to many external factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, potential collective bargaining arrangements, health insurance costs and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor legislation or other workplace regulation. From time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the minimum wage in a number of individual states and municipalities, and to reform entitlement programs, such as health insurance and paid leave programs. As minimum wage rates increase or related laws and regulations change, our labor costs may increase. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or if we fail to pay such higher wages we could suffer increased employee turnover. Increases in labor costs could force us to increase prices, which could adversely impact our sales. If competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Various federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, employee and independent contractor classification rules, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules, healthcare laws, scheduling notification requirements and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. While the scope of these laws and regulations are subject to change in all jurisdictions, California routinely makes changes to the scope of such laws and regulations, many of which may be strictly enforced, and some of which have been in the past, and may be in the future, implemented on a retrospective basis (meaning we may not have an opportunity to change our employment practices in advance to avoid non-compliance). Complying with these laws and regulations, including ongoing changes thereto, subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. In particular, we have been subject to employment litigation with respect to classification and wage and hour issues in the past. While we have not incurred material losses with respect to this litigation in the past, we may be subject to material claims in the future. 
 We rely on third-party technology and information systems to complete critical business functions. If that technology fails to adequately serve our needs, and we cannot find alternatives, it may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely on third-party technology for certain of our critical business functions, including customer identity verification for financing, transportation fleet telemetry, network infrastructure for hosting our website and inventory and supply chain data, software libraries, development environments and tools, services to allow customers to digitally sign contracts and customer experience center management. Our business is dependent on the integrity, security and efficient operation of these systems and technologies. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party vendors and partners could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, acts of terrorism, human error, vandalism or sabotage, financial insolvency, bankruptcy and similar events. The failure of these systems to perform as designed, the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary, the vulnerability of these systems to security breaches or attacks or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities, and our inability to find suitable alternatives could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our platform utilizes open-source software, and any defects or security vulnerabilities in the open-source software could negatively affect our business. 
 Our platform employs open-source software, and we expect to use open-source software in the future. To the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of open-source software, any undetected errors or defects in this open-source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay the introduction of new solutions, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation. For example, undetected errors or defects in open-source software could render it vulnerable to breaches or security attacks, and, in conjunction, make our systems more vulnerable to data breaches. 
 In addition, the terms of various open-source licenses are sometimes ambiguous and have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. Some open-source licenses might require us to make our source code available at no cost or require us to make our source code publicly available for modifications or derivative works if our source code is based upon, incorporates, or was created using the open-source software. While we try to insulate our proprietary code from the effects of such open-source license provisions, we cannot guarantee we will be successful. In addition to risks related to open-source license requirements, usage of open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licenses generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open-source software cannot be eliminated and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 
 Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
 In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the creation or development of intellectual property on our behalf to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in having all such employees and contractors execute such an agreement. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties or defend claims that they may bring against us to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. 
 We may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. 
 We are also at risk of claims by others that we have infringed their copyrights, trademarks, or patents, or improperly used or disclosed their trade secrets. The costs of supporting any litigation or disputes related to these claims can be considerable, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve a favorable outcome of any such claim. If any such claims are valid, we may be compelled to cease our use of such intellectual property and pay damages, which could adversely affect our business. Even if such claims are not valid, defending them could be expensive and distracting, adversely affecting our operating results. 
 A significant disruption in service on our platform could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers, which could harm our brand or our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our brand, reputation and ability to attract customers depend on the reliable performance of our platform and the supporting systems, technology and infrastructure. We may experience significant interruptions to our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the availability of our inventory on our platform and prevent or inhibit the ability of customers to access our platform. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of customers and result in additional costs. 
 Problems faced by our third-party web-hosting providers, such as AWS and Google Cloud, could inhibit the functionality of our platform. For example, our third-party web-hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice or suffer interruptions in service caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters or other phenomena. Disruption of their services could cause our website to be inoperable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by our third-party web-hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. In addition, if our third-party web-hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. 
 Any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our platform could interrupt our customers access to our inventory and our access to data that drives our inventory purchase operations, which could harm our reputation or our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have recognized impairment charges related to long-lived assets. 
 We are required to test intangible assets with an indefinite life and other long-lived assets for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of long-lived assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown or deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance or future outlook, or if the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sufficient cash to fulfill our obligations under such indebtedness, to react to changes in our business and to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding 150.0 million in principal amount under Senior Convertible Notes which mature on May 15, 2026, as well as 20.0 million in principal amount under Senior Unsecured Notes due May 11, 2025. Additionally, we had 24.8 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our Flooring Line of Credit with Ally Bank (as defined in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2022, which expires on December 9, 2023 (the "Ally FLOC"). Our interest expense resulting from indebtedness outstanding from time to time during fiscal 2022 was 11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure, refinance or replace our current or future debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or replacement of our existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require it to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis or failure to comply with certain restrictions in its debt instruments, including the maintenance of certain liquidity requirements that further restrict its cash usage, would result in a default under its debt instruments. In the event of a default under any of our current or future debt instruments, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debt instruments to be due and payable. Furthermore, our flooring line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains customary restrictive covenants which, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets and/or use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate any such dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that it could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. 
 In addition, our indebtedness under our flooring line of credit bears interest at variable rates. Because we have variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect its cash flows or business, financial condition and results of operations. We may attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. 
 We currently rely on an agreement with Ally Bank to finance our vehicle inventory purchases under our Flooring Line of Credit. If our relationship with this lender were to terminate, and we fail to acquire alternative sources of funding to finance our vehicle inventory purchases, we may be unable to maintain sufficient inventory, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely on a revolving credit agreement with Ally to finance our vehicle inventory purchases under our flooring line of credit will Ally Bank. Outstanding borrowings are due as financed vehicles are sold, and the flooring line of credit is secured by our vehicle inventory and certain other assets. If we are unable to maintain our flooring line of credit, which expires in December 2023, absent renewal, on favorable terms or at all, or if the agreement is terminated or expires and is not renewed with our existing third-party lender or we are unable to find a satisfactory replacement, our inventory supply may decline, resulting in fewer vehicles available for sale on our website. Moreover, new funding arrangements may be at higher interest rates or subject to other less favorable terms. These financing risks, in addition to potential rising interest rates and changes in market conditions, if realized, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.

 Risks Relating to Our Securities 
 Our common stock price may be volatile and the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance. 
 It is possible that an active trading market for shares of our common stock will not be sustained. If an active trading market for our common stock is not sustained, the liquidity of our common stock, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock when desired and the prices that you may obtain for your shares of common stock will be adversely affected. 
 Many factors, some of which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and this prospectus, as well as the following: 
 our operating and financial performance and prospects; 
 our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations; 
 conditions that impact demand for our offerings and platform, including demand in the automotive industry generally and the performance of the third parties through whom we conduct significant parts of our business; 
 future announcements concerning our business or our competitors businesses; 
 the public s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; 
 coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations; 
 market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; 
 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 
 changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us; 
 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 
 changes in senior management or key personnel; 
 issuances, exchanges, sales or stock splits, or expected issuances, exchanges, sales or stock splits of our capital stock; 
 changes in our dividend policy; 
 adverse resolution of new or pending litigation or other claims against us; and 
 changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, global pandemics, acts of war and responses to such events. 
 As a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the public offering price. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many ecommerce and other technology companies stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies operating performance, and because of these fluctuations, comparing companies operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.

 In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention. In addition, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. 
 We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, industry trends and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Any such decision also will be subject to compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our current indebtedness. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness, the terms of which may further restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. As a result, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock after price appreciation in order to generate cash flow from your investment, which you may not be able to do. Our inability or decision not to pay dividends could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock. 
 Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. 
 The issuance by us of additional shares of common stock or convertible securities may dilute your ownership of us and could adversely affect our stock price. 
 We may issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We also expect to continue to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. From time to time in the future, we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock pursuant to a variety of transactions, including acquisitions. The issuance by us of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would dilute your ownership of us and the sale of a significant amount of such shares in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. 
 Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. 
 The sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Concentrated sales of our common stock by these employees and other shareholders following the expiration of the lock-up restrictions or upon the triggering of the early release thresholds, if triggered, could harm the price of our common stock.

 Anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and depress the market price of our common stock. 
 Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Among others, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include the following provisions: 
 limitations on convening special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes; 
 advance notice procedures, which apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; 
 no authorization of cumulative voting, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 
 provides for a classified board of directors; and 
 the authorization of undesignated or blank check preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders. 
 These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), which prevents interested stockholders, such as certain stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless (i) prior to the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder, the board approved the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned 85 of the common stock or (iii) following board approval, the business combination receives the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such interested stockholder. 
 Any provision of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 
 If our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we provide to the public, the market price of our common stock may decline. 
 We may, but are not obligated to, provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will be comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this prospectus and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline. Even if we do issue public guidance, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future.

 If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. 
 Our stock price and trading volume are heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, regardless of accuracy, our common stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If the number of analysts that cover us declines, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Even if our common stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. Over-reliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may result in forecasts that differ significantly from our own. Regardless of accuracy, unfavorable interpretations of our financial information and other public disclosures could have a negative impact on our stock price. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates, for any of the reasons discussed above or otherwise, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. 
 As a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC regarding our internal control over financial reporting. If we continue to fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner. 
 We are a public reporting company subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel. 
 In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(a) requires that management assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, Section 404(b) requires our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404(a) has and will continue to require that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. 
 If we are unable to establish effective internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as it is required to do so, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, causing the price of our common stock to decline. 
 
 We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 
 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to an insufficiency of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of generally accepted accounting principles commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements and the complexity of the Company s operations and transactions. Remediation efforts undertaken by the Company in 2021 identified an additional material weakness related to insufficient selection and development of Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs). 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 While we are in the process of implementing a remediation plan to remediate these material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that the material weaknesses will be promptly remediated or that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in the future. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, "Controls and Procedures" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The Company s losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, its current cash and working capital position, and the upcoming expiration of the floorplan financing arrangement raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Since inception, the Company has generated recurring losses which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of 612.8 million as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had negative operating cash flows of 110.4 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 96.2 million and total working capital of 83.1 million. Our current floorplan financing arrangement expires on December 9, 2023. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. However, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing or generate profitable operations. Historically, we have funded operations through issuances of common and preferred stock and through a reverse recapitalization via the IAC Merger in October 2020, as well as through inventory floorplan financing and net cash received as part of out merger with CarLotz Inc in December 2022. We have also historically funded vehicle inventory purchases through our vehicle floorplan facilities. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms. The inclusion of disclosures expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern could materially adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise new capital or enter into strategic alliances. 
 Acquisitions such as the Fair acquisition, CarLotz merger, joint ventures and other strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business; we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions. 
 In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, from time to time we may make strategic acquisitions and enter into joint ventures and other strategic alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties relating to these transaction and any other acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances we may undertake include: 
 the difficulty in combining, integrating and managing newly acquired businesses or any businesses of a joint venture or strategic alliance in an efficient and effective manner; 
 the challenges in achieving the objectives, cost savings, synergies and other benefits expected from such transactions; 
 the risk of diverting resources and the attention of senior management from the operations of our business; 
 additional demands on management related to integration efforts or the increase in the size and scope of our company following an acquisition or to the complexities of a joint venture or strategic alliance, including challenges of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations and addressing differences in corporate cultures or management philosophies; 
 difficulties in the assimilation and retention of key employees and in maintaining relationships with present and potential customers, distributors and suppliers; 
 the lack of unilateral control over a joint venture or strategic alliance and the risk that joint venture or strategic partners have business goals and interests that are not aligned with ours, or the failure of a joint venture partner to satisfy its obligations or its bankruptcy or malfeasance; 
 costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities of an acquired business; 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 delays, difficulties or unexpected costs in the integration, assimilation, implementation or modification of platforms, systems, functions (including corporate, administrative, information technology, marketing and distribution functions), technologies, infrastructure, and product and service offerings of the acquired business, joint venture or strategic alliance, or in the harmonization of standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies; 
 the risk that funding requirements of the acquired business, joint venture or combined company may be significantly greater than anticipated; 
 the risks of entering markets in which we have less experience; and 
 the risks of disputes concerning indemnities and other obligations that could result in substantial costs. 
 We may not achieve the anticipated growth, cost savings or other benefits from the Fair acquisition, CarLotz merger or any other transaction we may undertake without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. Moreover, the anticipated growth, cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the Fair acquisition, CarLotz merger, or any other transaction we may undertake may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may inherit legal, regulatory, and other risks of the acquired business, whether known or unknown to us, which may be material to the combined company. Moreover, uncertainty about the effect of a pending transaction on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us and/or the acquired business, which uncertainties may impair our or its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause our or its customers, suppliers and distributors to seek to change existing business relationships with either of us. In addition, in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances, we may incur debt, issue equity securities, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could cause our earnings per share to decline. 
 In addition, companies such as Fair that are private companies at the time of acquisition are not subject to reporting requirements and may not have accounting personnel specifically employed to review internal controls over financial reporting and other procedures or to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Bringing the legacy systems for these businesses into compliance with those requirements and integrating them into our compliance and accounting systems may cause us to incur substantial additional expense, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. 
 Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and any strategic investments we make may not meet our financial or other investment objectives. Any failure to do so could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our Restructuring Plan and the associated workforce reduction may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. 
 In August 2022, we announced a reduction in workforce by approximately 60 in connection with the Restructuring Plan to prioritize and focus on improving unit economics and reducing selling, general and administrative costs. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our operating structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our operating results and financial condition, and cash flows would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional workforce reductions or restructuring activities in the future. 
 Furthermore, our strategic Restructuring Plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our workforce reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, increased difficulties in our day-to-day operations and reduced employee morale. If employees who were not affected by the reduction in force seek alternate employment, this could result in us needing to seek contract support at unplanned additional expense or harm our productivity. Our workforce reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel who are critical to our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel.

Item 2. Properties 
 Shift's corporate headquarters is located in San Francisco, California, and consists of approximately 9,255 square feet of space under a lease that expires on December 31, 2023. These facilities provide corporate functions and support, including meeting space and mail services, to our primarily remote workforce. 
 Shift operates three omnichannel markets including vehicle storage and sales facilities located in Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California, and Portland, Oregon. Following the Restructuring Plan described in detail in Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain legacy Shift facilities in California, Washington, and Texas are no longer in use. Following the merger with CarLotz, Inc. (see Note 3 - Business Combinations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), the Company has facilities that are not in use in Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The Company is actively engaged in efforts to dispose of the properties not in use. The Company's leases expire between January 1, 2023 and December 30, 2036. 
 We believe our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Other than the matter discussed below, Management is not currently aware of any matters that will have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 
 Stifel matter 
 On May 7, 2021, we were named in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Inc. v. Shift Technologies, Inc. 21-cv-04135) by a former financial advisor, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Inc. Stifel ), claiming that we are required to pay the former financial advisor certain compensation as a result of the IAC Merger. In addition, the complaint seeks punitive damages as a result of alleged unjust enrichment for the amount of the benefits allegedly conferred on Shift by Stifel. On August 24, 2022, Stifel's suit was dismissed with prejudice. On September 16, 2022, Stifel filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and formally filed its appeal with the Second Circuit on January 20, 2023. Shift has until April 20, 2023 to file its responsive pleading. Following the dismissal of Stifel's initial suit, the probable incurred losses related to the claim are immaterial as of December 31, 2022. Based on such information as is available to us, the range of additional reasonably possible losses related to the claim does not exceed 4.0 million, excluding any punitive damages which the Company cannot currently estimate. The Company believes the claim is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its defense. 
 CarLotz stockholder matters 
 On November 4, 2022, a lawsuit entitled Derek Dorrien v. CarLotz, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09463, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against CarLotz and the members of the CarLotz board of directors (the Dorrien Action ). On November 4, 2022, a lawsuit entitled Sholom D. Keller v. CarLotz, Inc. et al., Case No. 2022-1006-NAC, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against CarLotz and the members of the CarLotz board of directors (the Keller Action and together with the Dorrien Action, the Actions ). The Dorrien Action alleges that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by, among other things, omitting certain allegedly material information with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Transactions in the registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 26, 2022. The Keller Action alleges that the members of the CarLotz board of directors and Lev Peker, in his capacity as an officer of CarLotz, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Transactions. The Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief, money damages and the costs of the Actions, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. Shift is not named as a defendant in the Actions. We believe that the plaintiffs allegations in the Actions are without merit; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that CarLotz s or our defense of the action will be successful. 
 In addition, on October 3, 2022, a purported stockholder of CarLotz sent a demand to CarLotz and us regarding the Registration Statement (the CarLotz Stockholder Demand ). The CarLotz Stockholder Demand alleges the Registration Statement omits material information with respect to the Transactions and demands that CarLotz, the CarLotz board of directors, and Shift provide corrective disclosures. Shift disagrees with and intends to vigorously defend against any claim, if asserted, arising from the CarLotz Stockholder Demand. 
 Delaware Section 205 Petition 
 On March 6, 2023, Shift filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL to resolve potential uncertainty with respect to the Company s share capital. Such uncertainty was introduced by a recent decision in Garfield v. Boxed, Inc., 2022 WL 17959766 (Del. Ch. Dec. 27, 2022) that potentially affects the Company and many other similarly situated companies that were formed and became publicly traded as a special purpose acquisition company SPAC ). Out of an abundance of caution, the Company elected to pursue the remedial actions described below. Concurrently with the filing of the Petition, the Company filed a motion to expedite the hearing on the Petition, which was subsequently granted on March 6, 2023.

 In October 2020, the Company, which was then a SPAC named Insurance Acquisition Corp. IAC ), held a special meeting of stockholders (the IAC Special Meeting to approve certain matters relating to the merger between IAC and a privately held company then called Shift Technologies, Inc. One of these matters was a proposal to amend and restate IAC s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the SPAC Charter in order to, among other things, increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 50,000,000 to 500,000,000 (such proposal, the Share Increase Proposal and, together with such other amendments to the SPAC Charter, the Charter Proposals ). At the IAC Special Meeting, the Charter Proposals were approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock of IAC as of the record date for the IAC Special Meeting, voting together as a single class. After the IAC Special Meeting, IAC and Shift Technologies, Inc. closed the merger pursuant to which the Company became the parent of Shift Technologies, Inc. (now named Shift Platform, Inc.), and the Company s certificate of incorporation, as amended to give effect to the Charter Proposals and to change the Company s name to Shift Technologies, Inc., became effective. 
 
 The recent ruling by the Delaware Court of Chancery in the Boxed case introduced uncertainty as to whether Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL would have required the Share Increase Proposal to be approved by the vote of the majority of IAC s then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class. The Company had been operating with the understanding that the Charter Proposals were validly approved at the IAC Special Meeting. In light of this recent ruling, however, to resolve potential uncertainty with respect to the Company s share capital, the Company filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 205 of the DGCL to seek validation of the Charter Proposals. Section 205 of the DGCL permits the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, to ratify and validate potentially defective corporate acts. 
 
 On March 6, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the motion to expedite and set a hearing date for the Petition to be heard. On March 17, 2023, the hearing took place and the Court of Chancery approved the Company s request for relief. The Court of Chancery then entered an order under Section 205 of the DGCL on March 17, 2023, declaring (i) the increase in aggregate number of authorized shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001, of the Company from 50,000,000 to 500,000,000 under the Company s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and the Certificate of Incorporation, including the filing and effectiveness thereof, are validated and declared effective retroactive to the date of its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 13, 2020 and (2) all shares of capital stock of the Company issued in reliance on the effectiveness of the Certificate of Incorporation are validated and declared effective as of the date and time of the original issuance of such shares.

 Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 On May 11, 2022, the Company completed the Fair acquisition and issued an aggregate of 206,697 shares of Class A common stock. Such shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Equity and Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 11, 2022, the Sellers represented to the Company that they are accredited investors as that term is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act. Appropriate legends stating that such shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom were affixed to the certificates or book entry statements evidencing such shares. See Note 3 - Business Combinations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 On May 27, 2021, the Company completed a private offering of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes ). The aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold in the offering was million.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements about Shift s business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding Shift s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Shift s future results and financial condition may differ materially from those currently anticipated by Shift as a result of the factors described in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Throughout this section, unless otherwise noted we , us , our and the Company refer to Shift and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 Shift is a consumer-centric omnichannel retailer transforming the used car industry by leveraging its end-to-end ecommerce platform and retail locations to provide a technology-driven, hassle-free customer experience. 
 Launched in 2014, Shift started as a pure ecommerce seller and buyer of used cars, aimed at transforming the customer experience within the industry. Since inception, Shift has invested significantly into its technology platform to create an exceptional customer experience and to support and leverage the internal operations of the Company. 
 On October 13, 2020, Insurance Acquisition Corp. IAC ), an entity listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trade symbol INSU , acquired Shift Platform, Inc., formerly known as Shift Technologies, Inc. Legacy Shift ), by the merger of IAC Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of IAC, with and into Legacy Shift, with Legacy Shift continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of IAC (the IAC Merger ). The public company resulting from the merger was renamed Shift Technologies, Inc. 
 In August 2022, Shift announced both a strategic and operational restructuring and a merger with CarLotz (the "CarLotz Merger"), a consignment-to-retail used vehicle marketplace that operated a technology-enabled buying, sourcing, and selling model with an omnichannel experience. With the implementation of the restructuring and the close of the merger, Shift evolved into an omnichannel experience and established a plan to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing operating expenses and maximizing liquidity. 
 See Part I, Item 1 - "Business" for a detailed description and discussion of the Company's business. 
 Recent Events 
 Project Focus Restructuring Plan 
 On August 9, 2022, the Company announced the implementation of Project Focus, a restructuring plan designed to position the Company for long-term profitable growth by prioritizing unit economics, reducing our operating expenses and maximizing liquidity (the Restructuring Plan ). The primary elements of the Restructuring Plan are as follows: 
 Optimizing unit economics and GPU, by optimizing sales through Shift s most profitable online channel, and rebalancing inventory mix to favor Value vehicles, which Shift defines as older than 8 years or over 80,000 miles; 
 Consolidating Shift s physical operations to three West Coast markets in Los Angeles, Oakland, and Portland to efficiently support our new omnichannel fulfillment model, and closing seven existing locations; 
 Restructuring our workforce around our reduced physical footprint and more-efficient fulfillment model, eliminating approximately 650 positions or 60 of our workforce; and, 
 Undertaking additional efforts to reduce spending on overhead. 
 In connection with the implementation of the Restructuring Plan, we incurred expenses of approximately 29.6 million, consisting primarily of inventory liquidation, disposals of long-lived assets, and personnel costs including one-time termination benefits. The restructuring activities associated with the Restructuring Plan were substantially completed during the third quarter of 2022. Further personnel costs were incurred in the fourth quarter 2022 related to one-time termination benefits unrelated to the Restructuring Plan.

 CarLotz Merger 
 The Company closed its acquisition of CarLotz, Inc. in December 2022. At the date of this filing, the Company has closed all former CarLotz locations except those serving our current major markets in Los Angeles, Oakland, and Portland. The workforce of the combined company has also been reduced in accordance with our smaller geographic footprint and to eliminate redundancies arising the from the CarLotz Merger. 
 CEO Transition 
 On September 1, 2022, the Company announced that Jeffrey Clementz was appointed as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, succeeding George Arison, one of our co-founders, as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Arison will continue to serve in his capacity as a member of the Board. Mr. Clementz previously served as our President since September 2021. The Company has entered into an amended employment agreement with Mr. Clementz in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. 
 Nasdaq Deficiency Letter and Reverse Stock Split 
 On October 4, 2022, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our Class A common stock had closed below the 1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the "Bid Price Requirement").

 Business Description 
 Shift is an omnichannel retailer for buying and selling used cars, operating an end-to-end ecommerce platform and three stores located in California and Oregon. Each store provides vehicle inventory inspection, reconditioning and storage to prepare cars for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had 670.8 million in revenue, an increase of 5 compared to 636.9 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 The Company's plan to achieve long-term profitable growth prioritizes unit economics, operating expense reductions, and maximizing liquidity. Shift plans to increase market penetration in our urban, densely populated existing markets by using direct-to-consumer digital marketing and a responsive ecommerce sales approach 
 Shift's focus on improving unit economics is driven by direct vehicle acquisition channels, optimized inventory mix and ancillary product offerings, combined with streamlined inventory onboarding, controlled fulfillment costs, and centralized software. Shift s differentiated consumer sourcing strategy offers a wide variety of vehicles across the entire spectrum of model, price, age, and mileage to ensure that Shift has the right car for buyers regardless of interest, need, budget, or credit. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Shift sourced 95 of its inventory from consumer-sellers and partners driving improved margins and customer acquisition cost. Our data-driven vehicle evaluations help ensure acquisition of the right inventory at the right price to reduce days to sale. We believe that a differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers provides Shift with access to a deep pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory. Over time, we intend to expand our machine learning-enabled recommendation engine to better help customers find the cars best suited to them. 
 Shift offers a full suite of options to consumers to finance and protect their vehicle through our mobile point-of-sale solution or in our locations. These products include vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection, and tire coverage. 
 Since inception, Shift has invested significantly in its technology to provide a highly-rated customer experience, to support the operations of the business, and to allow the Company to scale over time. Our ecommerce platform has significant functionality that includes discover and search functionality for potential car buyers, the ability to connect customers to various lending partners for financing and service products, online prequalification form that filters inventory that meets their budget and financing requirements, ability to prequalify for financing, and the ability to get an instant online quote for car sellers. We will continue to develop our technology to improve the overall operations of the business and especially the customer experience.

 Revenue Model 
 Shift s two-sided model generates value from both the purchase and sale of vehicles along with financing and vehicle protection products. We acquire cars directly from consumers, partners, and other sources and sell vehicles to consumers at one of our markets, directly, through our ecommerce platform in a seamless end-to-end process, or through a combination of online and in-person. This model captures value from the difference in the price at which the car is acquired and sold, as well as through fees on the sale of ancillary products such as financing and vehicle protection products, also referred to as finance and insurance F I ), and services. If a car that we purchase does not meet our standards for retail sale, we generate revenue by selling through wholesale channels. These vehicles are primarily acquired from customers who trade-in their existing vehicles in connection with a purchase from us. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 670.8 million and 636.9 million, respectively. 
 Inventory Sourcing 
 We source the majority of our vehicles directly from consumers and partners who use the Shift platform to resell trade-in and other vehicles. These channels provide scarce and desirable local inventory of used cars of greater quality than those typically found at auction. In addition to those primary channels, we supplement our vehicle acquisitions with purchases from auto auctions, as well as some vehicles sourced locally through the trade-in program of an original equipment manufacturer OEM ). 
 Proprietary machine learning-enabled software inputs vast quantities of data across both the supply and demand sides to optimize our vehicle acquisition strategy. As we accumulate data, we expect to improve the performance of our model to optimize our vehicle selection and disposal. 
 Vehicle Reconditioning 
 All of the cars that Shift sells undergo a rigorous 150+ point mechanical inspection and reconditioning process in one of our markets (or at a third-party partner when additional capacity is needed) to help ensure that they are safe, reliable, up to cosmetic standards, and comfortable. We have created two classifications of inventory for reconditioning Value and Certified to optimize the level of reconditioning for each vehicle classification. This allows us to efficiently provide each customer with the greatest value through a tailored reconditioning approach. Value cars are typically sold at a lower price point and are sought after by consumers who have different expectations and tolerances for cosmetic reconditioning standards therefore, we focus on mechanical and safety issues for these vehicles, with less emphasis on cosmetic repair, in order to optimize reconditioning costs. This operational flexibility in our reconditioning process improves our ability to grow profitably and is a primary factor in our decision to conduct reconditioning in-house. 
 Financing and Vehicle Protection Products 
 We generate revenue by earning no obligation referral fees for selling ancillary products to customers that purchase vehicles through the Shift platform. Since we earn fees for the F I products we sell, our gross profit on these items is equal to the revenue we generate. Our current offering consists of financing from third-party lenders, guaranteed asset protection GAP ), vehicle protection plans and vehicle service contracts. We plan to offer additional third-party products to provide a wider product offering to customers and expect these products to contribute to reaching our revenue and profitability targets.

 Factors Affecting our Business Performance 
 Various trends and other factors have affected and may continue to affect our business, financial condition and operating results, including: 
 Deeper Market Penetration Within Our Existing Markets 
 We believe that there remains a substantial opportunity to capture additional market share within our existing service areas. We have proven our ability to command a strong market share through effective marketing channels, as demonstrated by our current market share in our most established cities. 
 Improvements in Technology Platform 
 We are constantly investing in our technology platform to improve both customer experience and our business performance. We regularly implement changes to our software to help customers find the right car for them, while the machine learning component of our inventory and pricing model ensures we get the right cars at the right price. As our algorithms evolve, we are able to better monetize our inventory of vehicles through improved pricing. Simultaneously, customers become more likely to purchase a car on our website, driving higher demand and sales volume. 
 Improvements in Reconditioning Processes 
 We learned early on from our experience in the used car sales business that in order to be a reliable used car resource with desirable inventory for all customer types, we needed to control our own reconditioning processes. Our reconditioning program has constantly improved over the course of our history, and we are happy with what we have achieved. Each unit of our inventory is reconditioned with a focus on safety first, while optimizing for repairs that will have the highest return on investment ROI ). 
 Growth in Other Revenue from Existing Revenue Streams 
 We have prioritized development of our other revenue streams, which comprise the financing and vehicle protection products as well as other ancillary products. We have invested in the technology and sales capabilities needed to increase the likelihood that consumers will purchase ancillary products in connection with the sale of a vehicle, and we see more opportunity for additional revenue within our existing channels from further expansion of our attach rates for our financing and vehicle protection product suite. 
 Growth in Other Revenue from Expansion of Product Offerings 
 We see great opportunity to further expand our other revenue streams through additional product offerings beyond the existing offerings on our platform. These incremental revenue streams will come in the form of on-boarding new lending partners to our existing loan program, as well as introducing entirely new financing and vehicle protection products to offer our customers. We intend to continue to grow this business segment to service every addressable need of our customers during the vehicle purchase process. 
 Seasonality 
 We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on, among other things, consumers car buying patterns. We have typically experienced higher revenue growth rates in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in each of the first or fourth quarters of the calendar year. We believe these results are due to seasonal buying patterns driven in part by the timing of income tax refunds, which we believe are an important source of car buyer down payments on used vehicle purchases. We recognize that in the future, our revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends (including any disruptions to normal seasonal trends arising from the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, and specifically the automotive retail industry.

 Key Operating Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our progress and make strategic decisions. Our key operating metrics measure the key drivers of our performance, increasing our brand awareness through unique site visitors and continuing to offer a full spectrum of used vehicles to service all types of customers. 
 Retail Units Sold 
 We define retail units sold as the number of vehicles sold to customers in a given period, net of returns. We currently have a seven-day, 200 mile return policy. The number of retail units sold is the primary driver of our revenues and, indirectly, gross profit, since retail unit sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams, including all financing and protection products. We view retail units sold as a key measure of our growth, as growth in this metric is an indicator of our ability to successfully scale our operations while maintaining product integrity and customer satisfaction. 
 Wholesale Units Sold 
 We define wholesale units sold as the number of vehicles sold through wholesale channels in a given period. While wholesale units are not the primary driver of revenue or gross profit, wholesale is a valuable channel as it allows us to be able to purchase vehicles regardless of condition, which is important for the purpose of accepting a trade-in from a customer making a vehicle purchase from us, and as an online destination for consumers to sell their cars even if not selling us a car that meets our retail standards. 
 Retail Average Sale Price 
 We define retail average sale price ASP as the average price paid by a customer for an retail vehicle, calculated as retail revenue divided by retail units. Retail average sale price helps us gauge market demand in real-time and allows us to maintain a range of inventory that most accurately reflects the overall price spectrum of used vehicle sales in the market. We believe this metric provides transparency and is comparable to our peers. 
 Wholesale Average Sale Price 
 We define wholesale average sale price as the average price paid by a customer for a wholesale vehicle, calculated as wholesale revenue divided by wholesale units. We believe this metric provides transparency and is comparable to our peers. 
 Gross Profit per Unit 
 We define gross profit per unit as the gross profit for retail, other, and wholesale, each of which divided by the total number of retail units sold in the period. We calculate gross profit as the revenue from vehicle sales and services less the costs associated with acquiring and reconditioning the vehicle prior to sale. Gross profit per unit is primarily driven by retail vehicle revenue, which generates additional revenue through attachment of our financing and protection products, and gross profit generated from wholesale vehicle sales. We present gross profit per unit from our three revenues streams as Retail gross profit per unit, Wholesale gross profit per unit and Other gross profit per unit. 
 Average Monthly Unique Visitors 
 We define a monthly unique visitor as an individual who has visited our website within a calendar month, based on data collected on our website. We calculate average monthly unique visitors as the sum of monthly unique visitors in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. To classify whether a visitor is unique , we dedupe (a technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data) each visitor based on email address and phone number, if available, and if not, we use the anonymous ID which lives in each user s internet cookies. This practice ensures that we do not double-count individuals who visit our website multiple times within any given month. We view average monthly unique visitors as a key indicator of the strength of our brand, the effectiveness of our advertising and merchandising campaigns and consumer awareness. 
 Average Days to Sale 
 We define average days to sale as the number of days between Shift s acquisition of a vehicle and sale of that vehicle to a customer, averaged across all retail units sold in a period. We view average days to sale as a useful metric in understanding the health of our inventory. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 Retail Vehicles Available for Sale 
 We define retail vehicles available for sale as the number of retail vehicles in inventory on the last day of a given reporting period. Until we reach an optimal pooled inventory level, we view retail vehicles available for sale as a key measure of our growth. Growth in retail vehicles available for sale increases the selection of vehicles available to consumers, which we believe will allow us to increase the number of vehicles we sell. Moreover, growth in retail vehicles available for sale is an indicator of our ability to scale our vehicle purchasing, inspection and reconditioning operations.

We present operating results down to gross profit from three distinct revenue channels: 
 Retail Vehicles, Net : The retail channel within our Retail segment represents sales of used vehicles directly to our customers through our website. 
 Other, Net : The other channel within our Retail segment represents fees earned on sales of value-added products associated with the sale of retail vehicles. 
 Wholesale Vehicles : The Wholesale channel is the only component of our Wholesale segment and represents sales of used vehicles through wholesale auctions. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 
 Retail Vehicle Revenue, Net 
 Retail vehicle revenue increased by 17.1 million, or 3.2 , to 555.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 538.4 million in the comparable period in 2021. The increase in retail vehicle revenue was partly due to an increase in retail ASP, which was 26,503 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 23,155 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase in retail ASP was primarily a reflection of increased demand for used vehicles coupled with lower-than-average inventory levels across the auto market as a whole as compared to the prior period. 
 This increase was partly offset by a decrease in retail unit sales, as we sold 20,961 retail vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 23,251 retail vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in unit sales was driven by the execution of the Restructuring Plan in the second half of 2022. Unit sales decreased due to the closure of inventory storage and reconditioning centers in California, Washington, and Texas and the associated reduction in inventory available for sale. 
 Following the Restructuring Plan, retail revenue and unit sales are expected to trend downwards in 2023 as the Company's smaller geographic footprint results in reduced unit volume, focusing on profitability over top-line growth. 
 Other Revenue, Net 
 Other revenue increased by 4.4 million, or 19.3 , to 27.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 22.6 million in the comparable period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to strategic investments to enhance and expand our ancillary product offerings to better monetize our unit sales. 
 Wholesale Vehicle Revenue 
 Wholesale vehicle revenue increased by 12.4 million, or 16.3 , to 88.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 75.8 million in the comparable period in 2021. This increase in wholesale vehicle revenue was primarily due to a 53.8 increase in ASP resulting from the fact that the Company liquidated a relatively high proportion of higher priced inventory as part of the Restructuring Plan that would ordinarily have been sold through the Retail channel. The increase in ASP was partly offset by a decrease in wholesale unit volume as we sold 5,344 wholesale vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 7,067 wholesale vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales increased by 57.3 million, or 9.8 , to 645.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 588.1 million in the comparable period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased buying and selling prices in the used auto market as a whole, caused by constrained supplies of new and used vehicles. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in unit sales as we sold 26,305 total vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 30,318 total vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Retail Vehicle Gross Profit 
 Retail vehicle gross profit decreased by 16.7 million, or 66.0 , to 8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 25.3 million in the comparable period in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in retail gross profit per unit, which shrank to 409 per unit for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,087 per unit in the comparable period in 2021. The decrease in retail vehicle gross profit was partly due to a decrease in retail units sold, as described in Retail Vehicle Revenue, Net above. The decrease in retail gross profit per unit was largely driven by atypical vehicle appreciation witnessed in the comparable period of 2021, as well as promotional discounts offered in 2022 to liquidate inventory as part of the Restructuring Plan. Retail vehicle gross profit is expected to improve through a more balanced sales mix of older and newer vehicles as well as through the return of normal depreciation and seasonality cycles. 
 Other Gross Profit 
 Other gross profit increased by 4.4 million, or 19.3 , to 27.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 22.6 million in the comparable period in 2021. The increase in other gross profit was partly due to the increase in other gross profit per unit to 1,288 during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 973 per unit in the comparable period in 2021. Other revenue consists of 100 gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue. Therefore, changes in other gross profit and the associated drivers are identical to changes in other revenue and the associated drivers. 
 Wholesale Vehicle Gross Loss 
 Wholesale vehicle gross loss increased by 11.1 million, or 1,249.9 , to 10.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from a profit of 0.9 million in the comparable period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increase in wholesale gross loss per unit, which grew to 489 per unit for the year ended December 31, 2022, from a profit of 38 in the comparable period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the liquidation of vehicles through the Wholesale channel as we adjust to a smaller geographic footprint pursuant to the Restructuring Plan.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 6.0 million, or 2.7 , to 214.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 220.1 million in the comparable period in 2021. The decrease was partly due to the decrease in compensation costs of 9.6 million, driven by the decrease in average headcount to 970 from 1,037. The decrease was also partly due to a decrease in marketing expense of 17.3 million, which resulted from abnormally high marketing spend in the comparable period caused by overlapping marketing campaigns, as well as curtailed marketing spend in the second half of 2022. Lastly, other costs increased by 20.8 million due primarily to transaction costs incurred for the merger with CarLotz, Inc. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from 34.6 to 31.9 as the Company began to realize cost savings from the Restructuring Plan and various other efforts to improve overhead efficiency.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of liquidity 
 Our main source of liquidity is cash generated from financing activities. Cash generated from financing activities through December 31, 2022 primarily includes proceeds from the IAC Merger and PIPE financing completed in October 2020, issuance of convertible notes and senior unsecured notes, and proceeds from the Flooring Line of Credit facility with Ally (the "Ally FLOC"). Refer to Note 10 - Borrowings and Note 15 - Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, we obtained 95.7 million in cash from the CarLotz Merger (see Note 3 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 On May 27, 2021, the Company completed a private offering of its 4.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes ). The aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold in the offering was 150.0 million. The Notes accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 4.75 per year. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by the Company. See Note 10 - Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Notes. The Company used approximately 28.4 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay the cost of the Capped Call Transactions (see Note 12 - Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ), and is using the remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 On May 11, 2022, in conjunction with the acquisition of Fair (See Note 3 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ), the Company entered into an agreement with SB LL Holdco, Inc. ("SB LL Holdco") to a sale of 20.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 Senior Unsecured Notes due May 11, 2025 ("Senior Unsecured Notes"). 
 Since inception, the Company has generated recurring losses which has resulted in an accumulated deficit of 612.8 million as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had negative operating cash flows of 110.4 million. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors.

 Liquidity and Management's Plan 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated negative cash flows from operations of approximately 110.4 million and 211.0 million, respectively, and generated net losses of approximately 172.0 million and 166.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 96.2 million and total working capital of 83.1 million. Since inception, the Company has had negative cash flows and losses from operations which it has funded primarily through issuances of common and preferred stock and through a reverse recapitalization via the IAC Merger in October 2020. The Company has historically funded vehicle inventory purchases through its vehicle floorplan facilities (see Note 10 - Borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Company's current floorplan facility expires on December 9, 2023. The Company also continually assesses other opportunities to raise debt or equity capital. 
 The Company's plan is to raise capital to provide the liquidity necessary to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months, and to secure a new or amended floorplan financing arrangement to provide continuity when the current floorplan expires. The Company's ability to raise capital may be constrained by the price of and demand for the Company's Class A common stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or obtain financing that will provide it with sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months. 
 The Company continues to implement the Restructuring Plan which is designed to improve the Company s liquidity by improving unit economics and reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Restructuring Plan seeks to achieve these goals by eliminating less profitable fulfillment channels, consolidating operations into fewer physical locations, and reducing headcount accordingly. Please see Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued or available to be issued. Management determined as a result of this evaluation, the Company s losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, combined with its current cash, working capital position, and expiration of the current floorplan financing arrangement on December 9, 2023, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 in thousands) Cash Flow Data: Net cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash used in operating activities (110,416) (211,046) Net cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash provided by (used in) investing activities 65,995 (14,143) Net cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash provided by (used in) financing activities (42,074) 183,989 
 Operating Activities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 110.4 million, a decrease of 100.6 million from cash used in operating activities of 211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by net sales of inventory of 162.1 million, offset by an increase of 50.1 million in net cash used to settle accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net provided by investing activities of 66.0 million was primarily driven by the 95.7 million of cash acquired as part of the acquisition of CarLotz, Inc., offset by 15.0 million used to purchase Fair Dealer Services, LLC (See Note 3 - Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as capitalization of website and internal-use software costs and purchases of capital equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 42.1 million, primarily due to net repayments on the Flooring Line of Credit of 58.4 million, offset by proceeds from the Senior Unsecured Notes of 19.6 million (See Note 10 - Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ). 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company reported a liability for vehicles acquired under an OEM program of zero and 3.6 million, respectively. The Company records inventory received under the arrangement with the OEM equal to the amount of the liability due to the OEM to acquire such vehicles. The liability due to the OEM provider for such acquired vehicles is equal to the OEM s original acquisition price. 
 The Company has various operating leases of real estate and equipment. See Note 6 - Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature and timing of cash obligations due under these leases. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are a party to an off-balance sheet arrangement, as the Company guaranteed the lease obligation of two closed locations assigned to a third-party (see Note 6 - Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information). We are not a party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or otherwise complex. Based on these criteria, management has identified the following critical accounting policies: 
 Revenue 
 We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Control passes to the customer at the time of delivery or pick-up. We may collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale as required. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in revenues or cost of sales. 
 We have determined that a portion of the value associated with warrant consideration paid to Lithia, as a customer of Shift, should be treated as contra-revenue. 
 We recognize revenue at a point in time as described below. 
 Retail Vehicle Revenue 
 We sell used vehicles to retail customers through our ecommerce platform. The price for used vehicles is the stand-alone selling price as set forth in the customer contract. Customers frequently trade-in their existing vehicle to apply toward the price of a used vehicle, which is included in the transaction price as non-cash consideration at the stated trade-in value within the contract. We satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue for sales of retail vehicles at a point in time when the vehicles are delivered to or picked up by the customer. The revenue recognized by Shift is the amount equal to the stand-alone selling price, including any service fees, less any discounts and an estimate for returns. Revenue excludes any sales taxes, title and registration fees, and other government fees that are collected from customers. 
 We receive payment for vehicle sales directly from the customer at the time of sale or, if the customer uses financing, from third-party financial institutions within a short period of time following the sale. Any payments received prior to the delivery or pick-up of used vehicles are recorded as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until delivery or pick-up occurs. 
 Our return policy allows customers to initiate a return during the first seven days or 200 miles after delivery (whichever comes first). Retail vehicle revenue is recognized net of a reserve for returns, which is estimated using historical experience and trends. The returns reserve was 0.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 1.0 million at December 31, 2021, and is materially offset by matching reductions in cost of sales. 
 Other Revenue 
 We provide buyers on our platform with options for financing and vehicle protection products. All such services are provided by unrelated third-party vendors, with whom we have agreements giving us the right to offer such services on its platform. When a buyer selects a service from these providers, we earn a commission based on the actual price paid or financed, respectively. We concluded that we are an agent for these transactions because we do not control the products before they are transferred to the customer and our risk related to these products is limited to the commissions that we receive. Accordingly, we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale. 
 In the event that a customer cancels certain finance and insurance products, the Company may be obligated to return all or part of its commission. Other revenue is recognized net of a reserve for cancellations, which is estimated using historical experience and trends. The reserve for estimated cancellations at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2.7 million and 2.3 million, respectively, and is presented in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Wholesale Vehicle Revenue 
 We also sell vehicles through wholesale auctions. These vehicles sold to wholesalers are primarily acquired from customers who trade-in their existing vehicles and such vehicles do not meet our quality standards to list and sell through our website. We satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue for wholesale vehicle revenue at a point in time when the vehicle is sold at auction or directly to a wholesaler. The transaction price is typically due and collected within one week of the date of the sale. 
 Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract 
 We elected, as a practical expedient, to expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been less than one year. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Valuation of Inventory 
 Inventory consists of used vehicles, primarily acquired through auction and individual sellers, as well as some vehicles sourced locally through the trade-in program of an OEM. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Acquisition costs and vehicle reconditioning costs, including parts, applied labor, unapplied labor, inbound transportation costs and other incremental costs, are allocated to inventory via specific identification and standard costing, which approximate average costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete, dispose and transport the vehicles. Estimated selling price is derived from historical data and trends, such as sales price and average days to sell similar vehicles, along with independent market resources. To the extent that there are significant changes to estimated vehicle selling prices or decreases in demand for used vehicles, there could be significant adjustments to reflect our inventory at net realizable value. 
 Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
 In evaluating the ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event that we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period when such determination is made. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. 
 Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for income tax. 
 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 We classify stock-based awards granted in exchange for services as either equity awards or as liability awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards to employees and non-employees are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The calculation of the stock-based compensation expense for stock options is based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires significant estimates including the expected volatility of our common stock, expected dividend yield, option term and risk-free rate. The fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We elect to account for forfeitures as they occur by reversing compensation cost if the award is forfeited.

 Determination of the Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Escrow Shares 
 The former Legacy Shift stockholders were entitled to receive up to an additional 600,021 shares of the Company s common stock (the Escrow Shares ). The Escrow Shares were issued to a third-party escrow agent in connection with the closing of the IAC Merger, with each former Legacy Shift stockholder listed as beneficiary in proportion to their percentage ownership of Legacy Shift common shares immediately prior to the IAC Merger. The Escrow Shares will be released to the beneficiaries if the price of our common stock meets certain thresholds in the 30 months following the closing of the IAC Merger (see Note 3 - Merger in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information). The Escrow shares will be returned to the Company if these thresholds are not reached. On October 13, 2021, 50 of the Escrow Shares were returned to the Company as our common stock did not meet the required threshold for release of the first tranche. 
 The Escrow Shares meet the accounting definition of a derivative financial instrument. Prior to October 13, 2021, as the number of Escrow Shares that would ultimately be released was partially dependent on variables (namely, the occurrence of a change in control) that were not valuation inputs to a fixed for fixed option or forward contract, the Escrow Shares were not considered to be indexed to the Company s common stock and were therefore classified as a liability. The Company s obligation to release the Escrow Shares upon achievement of the milestones was recorded to financial instruments liability on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as of the date of the IAC Merger, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in change in fair value of financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Following the return of the first tranche of the Escrow Shares to the Company on October 13, 2021, the Escrow Shares met the "fixed for fixed" option or forward contract criteria for equity classification. As such, changes in fair value of the Escrow Shares prior to October 13, 2021 were recorded in change in fair value of financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the shares on October 13, 2021 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital from financial instruments liability on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 The fair value of the Escrow Shares was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which requires significant estimates including the expected volatility of our common stock. 
 Convertible Notes 
 On May 27, 2021, the Company completed a private offering of its 4.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes ). The aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold in the offering was 150.0 million. The Notes accrue interest, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021, at a rate of 4.75 per year. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by the Company. Please see Note 7 - Borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 The Notes contain conversion and redemption features that were evaluated for separate accounting as bifurcated embedded derivatives under applicable GAAP. The conversion feature was determined to meet the scope exception for embedded features indexed to the Company's common stock, and therefore was not accounted for separately from the host debt instrument. The redemption feature was determined to meet the scope exception for embedded features that are clearly and closely related to the host instrument, and therefore was not accounted for separately from the host debt instrument. The Notes are presented on the consolidated balance sheets at par value, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs.

Table of Contents 

 Capped Call Transactions 
 On May 27, 2021, in connection with the issuance of the Notes (see Note 7 - Borrowings), the Company consummated privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain of the initial purchasers, their respective affiliates and other counterparties (the "Capped Call Counterparties"). The Capped Call Transactions initially cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of the Company s Class A common shares underlying the Notes. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to holders of the Company s Class A common stock upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that the Company could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Notes upon conversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Call Transactions are settled from time to time upon the conversion of the Notes, with a final expiration date of May 15, 2026. The Capped Call Transactions are settled in the same proportion of cash and stock as the converted Notes. The proportion of cash and stock used to settle the Notes is at the discretion of the Company. 
 The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the Capped Call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not change any holder s rights under the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. 
 The Company used approximately 28.4 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to pay the cost of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Company's stock. The premiums paid for the Capped Call Transactions have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires all assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The determination of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and assumptions, such as, if applicable, forecasted revenue growth rates and operating cash flows, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates of developed technology, and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Depending on the nature of the acquired assets, we use either the income approach or the cost to recreate approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets. Under the cost to recreate approach, the company estimates the cost to re-create an equivalent asset based on estimated labor hours, labor cost, other costs as applicable, and appropriate profit margins. Under the income approach, the Company estimates future cash flows and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the Company s relative risk. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation we include consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Evaluating long-lived assets for impairment or abandonment requires the use of estimates. To assess the recoverability of definite-lived assets, we estimate the remaining undiscounted cash flows pertaining to each asset group. For any asset groups that are not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, we estimate the fair value of the asset group and compare it to the carrying value of the assets. Any excess of carrying value over fair value is expensed as an impairment charge. Because of the magnitude of the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets, modest changes in our estimates could have a material impact on the reported result and financial condition of the Company. The facility closures and the drop in our stock market capitalization were triggering events in the current period. A detailed discussion of estimates pertaining to the current period impairment assessment is included in Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Goodwill 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment loss of 0.5 million, which is included in loss on impairment on the consolidated statements of operations. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022, management determined that indicators of impairment existed and performed a goodwill impairment test. The facility closures and the drop in our stock price were indicators of impairment in the current period. Management engaged third party valuation consultants to determine the fair value of the Retail segment (which also meets the definition of a reporting unit for goodwill impairment purposes). The fair value was determined using a market approach based on comparison to peer company valuation multiples.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Shift Technologies, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Shift Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, since inception, the Company has suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, combined with its current cash and working capital position, and expiration of the current floorplan financing arrangement on December 9, 2023, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases effective January 1, 2022, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases . 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 The Company s return policy allows customers to initiate a return during the first or miles after delivery (whichever comes first). Retail vehicle revenue is recognized net of a reserve for returns, which is estimated using historical experience and trends. The reserve for estimated returns is presented gross on the consolidated balance sheets, with an asset recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a refund liability recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The net impact of the returns reserve is immaterial. 
 Other Revenue 
 The Company provides buyers on its platform with options for financing, insurance, and extended warranties, as well as other value-added products such as vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection and wheel and tire coverage. All such services are provided by unrelated third-party vendors and the Company has agreements with each of these vendors giving the Company the right to offer such services on its platform. 
 When a buyer selects a service from these providers, the Company earns a commission based on the actual price paid or financed. The Company concluded that it is an agent for these transactions because it does not control the products before they are transferred to the customer. Accordingly, the Company recognizes commission revenue at the time of sale. 
 In the event that a customer prematurely cancels certain finance and insurance products, the Company may be obligated to return all or part of its commission. Other revenue is recognized net of a reserve for cancellations, which is estimated using historical experience and trends. The reserve for estimated cancellations at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was million and million, respectively, and is presented in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Liquidity and Management's Plan 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated negative cash flows from operations of approximately million and million, respectively, and generated net losses of approximately million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and total working capital of million. Since inception, the Company has had negative cash flows and losses from operations which it has funded primarily through issuances of common and preferred stock and through a reverse recapitalization via the IAC Merger in October 2020. The Company has historically funded vehicle inventory purchases through its vehicle floorplan facilities (see Note 10 - Borrowings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Company's current floorplan facility expires on December 9, 2023. The Company also continually assesses other opportunities to raise debt or equity capital. 
 The Company's plan is to raise capital to provide the liquidity necessary to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months, and to secure a new or amended floorplan financing arrangement to provide continuity when the current floorplan expires. The Company's ability to raise capital may be constrained by the price of and demand for the Company's Class A common stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or obtain financing that will provide it with sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months. 
 The Company continues to implement the Restructuring Plan which is designed to improve the Company s liquidity by improving unit economics and reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Restructuring Plan seeks to achieve these goals by eliminating less profitable fulfillment channels, consolidating operations into fewer physical locations, and reducing headcount accordingly. Please see Note 16 - Impairment and Restructuring to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued or available to be issued. Management determined as a result of this evaluation, the Company s losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, combined with its current cash, working capital position, and expiration of the current floorplan financing arrangement on December 9, 2023, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Identifiable Intangible Assets 
 The fair value of the trademarks and developed technology intangible assets has been determined using the relief-from-royalty method, which involves the estimation of an amount of hypothetical royalty savings enjoyed by the entity that owns the intangible asset because that entity is relieved from having to license that intangible asset from another owner. In using this method, third-party arm s-length royalty or license agreements were analyzed. The licensing transactions were selected as reflecting similar risks and characteristics that make them comparable to the subject assets. The net revenue expected to be generated by the intangible asset during its expected remaining life was then multiplied by the selected royalty rate. The selected estimated royalty rates for the trademarks and developed technology were and , respectively. The estimated after tax royalty streams were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of , to estimate the fair value of the subject intangible assets. 
 The trademarks are included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

 CarLotz stockholder matters 
 On November 4, 2022, a lawsuit entitled Derek Dorrien v. CarLotz, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09463, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against CarLotz and the members of the CarLotz board of directors (the Dorrien Action ). On November 4, 2022, a lawsuit entitled Sholom D. Keller v. CarLotz, Inc. et al., Case No. 2022-1006-NAC, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against CarLotz and the members of the CarLotz board of directors (the Keller Action and together with the Dorrien Action, the Actions ). The Dorrien Action alleges that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by, among other things, omitting certain allegedly material information with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Transactions in the registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 26, 2022. The Keller Action alleges that the members of the CarLotz board of directors and Lev Peker, in his capacity as an officer of CarLotz, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Transactions. The Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief, money damages and the costs of the Actions, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees. Shift is not named as a defendant in the Actions. We believe that the plaintiffs allegations in the Actions are without merit; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that CarLotz s or our defense of the action will be successful. 
 In addition, on October 3, 2022, a purported stockholder of CarLotz sent a demand to CarLotz and us regarding the Registration Statement (the CarLotz Stockholder Demand ). The CarLotz Stockholder Demand alleges the Registration Statement omits material information with respect to the Transactions and demands that CarLotz, the CarLotz board of directors, and Shift provide corrective disclosures. Shift disagrees with and intends to vigorously defend against any claim, if asserted, arising from the CarLotz Stockholder Demand. 
 Delaware Section 205 Petition 
 On March 6, 2023, Shift filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL to resolve potential uncertainty with respect to the Company s share capital. Such uncertainty was introduced by a recent decision in Garfield v. Boxed, Inc., 2022 WL 17959766 (Del. Ch. Dec. 27, 2022) that potentially affects the Company and many other similarly situated companies that were formed and became publicly traded as a special purpose acquisition company SPAC ). Out of an abundance of caution, the Company elected to pursue the remedial actions described below. Concurrently with the filing of the Petition, the Company filed a motion to expedite the hearing on the Petition, which was subsequently granted on March 6, 2023.

 to (such proposal, the Share Increase Proposal and, together with such other amendments to the SPAC Charter, the Charter Proposals ). At the IAC Special Meeting, the Charter Proposals were approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock of IAC as of the record date for the IAC Special Meeting, voting together as a single class. After the IAC Special Meeting, IAC and Shift Technologies, Inc. closed the merger pursuant to which the Company became the parent of Shift Technologies, Inc. (now named Shift Platform, Inc.), and the Company s certificate of incorporation, as amended to give effect to the Charter Proposals and to change the Company s name to Shift Technologies, Inc., became effective. 
 The recent ruling by the Delaware Court of Chancery in the Boxed case introduced uncertainty as to whether Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL would have required the Share Increase Proposal to be approved by the vote of the majority of IAC s then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class. The Company had been operating with the understanding that the Charter Proposals were validly approved at the IAC Special Meeting. In light of this recent ruling, however, to resolve potential uncertainty with respect to the Company s share capital, the Company filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 205 of the DGCL to seek validation of the Charter Proposals. Section 205 of the DGCL permits the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, to ratify and validate potentially defective corporate acts. 
 On March 6, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the motion to expedite and set a hearing date for the Petition to be heard. On March 17, 2023, the hearing took place and the Court of Chancery approved the Company s request for relief. The Court of Chancery then entered an order under Section 205 of the DGCL on March 17, 2023, declaring (i) the increase in aggregate number of authorized shares of Class A common stock, par value , of the Company from to under the Company s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and the Certificate of Incorporation, including the filing and effectiveness thereof, are validated and declared effective retroactive to the date of its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 13, 2020 and (2) all shares of capital stock of the Company issued in reliance on the effectiveness of the Certificate of Incorporation are validated and declared effective as of the date and time of the original issuance of such shares.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 1. Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (the "Disclosure Controls") within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Our Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our Disclosure Controls, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls, which was done under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on the evaluation of our Disclosure Controls, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our Disclosure Controls were not effective due to material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as disclosed below. 
 2. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that evaluation, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management excluded CarLotz Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired in a business combination on December 9, 2022. Total assets and total revenue that were excluded from management's assessment represented approximately 46 and less than 1 , respectively, of consolidated total assets and total revenue, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The first material weakness relates to lack of a process to demonstrate commitment to attracting, developing, and retaining competent individuals in alignment with objectives. This material weakness impacted the effectiveness of our control environment and our entity level controls. It resulted in the Company not maintaining a complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with its financial reporting requirements and the complexity of the Company s operations and transactions. The second material weakness relates to insufficient selection and development of Information Technology General Controls ("ITGCs") to support the achievement of objectives. 
 These material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that may not be detected. 
 107 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements or prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act and our status as a non-accelerated filer. 
 3. Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses 
 The Company is devoting significant time, attention, and resources to remediating the above material weaknesses. The Company has executed or continues to execute the following steps intended to remediate the material weaknesses described above and strengthen our internal control: 
 The Company hired experienced finance and accounting executives in the positions of Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Corporate Controller, Director of SEC Reporting, and Director of Information Technology. 
 The Company continues to train and develop experienced accounting personnel with a level of accounting knowledge and experience in the application of US GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and the complexity of our operations and transactions. 
 The Company has engaged external specialists as needed to provide assistance in accounting for significant, non-routine or complex transactions. 
 The Company engaged external consultants to assist the Company in designing, implementing, and monitoring an appropriate system of internal control, including ITGCs. 
 The Company is executing several initiatives to strengthen our ITGC environment, including but not limited to: 
 Implementing additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls and monitoring activities related to automated processes and systems and ITGCs related to financial reporting; 
 Implementing improved IT policies, procedures and control activities for key systems which impact our financial reporting; and, 
 Dedicating an appropriate amount of resources to monitoring ITGCs related to financial reporting, including a sufficient complement of personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training to ensure compliance with policies and procedures. 
 The Company has made significant progress in addressing the previously identified material weaknesses, and the results of management s testing indicate that the Company s control environment has improved since the material weaknesses were first identified. However, remediation efforts in the second half of 2022 were negatively impacted by factors including employee turnover in relevant roles and changes in business processes resulting from restructuring activities, as well as the business acquisitions completed during the period. As a result, management was unable to conclude that the material weaknesses were fully remediated as of December 31, 2022. The material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until we have concluded, through testing, that applicable controls have been designed and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 108 

We plan to continue to devote significant time and attention to remediate the above material weaknesses as soon as reasonably practicable. As we continue to evaluate our controls, we will make the changes described above as well as any others determined to be needed to enhance our control environment and remediate the material weaknesses. We believe these actions will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting; however, there can be no guarantee that such remediation will be sufficient. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate. 
 4. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 Overview 
 We provide our executives with an annual base salary as a fixed, stable form of compensation, and we grant our executives equity-based compensation to provide an additional incentive to grow our business and further link the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. In addition, we provided certain cash incentive opportunities to our executives for fiscal year 2022 (as described below) to incentivize the executives to achieve specified financial and operating objectives we believed would help create long-term value for our stockholders. Certain executives also received retention bonuses in recognition of their value to the Company in meeting its financial and strategic business objectives. We have also entered into agreements with our executives that provide for severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment. 
 The Leadership Development, Compensation and Governance Committee reviews our executive officers overall compensation packages on an annual basis (or more frequently as it deems warranted) to help ensure we continue to attract and retain highly talented executives and provide appropriate incentives to continue to grow our company. 
 We have opted to comply with the executive compensation rules applicable to "emerging growth companies" and smaller reporting companies, as such terms are defined under the Securities Act, which require compensation disclosure for the Company s principal executive officer and the next two most highly compensated executive officers.

Severance Plan for Key Management Employees

Participating executives are eligible to receive severance benefits if their employment is terminated for cause or without good reason (each as defined in the Severance Plan) and they enter into a release agreement with the Company within 60 days of such termination. Specific severance benefits are dependent on each executive s position and whether their termination occurs upon or within one year of a change in control (as defined in the Shift Technologies, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended (the Equity Plan )). Generally, following a qualifying termination, an executive will be eligible to receive certain cash severance and the option to receive certain continuing health insurance coverage under COBRA. If such termination occurs upon or within one year of a change in control, an executive will also be eligible to receive: (i) a payment equal to the executive s prorated annual bonus, (ii) vesting of all or a portion of the outstanding unvested equity awards held by the executive under the Equity Plan, and (iii) to the extent applicable to the executive, a payment equal to a prorated portion of any unpaid retention payment payable under a written retention agreement then in place between the executive and the Company. Severance benefits payable under the Severance Plan are not intended to be duplicative of other separation payments or benefits that may be payable to an executive under another agreement or arrangement with the Company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, under any executive employment agreement.

Item 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 Review of Related Party Transactions 
 Pursuant to the charter of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee reviews with both management and the independent auditors and approves any related party transactions or dealing between parties related to the Company. In accordance with this policy, the Audit Committee reviews and considers for approval any transactions in which (i) Shift or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds 120,000 and (iii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all employees of the Company generally. In assessing a related party transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion. 
 For purposes of this policy, related person and transaction have the meanings contained in Item 404 of Regulation S-K. The individuals and entities that are considered related persons include: 
 Directors, nominees for director and executive officers of Shift; 
 Any person known to be the beneficial owner of five percent or more of our common stock (a 5 Stockholder and 
 Any immediate family member, as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, of a director, nominee for director, executive officer or 5 Stockholder. 
 Any related person transaction will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Sales with Related Party 
 The Company operated a one-sided marketplace OSM program whereby the Company acquired cars from various sources in Oxnard, California and sold them directly and solely to Lithia. The Company invoiced Lithia based on the purchase price of the car plus an agreed upon margin. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized approximately 4.7 million and 16.8 million, respectively, of sales from the OSM agreement with Lithia. The OSM program was terminated in the second quarter of 2022 with the last sale to Lithia taking place in March 2022. 
 During the period from the execution of the Merger Agreement with CarLotz on August 9, 2022 until the merger closing on December 9, 2022, the Company sold vehicles totaling 3.0 million to CarLotz, included in retail revenue, net on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Accounts Receivable from Related Party 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 2.1 million in outstanding accounts receivable from Lithia, which is comprised 2.0 million in vehicle sales and 77 thousand, respectively, in commissions based on the number of loan contracts booked with US bank. There were no receivables due from Lithia at December 31, 2022. 
 In September 2018, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement and a commercial agreement for Milestone 1 with Lithia and granted Lithia a warrant to purchase 8,666,154 shares of Legacy Shift common stock at an exercise price of 0.10 per share (the Warrant Shares ). The Warrant Shares were scheduled to vest and become exercisable in six separate tranches of 1,444,359 shares each. Vesting and exercisability was dependent upon the achievement of the Milestones, as defined below. While the Warrant Agreement establishes general vesting terms for each of the six Milestones, each of the six Milestones contains substantive service or performance requirements, and were non-binding as neither the Company nor Lithia were obligated to perform until the commercial agreement associated with each Milestone was executed. All Warrant Shares became vested prior to the Vesting Termination Date and were exercised prior to the IAC Merger. 
 134 

In connection with the negotiations related to Milestone 5, Lithia facilitated an agreement with Automotive Warranty Services AWS to sell and market AWS s service plans, whereby the Company receives commission rates from AWS of comparable terms to those received by Lithia. In substance the Company paid Lithia, in the form of Warrant Shares, to make an upfront payment to Company s customers on behalf of the Company as the Company achieved favorable pricing from AWS. The benefits of this agreement were guaranteed by Lithia for an initial term of five years commencing on the signing date of the agreement. Such arrangement was the first of a number of agreements to be entered into under the terms of Milestone 5, see further discussion below. The estimated fair value of the in substance upfront payment to AWS was 2.8 million with an offsetting entry recorded to additional paid-in capital, representing a capital transaction with a related party. 
 Milestone 5 was met in October 2019 and the Company recorded the warrants to additional paid-in capital based on a fair value of 4.3 million. Milestone 5 was achieved after a mutual signed agreement was entered into evidencing that Lithia provided commercially best efforts to help the Company secure and maintain access to four finance and insurance products on par with a typical Lithia store. The fair value of the in substance upfront payment, other than the 2.8 million for AWS discussed above, was 0.4 million and was recorded to other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The combined asset recorded of 3.2 million is subject to amortization over a five-year period expected period of benefit. During year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company amortized 0.6 million and 0.6 million, respectively of the asset as a reduction to finance and insurance sales, which is recorded within other revenue, net on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the remaining asset, net of amortization, was 0.6 million and 1.2 million, respectively. 
 Lease Agreements 
 On November 1, 2018 and July 10, 2019, pursuant to Milestone 3 and 4, the Company and Lithia, entered into license and services agreements that govern the Company s access to and utilization of reconditioning, offices and parking spaces at the Concord and Portland facilities of Lithia, respectively. Both agreements expired on October 12, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, total costs related to these agreements were 0.1 million. The lease costs were expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Flooring Line of Credit Guarantee 
 In February 2019, the Company entered into a guarantee agreement with Lithia. The interest rate was 1.50 per annum based on a daily outstanding flooring line of credit and was payable monthly to Lithia. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded 78 thousand of interest and 2.1 million of deferred borrowing cost amortization to interest and other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The guarantee expired coterminously with the FLOC on October 11, 2021. 
 Accounts Payable Due to Related Party 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 payables and accruals to Lithia consisted of other miscellaneous expenses of 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively. 
 Director Independence 
 As a result of our common stock being listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq ), Shift adheres to the rules of such exchange in determining whether a director is independent. Nasdaq listing rules require that a majority of the board of directors of a company listed on Nasdaq be composed of independent directors, which is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
 Our Board of Directors has undertaken a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board of Directors has determined that none of Victoria McInnis, Kellyn Smith Kenny, Adam Nash, Kimberly Sheehy, Luis Solorzano and James Skinner has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors qualifies as an independent director under the Nasdaq listing rules. In making these determinations, our Board of Directors considered any current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with the Company and all other facts and circumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining independence, including the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each non-employee director.
