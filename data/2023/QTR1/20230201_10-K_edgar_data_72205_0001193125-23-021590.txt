Item 1. 
 Business Nobility Homes, Inc., a Florida corporation incorporated in 1967, designs, manufactures and sells a broad line of manufactured and modular homes through its own retail sales centers throughout Florida. Nobility also sells its manufactured homes on a wholesale basis to independent manufactured home retail dealers and manufactured home communities. All references in this annual report on Form 10-K to Nobility, Company, we, us, or our refer to Nobility Homes, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise suggests. Manufactured Homes Nobility s homes are available in approximately 100 active models sold under the trade names Kingswood, Richwood, Tropic Isle, Regency Manor, and Tropic Manor. The homes, ranging in size from 464 to 2,800 square feet and containing from one to five bedrooms, are available in: 

Single-wide widths of 14 and 16 feet ranging from 35 to 72 feet in length. 

Double-wide widths of 20, 24, 26, 28 and 32 feet ranging from 32 to 72 feet in length. 

Triple-wide widths of 42 feet ranging from 60 to 72 feet in length. 

Quad unit with 2 sections 28 feet wide from 40 to 48 feet long and 2 sections 28 feet wide by 52 feet long. Our floor plans can be built as an on-frame modular home. We have been approved to build A.N.S.I. (American National Standards Institute) Park models less than 400 square feet and exposure D homes. Nobility s homes are sold primarily as unfurnished dwellings ready for permanent occupancy. Interiors are designed and color coordinated in a range of decors. Depending on the size of the unit and quality of appliances and other appointments, retail prices for Nobility s homes typically range from approximately 70,000 to 220,000. Most of the prices of Nobility s homes are considered by it to be within the low to medium price range of the industry. Nobility s manufacturing plant utilizes assembly line techniques in manufactured home production. The plant manufactures and assembles the floors, sidewalls, end walls, roofs and interior cabinets for their homes. Nobility purchases, from outside suppliers, various other components that are built into its homes including the axles, frames, tires, doors, windows, pre-finished sidings, plywood, ceiling panels, lumber, rafters, insulation, gypsum board, appliances, lighting and plumbing fixtures, carpeting and draperies. Nobility is not dependent upon any one particular supplier for its raw materials or component parts and is not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure itself of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. Nobility generally does not manufacture its homes to be held by it as inventory (except for model home inventory of its wholly owned retail network subsidiary, Prestige Home Centers, Inc.), but, rather, manufactures its homes after receipt of orders. Although Nobility attempts to maintain a consistent level of production of homes throughout the fiscal year, seasonal fluctuations do occur, with sales of homes generally lower during the first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season. The sales area for a manufactured home manufacturer is limited by substantial delivery costs of the finished product. Nobility s homes are delivered by outside trucking companies. Nobility estimates that it can compete effectively within a range of approximately 350 miles from its manufacturing plant in Ocala, Florida. Substantially all of Nobility s sales are made in Florida. Retail Sales Prestige Home Centers, Inc.( Prestige ), our wholly owned subsidiary, operates ten retail sales centers in north and central Florida. Its principal executive offices are located at Nobility s headquarters in Ocala, Florida. Sales by Prestige accounted for 95 and 87 of Nobility s sales during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Each of Prestige s retail sales centers are located within 350 miles of Nobility s Ocala manufacturing facility. Prestige owns the land at eight of its retail sales centers and leases the remaining two retail sales centers from unaffiliated parties. The primary customers of Prestige are homebuyers who generally purchase manufactured homes to place on their own home sites. Prestige operates its retail sales centers with a model home concept. Each of the homes displayed at its retail sales centers is furnished and decorated as a model home. Although the model homes may be purchased from Prestige s model home inventory, generally, customers order homes which are shipped directly from the factory to their home site. Prestige sales generally are to purchasers living within a radius of approximately 100 miles from the selling retail lot. The Company s internet-based marketing program generates numerous leads which are directed to the Prestige retail sales centers to assist a potential buyer in purchasing a home.

The retail sale of manufactured homes is a highly competitive business. Because of the number of retail sales centers located throughout Nobility s market area, potential customers typically can find several sales centers within a 100-mile radius of their present home. Prestige competes with over 80 other retailers in its primary market area, some of which may have greater financial resources than Prestige. In addition, manufactured homes offered by Prestige compete with site-built housing. Prestige does not itself finance customers new home purchases. Financing for home purchases has historically been available from other independent sources that specialize in manufactured housing lending and banks that finance manufactured home purchases. Prestige and Nobility are not required to sign any recourse agreements with any of these retail financing sources. Insurance and Financial Services Mountain Financial, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Prestige Home Centers, Inc., is an independent insurance agent and licensed mortgage loan originator. Its principal activity is providing retail insurance services, which involves placing various types of insurance, including property and casualty, automobile and extended home warranty coverage, with insurance underwriters on behalf of its Prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes. As agent, we solely assist our customers in obtaining various types of insurance and extended warranty coverage with insurance underwriters. As such, we have no agreements with homeowners and/or third-party insurance companies other than agency agreements with various insurance carriers. The Company provides appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers, historical experience and other information, which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary. In the opinion of management, no reserve was deemed necessary for policy cancellations for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Wholesale Sales to Manufactured Home Communities Nobility also sells its homes on a wholesale basis through two full-time salespersons to approximately 36 manufactured home communities and independent dealers. Nobility continues to seek new opportunities in the areas in which it operates, as there is ongoing turnover in the manufactured home communities as they achieve full occupancy levels. As is common in the industry, most of Nobility s independent dealers sell homes produced by several manufacturers. Nobility does not generally offer consigned inventory programs or other credit terms to its independent dealers and ordinarily receives payment for its homes within 15 to 30 days of delivery. However, Nobility may offer extended terms to park dealers who do a high volume of business with Nobility. In order to stimulate sales, Nobility sells homes for display to related party manufactured home communities on extended terms and recognizes revenue when the homes are sold to the end users. The high visibility of Nobility s homes in such communities generates additional sales of its homes through such dealers. Regulation The manufacture, distribution and sale of homes are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has adopted national construction and safety standards that preempt state standards. HUD regulations require that manufactured homes be constructed to more stringent wind load and thermal standards. Compliance with these standards involves approval by a HUD approved engineering firm of engineering plans and specifications on all models. HUD has also promulgated rules requiring producers of manufactured homes to utilize wood products certified by their suppliers to meet HUD s established limits on formaldehyde emissions. HUD s standards also require periodic inspection by state or other third-party inspectors of plant facilities and construction procedures, as well as inspection of manufactured home units during construction. In addition, some components of manufactured homes may also be subject to Consumer Product Safety Commission standards and recall requirements. Modular homes manufactured by Nobility are required to comply with the Florida Building Code established by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulations. Nobility estimates that compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws will have no material effect upon capital expenditures for plant or equipment modifications or earnings for the next fiscal year. The transportation of manufactured homes is subject to state regulation. Generally, special permits must be obtained to transport the home over public highways and restrictions are imposed to promote travel safety including restrictions relating to routes, travel periods, speed limits, safety equipment and size. Nobility s homes are subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Federal Trade Commission rulings which regulate warranties on consumer products. Nobility provides a limited warranty of one year on the structural components of its homes.

The government measures as well as the public reaction to COVID-19 and the various variants previously had a negative impact on customer traffic (and corresponding sales) within our centers and the operations of our business partners, which has since subsided. However, whether caused by COVID-19 or other factors, we have experienced unprecedented inflation and shortages in many material products, and difficulty in hiring additional and retaining production workers, with no immediate relief in sight that have resulted in corresponding increases to our material and labor costs. The Company is monitoring these issues and has adjusted our selling prices accordingly to help offset the higher costs. Competition The manufactured home industry is highly competitive. The initial investment required for entry into the business of manufacturing homes is not unduly large. State bonding requirements for entry into the business vary from state to state. The bond requirement for Florida is 50,000. Nobility competes directly with other manufacturers, some of whom are both considerably larger and possess greater financial resources than Nobility. Nobility estimates that of the 20 manufacturers selling in the state, approximately 10 manufacture homes of the same type as Nobility and compete in the same market area. Nobility believes that it is generally competitive with most of those manufacturers in terms of price, service, warranties and product performance. Employees As of January 7, 2023, the Company had 145 full-time employees, including 32 employed by Prestige. Approximately 89 employees are factory personnel compared to approximately 74 in such positions a year ago and 56 are in management, administrative, supervisory, sales and clerical positions compared to approximately 57 a year ago. In addition, Nobility employs part-time employees when necessary. The Company has managerial, administrative, supervisory, sales and manufacturing employees. We have a focus on safety and being drug free in our manufacturing operations. Historically, we have had low turnover rates with our non-manufacturing employees. It is currently difficult for us to attract long-term quality employees for our manufacturing operations. We have experienced disruption in production as a result of our inability to find labor. We are using different hiring practices such as work release programs and employment services to reduce the turnover. However, we are still experiencing a shortage of qualified factory production employees. Nobility makes contributions toward employees group health and life insurance. Nobility, which is not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, has not experienced any work stoppage or labor disputes and considers its relationship with employees to be generally satisfactory.

 Properties As of February 1, 2023, Nobility owned one manufacturing plant as follows: 

Location 
 
 Approximate Size 

3741 SW 7 th Street Ocala, Florida 

72,000 sq. ft. 
 
 Nobility s Ocala facility is located on approximately 35.5 acres of land on which an additional two-story structure adjoining the plant serves as Nobility s corporate offices. The plant, which is of metal construction, is in good condition and requires little maintenance. In December 2021, the Company broke ground to build an 11,900 square foot frame shop constructed of concrete block and metal to manufacture steel frames for our homes, on our current manufacturing plant property in Ocala, Florida. It is anticipated that this project will be completed in fiscal year 2023.

Prestige owns the properties on which it s Ocala South, Ocala North, Auburndale, Inverness, Tavares, Panama City, Yulee and Punta Gorda, Florida retail sales centers are located. Prestige leases the property for its other two retail sales centers located in Chiefland and Hudson Florida. The Company in April 2022 sold 4.38 acres of land frontage at the Inverness location for 96,970 to the Florida Department of Transportation for SR 41 road widening project. In January 2021 the Company purchased the land for the Tavares retail sales center for 245,000, land in Ocala for a future retail sales center in February 2021 for 1,040,000 and the land for the Ocala South retail sales center in March 2021 for 500,000. 

Item 3. 
 Legal Proceedings Certain claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company does not maintain casualty insurance on some of our property, including the inventory at our retail centers, our plant machinery and plant equipment and is at risk for those types of losses.

Item 7. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Nobility focuses on home buyers who generally purchase their manufactured homes from retail sales centers to locate on property they own. Nobility has aggressively pursued this market through its Prestige retail sales centers. While Nobility actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers, its presence as a competitor limits potential sales to dealers located in the same geographic areas serviced by its Prestige retail sales centers. Nobility has aggressively targeted the retirement community market, which is made up of retirees moving to Florida and typically purchasing homes to be located on sites leased from park communities offering a variety of amenities. Sales are not limited by the presence of the Company s Prestige retail sales centers in this type of arrangement, as the retirement community sells homes only within their community. Nobility has a product line of approximately 100 active models. Although market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short-term basis, the manufacturing process is such that Nobility can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, Nobility continued to experience consumer demand for affordable manufactured homes in Florida. Our three-, four- and five-bedroom manufactured homes are favored by families, compared with the one, two and three-bedroom homes that typically appeal to the retirement buyers who reside in the manufactured housing communities. In an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with site-built housing, financing packages are available through third-party lenders to provide (1) 30-year financing, (2) an interest rate reduction program (buy-down), (3) combination land/manufactured home loans, and (4) a 5 down payment program for qualified buyers. Prestige maintains several outside financing sources that provide financing to retail homebuyers for its manufactured homes. The Company continually tries to develop relationships with new lenders, since established lenders will occasionally leave manufactured home lending. The lack of lenders in our industry, partly as a result of an increase in government regulations, still affects our results by limiting many affordable manufactured housing buyers from purchasing homes. In addition, rising interest rates have slowed the demand for retail homebuyers. Prestige s wholly owned subsidiary, Mountain Financial, Inc., is an independent insurance agent and licensed loan originator. Mountain Financial provides automobile insurance, extended warranty coverage and property and casualty insurance to Prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes. The rising interest rate environment s future impact on the housing market as well as the continued negative impact from COVID-19 and other factors on the Company s production work force, supply of certain building products and the operations of the Company are difficult to forecast for fiscal year 2023. These factors have had a negative impact on customer traffic (and corresponding sales) within our sales centers, operations of the manufacturing facility and our business partners through the most part of fiscal year 2022 and during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. In fiscal year 2022 Prestige purchased from other manufacturers 153 12,595,593) new homes to help eliminate the large backlog from Nobility. Prestige has 99 8,198,040) new homes from Nobility and outside manufacturers that are included in inventory and are in the field waiting to be completed and closed. Nobility believes that being located in Florida offers a number of advantages such as an increasing population and a low-tax and business friendly state government. However, Nobility is also aware of climate-related risks such as hurricanes, tornados, sea-level rise, flooding and wildfires which are prone to occur in Florida. To date, management does not believe these climate-related risks have adversely impacted the Company. However, management believes if such climate-related events impacted the Company s manufacturing or sales facilities, then the Company would be adversely impacted. If such climate-related events should deter future population growth in Florida, then the Company would be adversely impacted. If climate-related disclosures are required in the future by the Securities and Exchange Commission or if customary business practices should change to require greater climate-risk mitigation, then the Company would face increased compliance costs and costs of doing business. Such costs are not currently quantifiable. The Company s fiscal year ends on the first Saturday on or after October 31. The year ended November 5, 2022 (fiscal year 2022) consisted of a fifty-two-week period and the year ended November 6, 2021 (fiscal year 2021) consisted of a fifty-three-week period.

Results of Operations Total net sales in fiscal year 2022 increased 14 to 51,522,054 compared to 45,062,558 in fiscal year 2021. The Company reported net income of 7,232,029 in fiscal year 2022, an increase of 34 compared to 5,398,808 during fiscal year 2021. The demand for affordable manufactured housing in Florida and the U.S. is slowing as a result of the increased interest rate environment driven by the Federal Reserve. Although net sales increased during the twelve months ended November 5, 2022 as compared to the same period last year, we continued to experience the negative impact of limitations being placed on certain key production materials from suppliers, the delay or lack of key components from vendors as well as back orders, delayed shipments, price increases and labor shortages. These supply chain issues have caused delays in the completion of the homes at the manufacturing facility and the set-up process of retail homes in the field, resulting in decreased net sales due to our inability to timely deliver and setup homes to customers. Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on each of these areas. We expect that these challenges will continue for the first six months of fiscal year 2023 or until the industry supply chain normalizes. The Company has continued to experience inflation in most building products resulting in increases to our material and labor costs which has increased the wholesale and retail selling prices of our homes. In addition, potential customers may delay or defer purchasing decisions in light of the rising interest rate environment. According to the Florida Manufactured Housing Association, shipments for the industry in Florida for the period from November 2021 through October 2022 were up approximately 23 from the same period last year. The following table summarizes certain key sales statistics and percent of gross profit as of and for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.

 Maintaining our strong financial position is vital for future growth and success. Our many years of experience in the Florida market, combined with home buyers increased need for more affordable housing, should serve the Company well in the coming years. Management remains convinced that our specific geographic market is one of the best long-term growth areas in the country. On June 5, 2022, we celebrated our 55 th anniversary in business specializing in the design and production of quality, affordable manufactured and modular homes. With multiple retail sales centers in Florida for over 32 years and an insurance agency subsidiary, we are the only vertically integrated manufactured home company headquartered in Florida. Insurance agent commissions in fiscal year 2022 were 299,672 compared to 283,154 in fiscal year 2021. We have established appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers, historical experience and other information, which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary. In the opinion of management, no reserve was deemed necessary for policy cancellations at November 5, 2022 and November 6, 2021. Cost of goods sold at our manufacturing facilities include materials, direct and indirect labor and manufacturing expenses (which consists of factory occupancy, salary and salary related, delivery costs, manufactured home service costs and other manufacturing expenses). Cost of goods sold at our retail sales centers include appliances, air conditioners, electrical and plumbing hook-ups, furniture, insurance, impact and permit fees, land and home fees, manufactured home, service warranty, setup contractor, interior drywall finish, setup display, skirting, steps, well, septic tank and other expenses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 29 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 25 in fiscal year 2021. Our gross profit was 14,903,438 for fiscal year 2022 compared to 11,432,196 for fiscal year 2021. The gross profit is dependent on the sales mix of wholesale and retail homes and number of pre-owned homes sold. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the increase in the wholesale and retail selling prices of our homes. Selling, general and administrative expenses at our manufacturing facility include salaries, professional services, advertising and promotions, corporate expenses, employee benefits, office equipment and supplies and utilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses at our retail sales center include advertising, retail sales centers expenses, salary and salary related, professional fees, corporate expense, employee benefit, office equipment and supplies, utilities and travel. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the insurance company include advertising, professional fees and office supplies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 13 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 12 in fiscal year 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 6,477,988 for fiscal year 2022 compared to 5,286,172 for fiscal year 2021. The dollar increases in expenses in 2022 were due to the increase in variable expenses which were a direct result of employee benefits compensation due to the increase in sales. The Company earned interest in the amount of 234,804 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 180,635 in fiscal year 2021. Interest income is dependent on our cash balance and available rates of return. The increase during 2022 is primarily due to the increase in the interest rates. The Company earned 60,457 from its joint venture, Majestic 21, in fiscal year 2022 compared to 59,072 in fiscal year 2021. The earnings from Majestic 21 represent the allocation of profit and losses which are owned 50 by 21st Mortgage Corporation and 50 by the Company. The earnings from the Majestic 21 loan portfolio could vary year to year, but overall, the earnings will continue to decrease due to the amortization, maturity and payoff of the loans. We received 364,520 in fiscal year 2022 and 246,216 in fiscal year 2021 under an escrow arrangement related to a Finance Revenue Sharing Agreement (FRSA) between 21 st Mortgage Corporation and the Company. The distributions from the escrow account, related to certain loans financed by 21 st Mortgage Corporation, are recorded in income by the Company as received, which has been the Company s past practice. The increase in earnings is primarily due to the four distributions received in fiscal year 2022 compared to three distributions received fiscal year 2021. The earnings overall from the FRSA loan portfolio will continue to decrease due to the amortization and payoff of the loans. The Company realized pre-tax income of 9,436,534 in fiscal year 2022 compared to a pre-tax income of 7,118,733 in fiscal year 2021. The Company recorded an income tax expense of 2,204,505 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 1,719,925 in fiscal year 2021. Net income in fiscal year 2022 was 7,232,029 or 2.10 per basic and diluted share and net income in fiscal year 2021 was 5,398,808 or 1.50 per basic and diluted share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were 16,653,449 at November 5, 2022 compared to 36,126,059 at November 6, 2021. Certificates of deposit were 3,903,888 at November 5, 2022 compared to 2,093,015 at November 6, 2021. Short-term investments were 589,071 at November 5, 2022 compared to 621,928 at November 6, 2021. Working capital was 33,667,732 at November 5, 2022 compared to 35,563,355 at November 6, 2021. A cash dividend was paid from our cash reserves in April 2022 in the amount of 1.00 per share 3,532,976). During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate 162,570 of shares of its common stock for an aggregate of 5,195,267 and Prestige purchased from other manufacturers 153 12,595,593) new homes to help eliminate the large backlog from Nobility. Prestige new home inventory was 20,016,093 at November 5, 2022 compared to 7,140,880 at November 6, 2021. The increase in Prestige new home inventory was due to the 121 10,432,998) new homes in inventory that were purchased from other manufacturers. Prestige has 99 8,198,040) new homes from Nobility and other manufacturers that are included in inventory and are in the field waiting to be completed and closed. We own the entire inventory for our Prestige retail sales centers which includes new, pre-owned and repossessed or foreclosed homes and do not incur any third-party floor plan financing expenses. The Company incurred 1.1 million in fiscal year 2022 in building an 11,900 square foot frame shop to manufacture steel frames for our homes. In April 2022 Prestige sold 4.38 acres of land frontage at the Inverness location for 96,970 to the Florida Department of Transportation for SR 41 road widening project. A cash dividend was paid from our cash reserves in March 2021 in the amount of 1.00 per share 3,632,100). During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 100,346 shares of its common stock for an aggregate of 3,478,553. In January 2021 the Company purchased the land for the Tavares retail sales center for 245,000, land in Ocala for a future retail sales center in February 2021 for 1,040,000 and land for the Ocala South retail sales center in March 2021 for 500,000. The Company currently has no line of credit facility and no debt and does not believe that such a facility is currently necessary to its operations. The Company also has approximately 4.1 million of cash surrender value of life insurance which it may be able to access as an additional source of liquidity though the Company has not currently viewed this to be necessary. As of November 5, 2022, the Company continued to report a strong balance sheet which included total assets of approximately 62.4 million which was funded primarily by stockholders equity of approximately 47.9 million.

Looking ahead, the Company s strong balance sheet and significant cash reserves accumulated in profitable years has allowed the Company to remain sufficiently liquid to allow the continuation of operations and should enable the Company to take advantage of any market opportunities. Management believes it has sufficient levels of liquidity as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K to allow the Company to operate into the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company applies judgment and estimates, which may have a material effect in the eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The following explains the basis and the procedure where judgment and estimates are applied. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from its retail sales of new manufactured homes upon the occurrence of the following: 

Its receipt of a down payment, 

Construction of the home is complete, 

Home has been delivered and set up at the retail home buyer s site and title has been transferred to the retail home buyer, 

Remaining funds have been released by the finance company (financed sales transaction), remaining funds have been committed by the finance company by an agreement with respect to financing obtained by the customer, usually in the form of a written approval for permanent home financing received from a lending institution, (financed construction sales transaction) or cash has been received from the home buyer (cash sales transaction), and 

Completion of any other significant obligations. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of the repurchased homes upon transfer of title to the new purchaser. The Company recognizes revenue from its independent dealers upon receiving wholesale floor plan financing or establishing retail credit approval for terms, shipping of the home and transferring title and risk of loss to the independent dealer. For wholesale shipments to independent dealers, the Company has no obligation to set up the home or to complete any other significant obligations. Sales of homes to affiliated entities that are subject to contingent payment terms are considered inventory consignment arrangements. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized when the homes are sold to the end users and payment is collected by the affiliated entity. See Note 4 Related Party Transactions to the Company s financial statement included herein The Company recognizes revenue from its wholly owned subsidiary, Mountain Financial, Inc., as follows: commission income (and fees in lieu of commissions) is recorded as of the effective date of insurance coverage or the billing date, whichever is later. Commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies are recorded as revenue when received which, in many cases, is the Company s first notification of amounts earned due to the lack of policy and renewal information. Contingent commissions are recorded as revenue when received. Contingent commissions are commissions paid by insurance underwriters and are based on the estimated profit and/or overall volume of business placed with the underwriter. The data necessary for the calculation of contingent commissions cannot be reasonably obtained prior to the receipt of the commission which, in many cases, is the Company s first notification of amounts earned. The Company provides appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers, historical experience and other information, which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary. In the opinion of management, no reserve was deemed necessary for policy cancellations on November 5, 2022 or November 6, 2021. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Rebate Program The Company has a rebate program for some dealers, based upon the number and type of homes purchased, which pays rebates based upon sales volume to the dealers. Volume rebates are recorded as a reduction of sales in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The rebate liability is calculated and recognized as eligible homes are sold based upon factors surrounding the activity and prior experience of specific dealers and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we generally do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities VIE s ), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of November 5, 2022, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated entities (other than the Company s investments in Majestic 21). Forward Looking Statements Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although Nobility believes that the amounts and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse impact on our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other health pandemics, competitive pricing pressures at both the wholesale and retail levels, inflation, increasing material costs (including forest based products) or availability of materials due to supply chain interruptions (such as current inflation with forest products and supply issues with vinyl siding and PVC piping), changes in market demand, increase in interest rates, availability of financing for retail and wholesale purchasers, consumer confidence, adverse weather conditions that reduce sales at retail centers, the risk of manufacturing plant shutdowns due to storms or other factors, the impact of marketing and cost-management programs, reliance on the Florida economy, impact of labor shortage, impact of materials shortage, increasing labor cost, cyclical nature of the manufactured housing industry, impact of rising fuel costs, catastrophic events impacting insurance costs, availability of insurance coverage for various risks to Nobility, market demographics, management s ability to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel, increased global tensions, market disruptions resulting from terrorist or other attack, any armed conflict involving the United States and the impact of inflation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Nobility Homes, Inc. 

Ocala, Florida 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Nobility Homes, Inc. (the Company at November 5, 2022 and November 6, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
 period ended November 5, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 Florida retail sales centers: Ocala (2), Chiefland, Auburndale, Inverness, Hudson, Tavares, Yulee, Panama City and Punta Gorda. 
 All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). 

 Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may take in the future. The Company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic, environmental and political factors and changes in the Company s business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company s operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in the reported financial condition and results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates and assumptions by management affect: valuation of pre-owned
 homes, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the carrying value of long-lived assets, the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts, certain accrued expenses and contingencies, warranty reserve and stock-based compensation. 
 Fiscal Year

The Company s fiscal year ends on the first Saturday on or after October 31. The year ended November 5, 2022 (fiscal year 2022) consisted of a fifty-two-week

 period and the year ended November 6, 2021 (fiscal year 2021) consisted of a fifty-three-week period. 
 Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenue comes substantially from the sale of manufactured housing, modular housing and park models, along with freight billed to customers, parts sold and aftermarket services. 
 The Company recognizes revenue following the comprehensive framework of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
 from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09),
 which established a methodology for determining how much revenue to recognize and when it should be recognized through application of the following five-step approach: 

1. 
 Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

2. 
 Identify each performance obligation in the contract. 

3. 
 Determine the transaction price. 

4. 
 Allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

5. 
 Recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied. 

The Company recognizes revenue from its retail sales of new manufactured homes upon the occurrence of the following: 

Its receipt of a down payment, 

Construction of the home is complete, 

Home has been delivered and set up at the retail home buyer s site, and title has been transferred to the retail home buyer, 

Remaining funds have been released by the finance company (financed sales transaction), remaining funds have been committed by the finance company by an agreement with respect to financing obtained by the customer, usually in the form of a written approval for permanent home financing received from a lending institution, (financed construction sales transaction) or cash has been received from the home buyer (cash sales transaction), and 

Completion of any other significant obligations.

The Company considers all money market accounts and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 Certificates of Deposit

Certificates of deposits are recorded at cost plus accrued interest and have maturities of twelve months or less. 
 Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on prior collection experiences and management s analysis of specific accounts. At November 5, 2022 or November 6, 2021, in the opinion of management, no material accounts were considered uncollectible and, accordingly, no allowance was deemed necessary. 

 Accounts receivable fluctuate due to the number of homes sold to independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenues from its independent dealers upon receiving wholesale floor plan financing or establishing retail credit approval for terms, shipping of the home, and transferring title and risk of loss to the independent dealer. 

 Investments

The Company s investments consist of equity securities of a public company. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. The Company s equity investment in a public company is classified as available-for-sale 

 and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains on the available-for-sale

 securities, net of taxes, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon the Company s adoption of ASU 2016-01,
 unrealized gains and losses on these available-for-sale

 securities are reflected in the statement of income and comprehensive income.

Pre-owned
 homes are also taken as trade-ins
 on new home sales (Trade-in
 Inventory). This inventory is recorded at estimated actual wholesale value, which is generally lower than market value, determined on the specific identification method, plus refurbishment costs incurred to date to bring the inventory to a more saleable state. The Trade-in
 Inventory amount is reduced where necessary on a unit specific basis by a valuation reserve, which management believes results in inventory being valued at net realizable value. 

 Other inventory costs are determined on a first-in,
 first-out
 basis. 
 See Note 6 Inventories . 

 Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Gains or losses are credited or charged to earnings upon disposition. 
 Investment in Majestic 21

Majestic 21 was formed in 1997 as a joint venture with our joint venture partner, an unrelated entity, 21 st
 Mortgage Corporation 21 st
 Mortgage ). We have been allocated our share of net income and distributions on a 50/50 basis since Majestic 21 s formation. While Majestic 21 has been deemed to be a variable interest entity, the Company only holds a interest in this entity and all allocations of profit and loss are on a 50/50 basis. Since all allocations are to be made on a 50/50 basis and joint decisions with the joint venture partner are made which most significantly impact Majestic 21 economic performance therefore, the Company is not required to consolidate Majestic 21 with the accounts of Nobility Homes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 810, Consolidations (ASC 810). Management believes that the Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Majestic 21 is its investment in the joint venture. Based on management s evaluation, there was impairment of this investment at November 5, 2022 or November 6, 2021. 
 The Company entered into an arrangement in 2002 with 21 st
 Mortgage to repurchase certain pre-owned
 homes. Under this arrangement or any other arrangement, the Company is not obligated to repurchase any foreclosed/repossessed units of Majestic 21 as it does not have a repurchase agreement or any other guarantees with Majestic 21. However, the Company buys from 21 st
 Mortgage foreclosed/repossessed units from the Majestic 21 portfolio and acts as a remarketing agent. It resells those units through the Company s network of retail centers which management believes benefits the historical loss experience of the joint venture. The only impact on the Company s operations from this arrangement are commissions earned on the resale of these units and interest earned for the Company s carrying costs of the units while in inventory. 
 See Note 14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write-down is required. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values.

 to of the retail contract price based upon the creditworthiness of the customer. The retail customer receives the full down payment back when the Company is not able to obtain retail financing. If the retail customer receives retail financing and decides not to go through with the retail sale, the Company can withhold of the retail contract price. The Company does not typically receive any deposits from independent dealers. 
 Company Owned Life Insurance

The Company has purchased life insurance policies for certain key executives. Company owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. 
 Warranty Costs 

The Company provides a warranty as the manufactured homes are sold. 

Less: reduction for payments

() 
 
 Plus: additions to accrual

Ending accrued warranty expense

The Company s limited warranty covers substantial defects in material or workmanship in specified components of the home including structural elements, plumbing systems, electrical systems, and heating and cooling systems which are supplied by the Company that may occur under normal use and service during a period of twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to the original homeowner, and applies to the original homeowner or any subsequent homeowner to whom this product is transferred during the duration of this twelve ) month period. 

 The Company tracks the warranty claims per home. Based on the history of the warranty claims, the Company has determined that a majority of warranty claims usually occur within the first three months after the home is sold. The Company determines its warranty accrual using the last three months of home sales. Accrued warranty costs are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

 Accrued Home Setup Costs

Accrued home setup costs represent amounts due to vendors and/or independent contractors for various items related to the actual setup of the home on the retail home buyers site. These costs include appliances, air conditioners, electrical/plumbing hook-ups,
 furniture, insurance, impact/permit fees, land/home fees, extended service plan, freight, skirting, steps, well, septic tanks and other setup costs and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company has a stock incentive plan (the Plan which authorizes the issuance of options to purchase common stock. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). 
 Rebate Program 

The Company has a rebate program for some dealers based upon the number and type of home purchased, which pays rebates based upon sales volume to the dealers. Volume rebates are recorded as a reduction of sales in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The rebate liability is calculated and recognized as eligible homes are sold based upon factors surrounding the activity and prior experience of specific dealers and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were rebates earned by dealers during fiscal years 2022 and 2021. 
 Advertising 

Advertising for Prestige retail sales centers consists primarily of internet, newspaper, radio and television advertising. All costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to approximately and for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk 

The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and accounts receivable. At times, the Company s deposits may exceed federally insured limits. However, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The majority of the Company s sales are credit sales which are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in the areas where they operate; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses when deemed necessary and such losses have historically been within management s expectations. 
 Concentration of Retail Financing Sources

There are 

two national lenders that service the manufactured housing industry with several others who specialize in government insured loans (Fannie, Freddie, FHA, VA, etc.). With only a few lenders dedicated to our industry, the loss of any of them could adversely affect our retail sales.

Our President owns between a and a direct and indirect interest in each of these limited partnerships. Our Executive Vice President owns between a and a direct and indirect interest in each of these limited partnerships. The TLT Communities have purchased manufactured homes exclusively from the Company since 1990. Sales to TLT Communities were not significant during fiscal years 2022 and 2021. 
 Repurchase of Common Stock

 In April 2022, the Company repurchased shares of common stock from our President at per share. 
 for a interest in a joint venture engaged in providing mortgage financing on manufactured homes. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 While Majestic 21 has been deemed to be a variable interest entity, the Company only holds a interest in this entity and all allocations of profit and loss are on a . Since all allocations are to be made on a 50/50 basis and the Company s maximum exposure is limited to its investment in Majestic 21, management has concluded that the Company would not absorb a majority of Majestic 21 s expected losses nor receive a majority of Majestic 21 s expected residual returns; therefore, the Company is not required to consolidate Majestic 21 with the accounts of Nobility Homes in accordance with ASC 810. 

 See Note 14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . 

 We received distributions from the joint venture in fiscal year 2022 or 2021.

In assessing the ability to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that a valuation reserve for the Company s deferred tax assets was not considered necessary as the deferred tax assets were fully realizable.

 shares were reserved for issuance under the Plan, all of which may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options. The Plan was amended by the Board of Directors to extend the termination date from June 2021 until June 1, 2026. At November 5, 2022, options were available for future grant under the Plan and options were outstanding. 
 The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide a service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments (unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available). If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized compensation costs related to the vesting of stock options of approximately and respectively.

Options for the exercise of shares were exercised on a cashless basis, resulting in the net issuance of shares. 

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents total intrinsic value (of options in the money), which is the difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal year 2022 and the exercise price times the number of shares, that would have been received by the option holder had the option holder exercised their options on November 5, 2022. 

The fair value of each option is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which values options based on the stock price at the grant date, the expected life of the option, the estimated volatility of the stock, expected dividend payments, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The dividend yield was calculated by dividing the current annualized dividend by the option exercise price for each grant. The expected volatility was determined considering the Company s historical stock prices for the fiscal year the grant occurred and prior fiscal years for a period equal to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was the rate available on zero coupon U.S. government obligations with a term equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life of the option was estimated based on the exercise history from previous grants.

 Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . The Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting involves policies and procedure that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets of the issuer; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of November 5, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and determined that its internal controls were effective. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Changes in internal control over financial reporting . There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

 Deliver or delivery includes delivery by hand; United States mail; facsimile, telegraph, teletype or
other form of electronic transmission; and private mail carriers handling nationwide mail services. Distribution means
a direct or indirect transfer of money or other property (except shares in the corporation) or an incurrence of indebtedness by the corporation to or for the benefit of shareholders in respect of any of the corporation s shares. A distribution

 Principal office means the office (within or without the State of Florida) where the corporation s principal executive
offices are located, as designated in the articles of incorporation or other initial filing until an annual report has been filed with the Florida Department of State, and thereafter as designated in the annual report. 
 ARTICLE 2 Offices 
 Section 2.1 Principal and Business Offices. The corporation may have such principal and other business offices, either within or
without the State of Florida, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of the corporation may require from time to time. 
 Section 2.2 Registered Office. The registered office of the corporation required by the Act to be maintained in the State of
Florida may but need not be identical with the principal office if located in the State of Florida, and the address of the registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the registered agent. The business office

ARTICLE 3 
 Shareholders 
 Section 3.1 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held within four months after the close of each fiscal
year of the corporation on a date and at a time and place designated by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. If the election of directors shall
not be held on the day fixed as herein provided for any annual meeting of shareholders, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders as soon thereafter as is
practicable. Section 3.2 Special Meetings. 
 (a) Call by Directors or President. Special meetings of shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board (if any) or the President. (b) Call by Shareholders. The corporation
shall call a special meeting of shareholders in the event that the holders of at least ten percent of all of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date, and deliver to the
Secretary one or more written demands for the meeting describing one or more purposes for which it is to be held. The corporation shall give notice of such a special meeting within sixty days after the date that the demand is delivered to the
corporation. Section 3.3 Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State
of Florida, as the place of meeting for any annual or special meeting of shareholders. If no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation. 
 -2- 

Section 3.4 Notice of Meeting. 
 (a) Content and Delivery. Written notice stating the date, time, and place of any meeting of shareholders and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten days nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting by or at the direction of the President or the Secretary, or the officer or persons
duly calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to such other persons as required by the Act. Unless the Act requires otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called. If mailed, notice of a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the stock
record books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. (b) Notice of Adjourned Meetings. If an annual or special
meeting of shareholders is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, the corporation shall not be required to give notice of the new date, time, or place if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment;
 provided, however, that if a new record date for an adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, the corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date who are entitled to notice of the
meeting. (c) No Notice Under Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, no notice of a
meeting of shareholders need be given to a shareholder if: (1) an annual report and proxy statement for two consecutive annual meetings of shareholders, or (2) all, and at least two checks in payment of dividends or interest on securities
during a twelve-month period, have been sent by first-class, United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the share transfer books of the corporation, and returned undeliverable. The obligation of the
corporation to give notice of a shareholders meeting to any such shareholder shall be reinstated once the corporation has received a new address for such shareholder for entry on its share transfer books. 
 Section 3.5 Waiver of Notice. 
 (a) Written Waiver. A shareholder may waive any notice required by the Act or these bylaws before or after the date and time
stated for the meeting in the notice. The waiver shall be in writing and signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Neither the business to
be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice. 
 -3- 

(b) Waiver by Attendance. A shareholder s attendance at a meeting, in
person or by proxy, waives objection to all of the following: (1) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting;
and (2) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 
 Section 3.6 Fixing of Record Date. 
 (a) General. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of a shareholders meeting, entitled to vote, or take any other action. In no event may a record date fixed by the Board of Directors be a date preceding the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted or
a date more than seventy days before the date of meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. (b) Special
Meeting. The record date for determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting shall be the close of business on the date the first shareholder delivers his or her demand to the corporation. 
 (c) Shareholder Action by Written Consent. If no prior action is required by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Act, the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting shall be the close of business on the date the first signed written consent with respect to the action in question is delivered to the corporation, but if prior
action is required by the Board of Directors pursuant to the Act, such record date shall be the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action unless the Board of Directors otherwise
fixes a record date. (d) Absence of Board Determination for Shareholders Meeting. If the Board of Directors does not
determine the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders meeting, such record date shall be the close of business on the day before the first notice with respect thereto is
delivered to shareholders. (e) Adjourned Meeting. A record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at a shareholders meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the
original meeting. 
 -4- 

(f) Certain Distributions. If the Board of Directors does not determine the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation s shares or a share dividend), such record date shall be the close of business on the
date on which the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution. Section 3.7 Shareholders List for Meetings. 
 (a) Preparation and Availability. After a record date for a meeting of shareholders has been fixed, the corporation shall
prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of the shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by class or series of shares, if any, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Such list
shall be available for inspection by any shareholder for a period of ten days prior to the meeting or such shorter time as exists between the record date and the meeting date, and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation s principal
office, at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held, or at the office of the corporation s transfer agent or registrar, if any. A shareholder or his or her agent may, on written demand, inspect the
list, subject to the requirements of the Act, during regular business hours and at his or her expense, during the period that it is available for inspection pursuant to this Section. The corporation shall make the shareholders list available
at the meeting and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
 (b) Prima Facie Evidence. The shareholders list is prima facie evidence of the identity of shareholders
entitled to examine the shareholders list or to vote at a meeting of shareholders. (c) Failure to Comply. If
the requirements of this Section have not been substantially complied with, or if the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder or his or her agent or attorney to inspect the shareholders list before or at the meeting, on the demand of any
shareholder, in person or by proxy, who failed to get such access, the meeting shall be adjourned until such requirements are complied with. 
 (d) Validity of Action Not Affected. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders list shall
not affect the validity of any action taken at a meeting of shareholders. 
 -5- 

Section 3.8 Quorum. 
 (a) What Constitutes a Quorum. Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a
quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. If the corporation has only one class of stock outstanding, such class shall constitute a separate voting group for purposes of this Section. Except as otherwise provided in the Act, a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting group for action on that matter. 
 (b) Presence of Shares. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be
set for the adjourned meeting. (c) Adjournment in Absence of Quorum. Where a quorum is not present, the holders of a
majority of the shares represented and who would be entitled to vote at the meeting if a quorum were present may adjourn such meeting from time to time. 
 Section 3.9 Voting of Shares. Each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a
meeting of shareholders. Section 3.10 Vote Required. 
 (a) Matters Other Than Election of Directors. If a quorum exists, except in the case of the election of directors, action on a
matter shall be approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Act requires a greater number of affirmative votes. 
 (b) Election of Directors. Each director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Each shareholder who is entitled to vote at an election of directors has the right to vote the number of shares owned by him or her for as many persons as there are directors to be
elected. Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors. 
 -6- 

Section 3.11 Conduct of Meeting. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, and if
there be none, or in his or her absence, the President, and in his or her absence, a Vice President in the order provided under the Section of these bylaws titled Vice Presidents, and in their absence, any person chosen by the
shareholders present shall call a shareholders meeting to order and shall act as presiding officer of the meeting, and the Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the shareholders, but, in the absence of the
Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the meeting. The presiding officer of the meeting shall have broad discretion in determining the order of business at a shareholders meeting. The presiding
officer s authority to conduct the meeting shall include, but in no way be limited to, recognizing shareholders entitled to speak, calling for the necessary reports, stating questions and putting them to a vote, calling for nominations, and
announcing the results of voting. The presiding officer also shall take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to preserve order at the meeting. The rules of parliamentary procedure need not be observed in the conduct of shareholders 
meetings; however, meetings shall be conducted in accordance with accepted usage and common practice with fair treatment to all who are entitled to take part. 
 Section 3.12 Inspectors of Ejection. Inspectors of election may be appointed by the Board of Directors to act at any meeting of
shareholders at which any vote is taken. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the presiding officer of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder shall, make such appointment. The inspectors of election shall determine the
number of shares outstanding, the voting rights with respect to each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies; receive votes, ballots, consents, and waivers; hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the vote; count and tabulate all votes, consents, and waivers; determine and announce the result; and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all
shareholders. No inspector, whether appointed by the Board of Directors or by the person acting as presiding officer of the meeting, need be a shareholder. 
 Section 3.13 Proxies. 
 (a) Appointment. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or by proxy. A
shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. If an
appointment form expressly provides, any proxy holder may appoint, in writing, a substitute to act in his or her place. A telegraph, telex, or a cablegram, a facsimile transmission of a signed appointment form, or a photographic, photostatic, or
equivalent reproduction of a signed appointment form is a sufficient appointment form. 
 -7- 

(b) When Effective. An appointment of a proxy is effective when
received by the Secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for up to eleven months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. An appointment of a proxy is
revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. 
 Section 3.14 Shareholder Nominations and Proposals. Any shareholder nomination or proposal for action at a forthcoming meeting of
shareholders must be delivered to the corporation no later than the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals pursuant to Securities Exchange Commission Regulations Section 240.14a8. The presiding officer at any meeting of shareholders
shall not be required to recognize any proposal or nomination which did not comply with such deadline. Section 3.15 Action by
Shareholders Without Meeting. (a) Requirements for Written Consents. Any action required or permitted by the Act to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if one or more written consents describing the action taken shall be signed and dated by the holders of outstanding stock
entitled to vote thereon having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Such consents must be delivered to
the principal office of the corporation in Florida, the corporation s principal place of business, the Secretary, or another officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are
recorded. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the date of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required herein, written consents signed by the
number of holders required to take action are delivered to the corporation by delivery as set forth in this Section. (b) 
 Revocation of Written Consents. Any written consent may be revoked prior to the date that the corporation receives the required number of consents to authorize the proposed action. No revocation is effective unless in writing and until
received by the corporation at its principal office in Florida or its principal place of business, or received by the Secretary or other officer or agent having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. 
 (c) Notice to Nonconsenting Shareholders. Within ten days after obtaining such authorization by written consent, notice must be given
in writing to those shareholders who have not consented in writing or who are not entitled to vote on the action. The notice shall fairly summarize the material features of the authorized action and, if the action be such for which dissenters 
rights are provided under the Act, the notice shall contain a clear statement of the right of shareholders dissenting therefrom to be paid the fair value of their shares upon compliance with the provisions of the Act regarding the rights of
dissenting shareholders. 
 -8- 

(d) Sam? Effect as Vote at Meeting. A consent signed under this Section has the
effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. Whenever action is taken by written consent pursuant to this Section, the written consent of the shareholders consenting thereto or the written reports of inspectors appointed to
tabulate such consents shall be filed with the minutes of proceedings of shareholders. Section 3.16 Acceptance of Instruments
Showing Shareholder Action. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and
give it effect as the act of a shareholder. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver, or
proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply: (a) The shareholder is an entity
and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity; (b) The name signed purports to be that of an
administrator, executor, guardian, personal representative, or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent,
waiver, or proxy appointment; (c) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or assignee for the
benefit of creditors of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; 
 (d) The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory s authority to sign for the shareholder is presented with respect to the
vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; or (e) Two or more persons are the shareholder as cotenants or fiduciaries and the
name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners. 
 -9- 

The corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the Secretary or other officer
or agent of the corporation who is authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory s authority to sign for the shareholder. 
 ARTICLE 4 Board of Directors
 Section 4.1 General Powers and Number. All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the
business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors. The corporation shall have five directors. The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by vote of a majority of the full
Board of Directors, but shall never be less than one nor more than ten. Section 4.2 Qualifications. Directors must be natural
persons who are eighteen years of age or older but need not be residents of this state or shareholders of the corporation. 
 Section 4.3 Term of Office. Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her
successor shall have been elected and, if necessary, qualified, or until there is a decrease in the number of directors which takes effect after the expiration of his or her term, or until his or her prior death, resignation or removal. 
 Section 4.4 Removal. The shareholders may remove one or more directors with or without cause. A director may be removed by the
shareholders at a meeting of shareholders, provided that the notice of the meeting states that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is such removal. 
 Section 4.5 Resignation. A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Board of Directors or its Chairman
(if any) or to the corporation. A director s resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 
 -10- 

Section 4.6 Vacancies. 
 (a) Who May Fill Vacancies. Whenever any vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in
the number of directors, it may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by the shareholders. If the directors first fill a vacancy, the shareholders shall
have no further right with respect to that vacancy, and if the shareholders first fill the vacancy, the directors shall have no further rights with respect to that vacancy. 
 (b) Prospective Vacancies. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date, because of a resignation effective at a later date or
otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. Section 4.7
 Compensation. The Board of Directors, irrespective of any personal interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable compensation of all directors for services to the corporation as directors, officers, or otherwise, or may delegate
such authority to an appropriate committee. The Board of Directors also shall have authority to provide for or delegate authority to an appropriate committee to provide for reasonable pensions, disability or death benefits, and other benefits or
payments, to directors, officers, and employees and to their families, dependents, estates, or beneficiaries on account of prior services rendered to the corporation by such directors, officers, and employees. 
 Section 4.8 Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw
immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders and each adjourned session thereof. The place of such regular meeting shall be the same as the place of the meeting of shareholders which precedes it, or such other suitable place as may be
announced at such meeting of shareholders. The Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the date, time, and place, either within or without the State of Florida, for the holding of additional regular meetings of the Board of Directors without
other notice than such resolution. Section 4.9 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by
the Chairman of the Board (if any) the President or one-third of the members of the Board of Directors. The person or persons calling the meeting may fix any place, either within or without the State of
Florida, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors, and if no other place is fixed, the place of the meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation in the State of Florida. 
 Section 4.10 Notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors must be preceded by at least two days notice of the date,
time, and place of the meeting. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special meeting. 
 -11- 

Section 4.11 Waiver of Notice. Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors
need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of notice either before or after the meeting. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all objections to the place of the
meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in which it has been called or convened, except when a director states, at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival at the meeting, any objection to the transaction of business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Section 4.12 Quorum and Voting. A quorum of the Board of Directors consists of a
majority of the number of directors prescribed by these bylaws. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the Board of Directors. A director who is present at a meeting of the
Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless: (a) he or she objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon his or her arrival) to
holding it or transacting specified business at the meeting; or (b) he or she votes against or abstains from the action taken. 
 Section 4.13 Conduct of Meetings. 
 (a) Presiding Officer. The Board of Directors may elect from among its members a Chairman of the Board of Directors, who shall
preside at meetings of the Board of Directors. The Chairman, and if there be none, or in his or her absence, the President, and in his or her absence, a Vice President in the order provided under the Section of these bylaws titled Vice
Presidents, and in their absence, any director chosen by the directors present, shall call meetings of the Board of Directors to order and shall act as presiding officer of the meeting. 
 (b) Minutes. The Secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the Board of Directors but in the
absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person present to act as secretary of the meeting. Minutes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be prepared and distributed to each director. 
 (c) Adjournments. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum exists, may adjourn any meeting of the Board of
Directors to another time and place. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to the directors who are not present at the time of the adjournment and, unless the time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the time of the
adjournment, to the other directors.

shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is adequate. The determination of the Board of Directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the
issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the
transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits are received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or

represented by certificates until the certificates are surrendered to the corporation. If the Board of Directors authorizes the issuance of any shares without certificates, within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of any such shares, the
corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required by the Act to be set forth on certificates, including any restrictions on transfer. Certificates representing shares of the corporation shall be in such form,
consistent with the Act, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Such certificates shall be signed (either manually or in facsimile) by the President or any Vice President or any other persons designated by the Board of Directors and may
be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a facsimile thereof. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the
number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. Unless the Board of Directors authorizes shares without certificates, all certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled
and no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled, except as provided in these bylaws with respect to lost, destroyed, or stolen certificates. The validity of a
share certificate is not affected if a person who signed the certificate (either manually or in facsimile) no longer holds office when the certificate is issued. 
 Section 7.3 Transfer of Shares. Prior to due presentment of a certificate for shares for registration of transfer, the corporation
may treat the registered owner of such shares as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to have and exercise all the rights and power of an owner. Where a certificate for shares is presented to the
corporation with a request to register a transfer, the corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other person suffering loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a) there were on or with the certificate the necessary
endorsements, and (b) the corporation had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any such duty. The corporation may require reasonable assurance that such endorsements are genuine and effective and compliance with such other
regulations as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors. Section 7.4 Restrictions on Transfer.

corporation has notice that such shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, (b) files with the corporation a sufficient indemnity bond if required by the Board of Directors or any principal officer, and (c) satisfies such other
reasonable requirements as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors. Section 7.6 Stock

corporation. ARTICLE 8 Seal

shares in exchange for promises to render services in the future. ARTICLE 10 
 Indemnification 
 Section 10.1 Provision of Indemnification. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted or required by the Act,
including any amendments thereto (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits or requires the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than prior to such amendment), indemnify its Directors against
any and all Liabilities, and advance any and all reasonable Expenses incurred in any Proceeding to which any such Director is or is threatened to be made a Party or a witness because he or she is or was a Director. The rights to indemnification
granted hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to indemnification against Liabilities or the advancement of Expenses which a Director may be entitled under any written agreement, Board resolution, vote of shareholders, the Act,
or otherwise. The corporation may, but shall not be required to, supplement the foregoing rights to indemnification against Liabilities and advancement of Expenses by the purchase of insurance on behalf of any one or more of its Directors whether or
not the corporation would be obligated to indemnify or advance Expenses to such Director under this Article. For purposes of this Article, the term Directors includes former directors and any directors who are or were serving at the
request of the corporation as directors, officers, employees, or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan (other than in the capacity as agents
separately retained and compensated for the provision of goods or services to the enterprise, including, without limitation, attorneys-at-law, accountants, and financial
consultants). All other capitalized terms used in this Article and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in Section 607.0850, Florida Statutes (1993). The provisions of this Article are intended solely for the benefit of
the indemnified parties described herein, their heirs and personal representatives and shall not create any rights in favor of third parties. No amendment to or repeal of this Article shall diminish the rights of indemnification provided for herein
prior to such amendment or repeal. 
 -21- 

ARTICLE 11 
 Amendments 
 Section 11.1 Power to Amend. These bylaws may be amended or repealed by either the Board of Directors or the shareholders, unless
the Act reserves the power to amend these bylaws generally or any particular bylaw provision, as the case may be, exclusively to the shareholders or unless the shareholders, in amending or repealing these bylaws generally or any particular bylaw
provision, provide expressly that the Board of Directors may not amend or repeal these bylaws or such bylaw provision, as the case may be. 
 Section 11.2 Implied Amendments. Any action taken or authorized by the shareholders or by the Board of Directors which would be
inconsistent with the bylaws then in effect but which is taken or authorized by affirmative vote of not less than the number of shares or the number of directors required to amend the bylaws so that the bylaws would be consistent with such action
shall be given the same effect as though the bylaws had been temporarily amended or suspended so far, but only so far, as is necessary to permit the specific action so taken or authorized.
