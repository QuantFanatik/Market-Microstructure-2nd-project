 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available for free at www.wellsfargo.com/about/investor-relations/filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are also available for free on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov 1 . 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 General 
 We are a leading financial services company that provides a diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet (www.wellsfargo.com) and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and in countries outside the U.S. We provide consumer financial products and services including checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, and auto, mortgage and home equity, and small business lending. In addition, we offer financial planning, private banking, investment management, and fiduciary services. We also provide financial solutions to businesses through products and services including traditional commercial loans and lines of credit, letters of credit, asset-based lending, trade financing, treasury management, and investment banking services. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had four reportable operating segments for management reporting purposes: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. The 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments. 
 
 Human Capital 
 Our people are what set Wells Fargo apart and are critical to our success. Wells Fargo continues to invest in our employees by offering market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and strong work-life programs. 
 
 1 We do not control this website. Wells Fargo has provided this link for your convenience, but does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of this website. 

We have set common expectations for everyone at the Company. These expectations guide how we lead ourselves, collaborate with our colleagues, and make decisions. The following expectations apply to everyone at Wells Fargo, at every level, and in every role: 
 Embrace candor 
 Do what s right 
 Be great at execution 
 Learn and grow 
 Champion diversity and inclusion 
 Build high-performing teams (for managers) 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 238,000 active employees, with approximately 81 of employees based in the United States. 
 
 Compensation and benefits. Wells Fargo's compensation program is linked to performance management and is designed to promote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and operating standards. The compensation principles include: 
 Pay for performance : Compensation is linked to company, line of business, and individual performance, including meeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term value consistent with the interests of shareholders. 
 Promote effective risk management : Compensation promotes effective risk management and discourages imprudent or excessive risk-taking. 
 Attract and retain talent : People are one of Wells Fargo's competitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps attract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, and experience to drive superior long-term company performance. 
 
 In addition, we provide all eligible full- and part-time employees (and their eligible dependents, as applicable) with a comprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical and financial health and to help them make the most of their financial future. 
 
 Pay Equity Review. Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices and, since 2015, has conducted an annual pay equity review through engagement with a third-party expert. The review analyzes employee compensation by taking into account gender, race, and ethnicity and factors such as role, tenure, and geography. The review process can include compensation adjustments in the event we identify gaps. The 2022 review, modified for adjustments as described, showed that women at Wells Fargo earn more than 99 cents for every 1 earned by their male peers, and U.S. employees that are racially/ethnically diverse earn more than 99 cents for every 1 earned by their Caucasian/white peers. 
 
 Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Meeting the increasingly diverse needs of Wells Fargo s global customer base is critical to our Company s long-term growth and success. Wells Fargo values and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE I) in every aspect of our business. We are dedicated to recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and promote diversity in our workforce at all levels of our Company, including leadership positions. We have a strong record of recruiting, promoting, and rewarding women and racially/ethnically diverse employees at all levels of our Company, including a goal to increase diverse representation in leadership roles. Our Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and 

1 

Inclusion reports directly to our CEO and leads our DE I efforts, with responsibility for driving a Company-wide DE I strategy. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our global workforce was 52 female and 48 male, and our U.S. workforce was 55 female and 45 male. Our U.S. workforce was 54 Caucasian/white and 46 racially/ethnically diverse. 
 
 Employee training and development. We invest heavily in coaching and training for employees and managers. We believe that when our employees feel properly supported, engaged, and confident in their skills, they are more effective and can provide an even better customer experience. During 2022, we invested approximately 200 million in a variety of employee learning and development programs, including functional training, regulatory compliance, leadership and professional development, early talent development programs, and tuition reimbursement. 
 
 Work-life programs and the COVID-19 Pandemic. Wells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, and work arrangements intended to provide employees with flexibility and work-life balance. In March 2022, Wells Fargo began its Return to Office program for employees who had been working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wells Fargo believes the Company benefits from employees seeing each other on a regular basis. When together, it is easier to build relationships, get in-the-moment coaching, identify career opportunities, and brainstorm ideas. Ultimately, when employees work together we believe they learn more about the customers and communities the Company serves and how to serve them better. With this in mind, Wells Fargo's approach emphasizes spending time together in the office, and also provides flexible work options for employees in certain jobs. For example, employees in certain non-customer-facing roles have flexibility to have up to two days a week of remote work, and spend a minimum of three days a week in the office. Expectations for other roles, including customer-facing, operations, technology, and non-U.S. based employees, vary by business need. 
 The health and safety of employees also remains a priority. All employees globally may take up to four hours of paid time away for each COVID-19 vaccine appointment (including boosters). U.S. employees are additionally eligible to receive free COVID-19 test kits from Wells Fargo or through their medical plan, at no additional cost. 
 
 Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, investment banks and mutual fund companies. They also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, private equity firms and online lending companies, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures. 
 Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of 

depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 
 
 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 We describe below, and in Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders, the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies (BHCs) is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the Company. 
 Statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions. See the Regulatory Matters and Risk Factors sections in the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional information. 
 
 General 
 Parent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. 
 
 Subsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-U.S. branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Non-U.S. subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business. 
 
 Nonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. countries in which they conduct business or operate. 

2 

Parent Bank Holding Company Activities 
 Financial in Nature Requirement. We became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. As a BHC that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. Financial in nature activities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. Complementary activities are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. 
 FRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company (other than a BHC, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. In addition, the FRB has implemented a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that also prohibits our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10 of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies. 
 Because we are a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than BHCs, banks or savings associations, except that we could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are closely related to banking under the BHC Act. CRA performance is also taken into account by regulators in reviewing applications to establish bank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that the Company or any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, we would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. If we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or, in the alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the BHC Act. 
 
 Interstate Banking . Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10 of the total amount of 

deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company s initial entry into the state, more than 30 of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. 
 
 Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system. 
 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent s subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent s subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the Parent s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Parent s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent s subsidiary banks, see Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 Furthermore, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the Support Agreement ), among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the IHC ), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Any such restriction could materially and adversely impact the Parent s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations, as well as its ability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock. See the Regulatory Matters and Risk Factors sections of the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional information on the Support Agreement. 
 In addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of 

3 

dividends. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as rules that require leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. banking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions. 
 In addition, the FRB s enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers. For more information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, see the Capital Management, Regulatory Matters and Risk Factors sections of the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 
 Holding Company Structure 
 Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called covered transactions. In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20 of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A bank s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm s length terms. The Company is also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks. 
 
 Source of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support. 
 The OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency. 
 
 Depositor Preference. In the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution s non-U.S. offices. 

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company s subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. Default means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In danger of default means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. 
 
 Dodd-Frank Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous rules to implement its provisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision of large BHCs, such as Wells Fargo. This includes, among other things, rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large BHC; enhance consumer protections; prohibit proprietary trading; and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, stress testing, and recovery and resolution planning. The Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, has affected, and we expect will continue to affect, most of our businesses in some way, either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks, capital or liquidity. For more information about the Dodd-Frank Act and its effect on our business, see the Regulatory Matters and Risk Factors sections of the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 
 Capital and Liquidity Requirements and Capital Planning 
 The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by federal banking regulators. The capital rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. The FRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity. 
 From time to time, federal banking regulators propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such determinations, proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets. 
 As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires federal banking regulators to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, executive compensation and risk 

4 

management. Federal banking regulators are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards. 
 The FDI Act requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A depository institution s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. 
 In addition, the FRB s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. Federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. 
 For more information on our capital requirements and planning, see the Capital Management section of the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 
 Deposit Insurance Assessments 
 The Company s subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate. 
 The FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2 . For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's FDIC deposit insurance assessments totaled 679 million. 
 The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved. 
 
 Fiscal and Monetary Policies 
 Our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Restrictions on Affiliate Marketing 
 Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of 

banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products and services by those affiliated companies. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 USA PATRIOT Act 
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act requires the implementation of policies and procedures relating to anti money laundering, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition. 
 
 Future Legislation or Regulation 
 Economic, market and political conditions during the past several years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, affect our compensation structure, restrict or expand 

5 

the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 In January 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2022, we had remaining Board authority to repurchase approximately 250 million shares of common stock, subject to regulatory and legal conditions. The authorizations cover shares repurchased to meet employee benefit plan requirements. The Company maintains a variety of retirement plans for its employees and typically is a net issuer of shares of common stock to these plans. From time to time, it also purchases shares of common stock from these plans to accommodate employee preferences. Share repurchases are subtracted from the Company s repurchase authority without offset for share issuances. Shares may be repurchased from the different benefit plans or in the open market, subject to regulatory approval. 
 The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. See the Capital Management section in the 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional information about our common stock repurchases. 
 The following table shows Company repurchases of its common stock for each calendar month in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. In fourth quarter 2022, common stock repurchases were limited to repurchases in connection with the Wells Fargo Company Stock Purchase Plan and the Company s deferred compensation plans.

 Material Features of Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Shareholders 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan . Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees may defer receipt of salary, bonuses and certain other compensation subject to the terms of the plan. 

Deferral elections are irrevocable once made except for limited re-deferral opportunities. We treat amounts deferred by a participant as if invested in the earnings options selected by the participant, and determine the deferred compensation benefit payable to the participant based on the performance of those earnings options. The plan offers a number of earnings options, 

11 

including one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated to the common stock option in shares of common stock. Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to their deferred compensation benefits under the plan. 
 
 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors . Under the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors participants who performed qualifying investment or other financial services for participating affiliates as independent contractors were able to defer all or part of their eligible compensation payable to them by the affiliate subject to the terms of the plan. Deferral elections were irrevocable once made. Amounts deferred by a participant were treated as if invested in the earnings options selected by the participant, which determine the deferred compensation benefit payable to the participant. The plan offered a number of earnings options, including one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated to the common stock option in shares of common stock. No future deferrals may be made under this plan and participants may no longer reallocate their existing account balances under the plan among different investment options. Shares remaining available for issuance under the plan consist of shares issuable as a result of amounts credited to participant accounts denominated in our common stock to reflect cash dividends paid on the common stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly owned subsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. We have guaranteed its obligations under the plan. Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and are general unsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and the Company with respect to their deferred compensation benefits under the plan. 
 
 Norwest Corporation Directors Formula Stock Award Plan . Under the Norwest Corporation Directors Formula Stock Award Plan we awarded shares of common stock to non-employee directors. The plan allowed participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their awards, with dividends reinvested, until a future year or years as selected by the participants subject to the terms of the plan. Participants can elect one time to defer commencement of distribution of their deferral accounts if the election is made sufficiently in advance of the original distribution commencement date and the new distribution commencement date is sufficiently beyond the original distribution commencement date. Participants have no direct interest in the shares deferred under the plan and are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to payment of their deferred stock awards under the plan. No future stock awards or deferrals may be made under this plan.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO 
 SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 
 The following description of our common stock, preferred stock and depositary shares is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each of which is either filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is filed with, and applicable Delaware law. References to we , our and us in this description mean Wells Fargo & Company. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 
 This section describes the general terms and provisions of the shares of our common stock. 
 
 Authorized Shares. We are authorized to issue up to 9,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 1-2 3 per share. 
 
 Listing . Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WFC. Equiniti Trust Company serves as the transfer agent and registrar for the common stock. 
 
 Dividends . Holders of common stock may receive dividends if, when and as declared by our board of directors out of our funds that we can legally use to pay dividends. We may pay dividends in cash, stock or other property. In certain cases, holders of common stock may not receive dividends until we have satisfied our obligations to any holders of outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 Voting Rights . Holders of common stock have the exclusive power to vote on all matters presented to our stockholders unless Delaware law or the certificate of designation for an outstanding series of preferred stock gives the holders of that preferred stock the right to vote on certain matters. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common stock have no cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. This means a holder of a single share of common stock cannot cast more than one vote for each position to be filled on our board of directors. 
 
 Other Rights . If we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business, holders of common stock will receive pro rata, according to shares held by them, any of our remaining assets available for distribution to stockholders after we have provided for payment of all debts and other liabilities, including any liquidation preference for outstanding shares of preferred stock. When we issue securities in the future, holders of common stock have no preemptive rights. This means the holders of common stock have no right, as holders of common stock, to buy any portion of those issued securities. Holders of our common stock have no rights to have their shares of common stock redeemed by us or to convert their shares of common stock into shares of any other class of our capital stock. 
 
 Fully Paid . The outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. This means the full purchase price for the outstanding shares of common stock has been paid and the holders of such shares will not be assessed any additional amounts for such shares. 
 
 Restrictions on Payment of Dividends 
 
 We are incorporated in Delaware and are governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law, or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. However, under Delaware law, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of our assets. 
 
 1 

As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the ability of our bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Various federal laws limit the amount of dividends our national bank subsidiaries can pay to us without regulatory approval. State-chartered banks are subject to state regulations that limit dividends. 
 
 The terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture, we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related trust preferred securities or we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. In addition, the terms of each of our outstanding series of preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all completed dividend periods with respect to that preferred stock have been paid. 
 
 Anti-takeover Provisions Contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws 
 
 Certain provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. For example, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors. Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, may make it less likely that our management would be changed or someone would acquire voting control of our company without our board s consent. These provisions may delay, deter or prevent tender offers or takeover attempts that stockholders may believe are in their best interests, including tender offers or attempts that might allow stockholders to receive premiums over the market price of their common stock. 
 
 Preferred Stock . Our board of directors can at any time, under our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and without stockholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval could discourage or make more difficult attempts to take control of our company through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Preferred stock with special voting rights or other features issued to persons favoring our management could stop a takeover by preventing the person trying to take control of our company from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to take control. 
 
 Nomination Procedures . In addition to our board of directors, stockholders can nominate candidates for election to our board of directors. However, a stockholder must follow the advance notice procedures described in Section 3.11 of our by-laws, as amended. In general, a stockholder must deliver a written notice of the nomination to our chief executive officer and our corporate secretary at least 90 days but not more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting for consideration at an annual meeting or, for consideration at a special meeting, at least 90 days but not more than 120 days prior to the date of such meeting or, if our first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, then during the 10 days following our public announcement. Subject to all of the terms and conditions specified in the by-laws, an eligible stockholder (or a group of up to 20 eligible stockholders) who has continuously owned for three years at least three percent of our outstanding shares may also nominate and include in our proxy materials nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors and 20 percent of the board of directors.

 DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK 
 
 This section describes the general terms and provisions of our preferred stock and related depositary shares. 
 
 General . Pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, our board of directors has the authority, without further stockholder action, to issue a maximum of 24,000,000 shares of preferred stock, consisting of a maximum of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock without par value and a maximum of 4,000,000 shares of preference stock without par value. Our board of directors has the authority to determine or fix the following terms with respect to shares of any series of preferred stock the number of shares and designation or title of the shares dividend rights whether and upon what terms the shares will be redeemable the rights of the holders upon our dissolution or upon the distribution of our assets whether and upon what terms the shares will have a purchase, retirement or sinking fund whether and upon what terms the shares will be convertible the voting rights, if any, which will apply provided, however, that holders of preference stock will not be entitled to more than one vote per share and any other preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of the series. 
 
 Series L Preferred Stock . Our Series L preferred ranks senior to our common stock and to any other securities that we may issue in the future that are subordinate to the Series L preferred stock. 
 
 Dividends on shares of our Series L preferred stock are not cumulative. Holders of the Series L preferred stock are entitled to receive, if, as and when declared by our board of directors out of legally available assets, non-cumulative cash dividends on the Liquidation Preference, which is 1,000 per share of our Series L preferred stock. These dividends are payable at a rate per annum equal to 7.50 , quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, each a Dividend Payment Date , from and including the date of issuance. The right of holders of our Series L preferred stock to receive dividends is non-cumulative. 
 
 When dividends are not paid in full upon the Series L preferred stock and any parity stock, all dividends upon shares of the Series L preferred stock and such parity stock will be declared on a proportional basis, based upon the ratio of the amount of dividends declared on each series to the amount that if declared would be full dividends (including accrued and unpaid dividends as to any parity stock that bears dividends on a cumulative basis) through the next succeeding applicable dividend payment date. 
 
 Our Series L preferred stock is not redeemable and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation to redeem, repurchase or retire the Series L preferred stock. 
 
 Each share of our Series L preferred stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 6.3814 shares of our common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to anti-dilution adjustments (such rate or adjusted rate, the conversion rate ). 
 
 On or after March 15, 2013, we may, at our option, at any time or from time to time cause some or all of the Series L preferred stock to be converted into shares of our common stock at the then applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day of such period, the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130 of the then applicable conversion price of the Series L preferred stock. We will provide notice of our decision to exercise our right to cause the mandatory conversion within three trading days of the end of the 30 consecutive trading day period. The applicable conversion price at any given time will be computed by dividing 1,000 by the applicable conversion rate at such time. 
 
 3 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no holder of our Series L preferred stock will be entitled to receive shares of our common stock upon conversion to the extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become, directly or indirectly, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 9.9 of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time. Any purported delivery of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Series L preferred stock shall be void and have no effect to the extent, but only to the extent, that such delivery would result in the converting holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 9.9 of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time. If any delivery of shares of our common stock owed to a holder upon conversion of the Series L preferred stock is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this limitation, our obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and we shall deliver such shares as promptly as practicable after any such converting holder gives notice to us that such delivery would not result in it being the beneficial owner of more than 9.9 of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time. This limitation on beneficial ownership shall not constrain in any event our ability to exercise our right to cause the Series L preferred stock to convert mandatorily. 
 
 The following provisions will apply if, prior to the conversion date, one of the following events occur prior to the conversion date for shares of our Series L preferred stock 
 
 a person or group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act files a Schedule TO or any schedule, form or report under the Exchange Act disclosing that such person or group has become the direct or indirect ultimate beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of our common equity representing more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock or 
 
 consummation of any consolidation or merger or similar transaction or any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one of our subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to which our shares of common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than pursuant to a transaction in which the persons that beneficially owned (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, voting shares immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, voting shares representing a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding classes of voting shares of the continuing or surviving person immediately after the transaction. 
 
 These transactions are referred to as make-whole acquisitions. However, a make-whole acquisition will not be deemed to have occurred if at least 90 of the consideration (as determined by our board of directors) received by holders of our common stock in the transaction or transactions consists of shares of common stock or American depositary receipts in respect of common stock that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or a securities exchange in the European Economic Area or that will be traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or on securities exchanges in the European Economic Area when issued or exchanged in connection with a make-whole acquisition. 
 
 The phrase all or substantially all of our assets is likely to be interpreted by reference to applicable state law at the relevant time, and will be dependent on the facts and circumstances existing at such time. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or transfer is of all or substantially all of our assets. 
 
 Upon a make-whole acquisition, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate in respect of any conversions of the Series L preferred stock that occur during the period (make-whole acquisition conversion period) beginning on the effective date of the make-whole acquisition (effective date) and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date, by a number of additional shares of our common stock (make-whole shares) as described below. 
 
 We will notify holders, at least 20 days prior to the anticipated effective date of such make-whole acquisition, or within two business days of becoming aware of a make-whole acquisition described in the first bullet of the definition of make-whole acquisition, of the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The notice will specify the anticipated effective date of the make-whole acquisition and the date by which each holder s make-whole acquisition conversion right must be exercised, which shall be 30 days after the effective date of the make-whole acquisition. We will also notify holders on the effective date of such make-whole acquisition, or as soon as practicable thereafter, specifying, among other things, the date that is 30 days after the effective date, the number of make-whole shares and the amount of the cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the holder upon conversion. To exercise the make-whole acquisition conversion right, a holder must deliver to the conversion agent, on or before the close of business on the date 
 4 

specified in the notice, the certificate evidencing such holder s shares of the Series L preferred stock, if the Series L preferred stock is held in certificated form. If a holder s interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing our Series L preferred stock, in order to convert a holder must comply with certain conversion procedures and comply with the depositary s procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security. The date that the holder complies with these requirements is referred to as the make-whole conversion date . If a holder does not elect to exercise the make-whole acquisition conversion right within the specified period, such holder s shares of the Series L preferred stock will remain outstanding until otherwise converted but will not be eligible to receive make-whole shares. 
 
 The following table sets forth the number of make-whole shares per share of our Series L preferred stock for each stock price and effective date set forth below

 The number of make-whole shares will be determined by reference to the table above and is based on the effective date and the price stock price paid per share of our common stock in such transaction. If the holders our of common stock receive only cash (in a single per-share amount, other than with respect to appraisal and similar rights) in the make-whole acquisition, the stock price shall be the cash amount paid per share. For purposes of the preceding sentence as applied to a make-whole acquisition described in the first bullet of the definition of that term, a single price per share shall be deemed to have been paid only if the transaction or transactions that caused the person or group to become direct or indirect ultimate beneficial owners of our common equity representing more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock was a tender offer for more than 50 of our outstanding common stock. Otherwise, the stock price shall be the average of the closing price per share of our common stock on the 10 trading days up to but not including the effective date. 
 
 The stock prices set forth in the first row of the table (the column headers) will be adjusted as of any date on which the conversion rate of the Series L preferred stock is adjusted. The adjusted stock prices will equal the stock prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the stock price adjustment and the denominator of which is the conversion rate as so adjusted. Each of the number of make-whole shares in the table will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate as set forth below in our description of anti-dilution rate adjustments. 
 
 In lieu of receiving the make-whole shares, if the reference price (as defined below) in connection with a make-whole acquisition is less than 120.54 (a fundamental change), a holder may elect to convert each share of our Series L preferred stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the fundamental change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of the fundamental change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the reference price and (2) 60.27 (base price). The base price will be adjusted as of any date that the conversion rate of the Series L preferred stock is adjusted. The adjusted base price will equal the base price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the conversion rate adjustment and the denominator of which is the conversion rate as so adjusted. If the reference price is less than the base price, holders will receive a maximum of 16.5916 shares of our common stock per share of our Series L preferred stock, subject to adjustment, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series L preferred stock. In lieu of issuing our common stock upon conversion in the event of a fundamental change, we may at our option, and if we obtain any necessary regulatory approval, make a cash payment equal to the reference price for each share of our common stock otherwise issuable upon conversion. The reference price is the stock price as defined above. 
 5 

To exercise the fundamental change conversion right, a holder must comply with certain conversion procedures on or before the date that is 30 days following the effectiveness of the fundamental change and indicate that it is exercising the fundamental change conversion right. If a holder does not elect to exercise the fundamental change conversion right, such holder will not be eligible to convert such holder s shares at the base price and such holder s shares of the Series L preferred stock will remain outstanding until otherwise converted. 
 
 We will notify holders, at least 20 days prior to the anticipated effective date of a fundamental change, or within two business days of becoming aware of a make-whole acquisition described in the first bullet of the definition of make-whole acquisition, of the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The notice will specify the anticipated effective date of the fundamental change and the date by which each holder s fundamental change conversion right must be exercised. We will also provide notice to holders on the effective date of a fundamental change, or as soon as practicable thereafter, specifying, among other things, the date that is 30 days after the effective date, the adjusted conversion price following the fundamental change and the amount of the cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the holder upon conversion. To exercise the fundamental change conversion right, a holder must comply with certain conversion procedures on or before the date that is 30 days following the effectiveness of the fundamental change and indicate that it is exercising the fundamental change conversion right. If a holder does not elect to exercise the fundamental change conversion right within such period, such holder will not be eligible to convert such holder s shares at the base price and such holder s shares of Series L preferred stock will remain outstanding (subject to the holder electing to convert such holder s shares). 
 In the event of 
 
 (1) our consolidation or merger with or into another person in each case pursuant to which our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other of our property or another person 
 
 (2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case pursuant to which our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property 
 
 (3) any reclassification of our common stock into securities, including securities other than our common stock or 
 
 (4) any statutory exchange of our securities with another person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) 
 
 each of which is referred to as a reorganization event , each share of our Series L preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to such reorganization event will, without the consent of the holders of the Series L preferred stock, become convertible into the types and amounts of securities, cash and other property receivable in such reorganization event by a holder of the shares of our common stock that was not the counterparty to the reorganization event or an affiliate of such other party (such securities, cash and other property, the exchange property ). In the event that holders of our common stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the holders of the Series L preferred stock entitled to receive will be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of the shares of our common stock that affirmatively make an election. Holders have the right to convert their shares of our Series L preferred stock in the event of certain acquisitions. In connection with certain reorganization events, holders of the Series L preferred stock may have the right to vote as a class. 
 
 The conversion rate will be adjusted, without duplication, if certain events occur 
 
 (1) the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of our common stock, or a subdivision or combination of our common stock (other than in connection with a transaction constituting a reorganization event), in which event the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

(3) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of our common stock of shares of our capital stock (other than common stock) or evidences of our indebtedness or our assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (1) or (2) above or (4) below, any dividend or distribution in connection with a transaction constituting a reorganization event or any spin-off to which the provisions set forth below in this clause (3) apply) in which event the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

(4) We make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of our common stock, excluding (a) any regular cash dividend on our common stock to the extent that the aggregate regular cash dividend per share of our common stock does not exceed 0.375 0.1991 in any fiscal quarter (the dividend threshold amount) and (b) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by us or any of its subsidiaries referred to in clause (5) below, in which event, the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula

 Current market price of our common stock on any day, means the average of the volume-weighted average price of our common stock over each of the ten consecutive volume-weighted average price trading days ending on the earlier of the day in question and the day before the ex-date or other specified date with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation, appropriately adjusted to take into account the occurrence during such period of any event described in clauses (1) through (5) above. For purposes of the foregoing, ex-date means the first date on which the shares of our common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive an issuance or distribution. 
 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up and liquidation, the holders of the Series L preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of 1,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current dividend period to the date of liquidation, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock or any securities ranking junior to the Series L preferred stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with the Series L preferred stock upon liquidation and the rights of our creditors. If the amounts available for distribution upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation are not sufficient to satisfy the full liquidation rights of all the outstanding Series L preferred stock and all stock ranking equal to the Series L preferred stock, then the holders of each series of our Series L preferred stock will share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full respective preferential amount to which they are entitled. After the full amount of the liquidation preference is paid, the holders of our Series L preferred stock will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of our assets. 
 
 Holders of our Series L preferred stock do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to elect any directors, except as required by law and except for the special voting rights provided for below. 
 
 If we fail to pay, or declare and set aside for payment, full dividends on the Series L preferred stock or any other class or series of voting parity stock for six dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors serving on our board of directors will be increased by two. Subject to satisfaction of certain qualifications for persons serving as directors pursuant to regulations of any securities exchange on which our securities are then listed or traded, the holders of our Series L preferred stock, voting together as a single and separate class with the holders of all outstanding voting parity stock on which dividends likewise have not been paid, will have the right to elect two directors in addition to the directors then in office at our next annual meeting of shareholders. When dividends have been paid in full on the Series L preferred stock and any and all voting parity stock for at least four consecutive dividend periods or their equivalent, then the right of the holders of our Series L preferred stock to elect directors shall cease (but subject always to revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future nonpayment of dividends), and, if and when all rights of holders of our Series L preferred stock and voting parity stock to elect directors shall have ceased, the terms of office of all the 
 9 

directors elected by preferred stock holders under this provision shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly. 
 So long as any shares of our Series L preferred stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2 3 of the shares of our Series L preferred stock at the time outstanding, voting as a class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series L preferred stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, will be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law 
 
 any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (including the certificates of designations creating the Series L preferred stock) or our by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the holders of the Series L preferred stock so as to affect them adversely

 Series Q Preferred Stock. Our 5.85 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series Q, which we refer to as our Series Q preferred stock , with no par value, ranks senior to our common stock and to any other securities that we may issue in the future that are expressly made junior to our Series Q preferred stock, as to payment of dividends and or distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Series Q preferred stock ranks equally with our Parity Stock (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series Q preferred stock) as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 Dividends on shares of our Series Q preferred stock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series Q preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors out of legally available assets, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference amount, which is 25,000 per share of Series Q preferred stock. From July 22, 2013 to, but excluding, September 15, 2023 (the Fixed Rate Period ), these dividends will accrue at a fixed rate per annum equal to 5.85 , and from, and including, September 15, 2023 (the Floating Rate Period ), dividends will accrue at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.09 . These dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The right of holders of our Series Q preferred stock to receive dividends is non-cumulative. The Series Q preferred stock was issued on July 22, 2013, and the first dividend payment date was September 15, 2013. 
 To the extent we declare dividends on the Series Q preferred stock and on any other Parity Stock but cannot make full payment of those declared dividends, we will allocate the dividend payments on a proportional basis among the holders of shares of 
 10 

Series Q preferred stock and the holders of any Parity Stock then outstanding where the terms of such Parity Stock provide similar dividend rights. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment that may be in arrears. 
 We cannot pay dividends on our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the Series Q preferred stock or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock, other securities ranking junior to the Series Q preferred stock or Parity Stock, subject to certain exceptions, unless the full dividends for the then-current period on all outstanding shares of Series Q preferred stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. 
 We, at the option of our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors, may redeem, subject to the prior approval of the FRB, the Series Q preferred stock, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after September 15, 2023. In addition, within 90 days of our good faith determination that a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series Q preferred stock), we, at the option of our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors, may, subject to approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, redeem in whole, but not in part, the shares of Series Q preferred stock at the time outstanding prior to September 15, 2023. Any redemption shall be at the redemption price of 25,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid to the redemption date without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our Series Q preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not yet paid, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock or any securities ranking junior to the Series Q preferred stock and subject to the rights of the holders of Parity Stock or any of our stock ranking senior to the Series Q preferred stock as to such distribution and the rights of our depositors and other creditors. 
 Holders of our Series Q preferred stock do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to elect any directors, except as required by law and except for the voting rights provided for below. 
 Whenever dividends payable on any shares of Series Q preferred stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series Q preferred stock) have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal to, as to any class or series, at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of our Series Q preferred stock, voting together as a class with holders of Voting Parity Stock whose voting rights are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors of our board of directors at our next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent meeting of stockholders, by a plurality of votes cast provided that our board of directors shall at no time include more than two such directors and including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights. Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of our board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of the outstanding Series Q preferred stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Voting Parity Stock). At elections for such directors, each holder of Series Q preferred stock shall be entitled to 25 votes for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Voting Parity Stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such stock as may be granted to them). The right of the holders of the Series Q preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect such directors shall continue until such time as we have paid in full dividends for the equivalent of at least four quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent, at which time such right with respect to the Series Q preferred stock shall terminate, except as provided by law, and subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent nonpayment of dividends. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Series Q preferred stock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for directors, the term of office of all such directors then in office elected by only those holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in our by-laws. 
 In addition to any other vote required by law or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, so long as any shares of our Series Q preferred stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of our Series Q preferred stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Voting Parity Stock entitled to vote on the matter, by a vote of at least 66 2 3 in 
 11

 any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (including the certificate of designation relating to the Series Q preferred stock) or our by-laws that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series Q preferred stock 
 any amendment or alteration of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or by-laws to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the Series Q preferred stock with respect to either payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up or 
 the consummation of a reclassification involving the Series Q preferred stock or a merger or consolidation with another corporation or other entity, except holders of the Series Q preferred stock will have no right to vote under this provision if in each case (i) the shares of Series Q preferred stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which we are not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares of Series Q preferred stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series Q preferred stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of or issuance of our Series Q preferred stock or any class or series of Parity Stock or securities ranking junior to the Series Q preferred stock or any securities convertible into any class or series of Parity Stock (whether dividends payable in respect of such Parity Stock are cumulative or non-cumulative) or securities ranking junior to the Series Q preferred stock will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series Q preferred stock, and holders of the Series Q preferred stock shall have no right to vote thereon. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series Q preferred stock for this purpose), then only those series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Each holder of the Series Q preferred stock will have 25 votes per share on any matter on which holders of the Series Q preferred stock are entitled to vote, whether separately or together with any other series of our stock (the holders of any shares of any other series of stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock as may be granted to them), pursuant to Delaware law or otherwise, including by written consent. 
 Series Q Depositary Shares. Each Series Q depositary share issued by us represents a 1 1,000th interest in one share of our Series Q preferred stock. The shares of our Series Q preferred stock are deposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as depositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement, the depositary issued Series Q depositary shares, which are evidenced by depositary receipts. 
 Equiniti Trust Company acts as transfer agent and registrar and paying agent with respect to the Series Q depositary shares. 
 The depositary s office at which the depositary receipts are administered is located at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN 55120. 
 The Series Q depositary shares were issued in book-entry form through DTC. This means that actual depositary receipts will not be issued, except in limited circumstances. This means that the Series Q depositary shares will be in the form of a single global depositary receipt deposited with a DTC nominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of DTC and if the Series Q 
 12 

depositary shares are held through a broker or financial institution nominee, the beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of a depositary receipt holder described in this section. 
 The depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received on the Series Q preferred stock to the holders of record of Series Q depositary shares in proportion to the numbers of such depositary shares owned by each holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the Series Q depositary shares in proportion to the number of Series Q depositary shares held by each holder, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such distribution, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of such property and distribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the Series Q depositary shares are the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series Q preferred stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of the Series Q depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by us on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 If the Series Q preferred stock underlying the Series Q depositary shares is redeemed (i) after September 15, 2023, in whole or in part, or (ii) prior to September 15, 2023 in whole, but not in part, due to the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series Q depositary shares will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Series Q preferred stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per Series Q depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000th of the applicable redemption price per share payable with respect to such Series Q preferred stock (or 25 per Series Q depositary share), plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. If less than all the Series Q preferred stock is redeemed after September 15, 2023, the Series Q depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected pro rata, or in any other manner determined by the depositary to be fair and equitable. 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series Q preferred stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail, or otherwise transmit by an authorized method, the information contained in the notice and any accompanying proxy material to the record holders of the Series Q depositary shares relating to the Series Q preferred stock. Each record holder of the Series Q depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series Q preferred stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series Q preferred stock represented by the holder s Series Q depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series Q preferred stock represented by the Series Q depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Series Q depositary shares representing the Series Q preferred stock, it will not vote the amount of Series Q preferred stock represented by such Series Q depositary shares. 
 Series R Preferred Stock. Our 6.625 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series R, which we refer to as our Series R preferred stock , with no par value, ranks senior to our common stock and to any other securities that we may issue in the future that are expressly made junior to our Series R preferred stock, as to payment of dividends and or distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

Any redemption shall be at the redemption price of 25,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid to the redemption date without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our Series R preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not yet paid, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock or any securities ranking junior to the Series R preferred stock and subject to the rights of the holders of Parity Stock or any of our stock ranking senior to the Series R preferred stock as to such distribution and the rights of our depositors and other creditors.

 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our Series Y preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not yet paid, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock or any securities ranking junior to the Series Y preferred stock and subject to the rights of the holders of Parity Stock or any of our stock ranking senior to the Series Y preferred stock as to such distribution and the rights of our depositors and other creditors.

 any amendment or alteration of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or by-laws to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the Series Y preferred stock with respect to either payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up or 
 the consummation of a reclassification involving the Series Y preferred stock or a merger or consolidation with another corporation or other entity, except holders of the Series Y preferred stock will have no right to vote under this provision if in each case (i) the shares of Series Y preferred stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which we are not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares of Series Y preferred stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series Y preferred stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of or issuance of our Series Y preferred stock or any class or series of Parity Stock or securities ranking junior to the Series Y preferred stock or any securities convertible into any class or series of Parity Stock (whether dividends payable in respect of such Parity Stock are cumulative or non-cumulative) or securities ranking junior to the Series Y preferred stock will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series Y preferred stock, and holders of the Series Y preferred stock shall have no right to vote thereon. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series Y preferred stock for this purpose), then only those series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Each holder of the Series Y preferred stock will have 25 votes per share on any matter on which holders of the Series Y preferred stock are entitled to vote, whether separately or together with any other series of our stock (the holders of any shares of any other series of stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock as may be granted to them), pursuant to Delaware law or otherwise, including by written consent. 
 Series Y Depositary Shares. Each Series Y depositary share issued by us represents a 1 1,000th interest in one share of our Series Y preferred stock. The shares of our Series Y preferred stock are deposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as depositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement, the depositary issued Series Y depositary shares, which are evidenced by depositary receipts. 
 Equiniti Trust Company acts as transfer agent and registrar and paying agent with respect to the Series Y depositary shares. 
 The depositary s office at which the depositary receipts are administered is located at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN 55120. 
 18 

The Series Y depositary shares were issued in book-entry form through DTC. This means that actual depositary receipts will not be issued, except in limited circumstances. This means that the Series Y depositary shares will be in the form of a single global depositary receipt deposited with a DTC nominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of DTC and if the Series Y depositary shares are held through a broker or financial institution nominee, the beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of a depositary receipt holder described in this section. 
 The depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received on the Series Y preferred stock to the holders of record of Series Y depositary shares in proportion to the numbers of such depositary shares owned by each holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the Series Y depositary shares in proportion to the number of Series Y depositary shares held by each holder, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such distribution, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of such property and distribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the Series Y depositary shares are the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series Y preferred stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of the Series Y depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by us on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 If the Series Y preferred stock underlying the Series Y depositary shares is redeemed (i) after June 15, 2022, in whole or in part, or (ii) prior to June 15, 2022, in whole, but not in part, due to the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series Y depositary shares will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Series Y preferred stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per Series Y depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000th of the applicable redemption price per share payable with respect to such Series Y preferred stock (or 25 per Series Y depositary share), plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. If less than all the Series Y preferred stock is redeemed after June 15, 2022, the Series Y depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected pro rata, or in any other manner consistent with the rules and policies of the NYSE as the depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series Y preferred stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail, or otherwise transmit by an authorized method, the information contained in the notice and any accompanying proxy material to the record holders of the Series Y depositary shares relating to the Series Y preferred stock. Each record holder of the Series Y depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series Y preferred stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series Y preferred stock represented by the holder s Series Y depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series Y preferred stock represented by the Series Y depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Series Y depositary shares representing the Series Y preferred stock, it will not vote the amount of Series Y preferred stock represented by such Series Y depositary shares. 
 Series Z Preferred Stock. Our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series Z, which we refer to as our Series Z preferred stock , with no par value, ranks senior to our common stock and to any other securities that we may issue in the future that are expressly made junior to our Series Z preferred stock, as to payment of dividends and or distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series AA preferred stock for this purpose), then only those series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Each holder of the Series AA preferred stock will have 25 votes per share on any matter on which holders of the Series AA preferred stock are entitled to vote, whether separately or together with any other series of our stock (the holders of any shares of any other series of stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock as may be granted to them), pursuant to Delaware law or otherwise, including by written consent. 
 Series AA Depositary Shares. Each Series AA depositary share issued by us represents a 1 1,000th interest in one share of our Series AA preferred stock. The shares of our Series AA preferred stock are deposited with Equiniti Trust Company, as depositary. Pursuant to the deposit agreement, the depositary issued Series AA depositary shares, which are evidenced by depositary receipts. 
 Equiniti Trust Company acts as transfer agent and registrar and paying agent with respect to the Series AA depositary shares. 
 The depositary s office at which the depositary receipts are administered is located at Equiniti Trust Company, 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, MN 55120.

The Series AA depositary shares were issued in book-entry form through DTC. This means that actual depositary receipts will not be issued, except in limited circumstances. This means that the Series AA depositary shares will be in the form of a single global depositary receipt deposited with a DTC nominee. Each beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of DTC and if the Series AA depositary shares are held through a broker or financial institution nominee, the beneficial holder must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of a depositary receipt holder described in this section. 
 The depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received on the Series AA preferred stock to the holders of record of Series AA depositary shares in proportion to the numbers of such depositary shares owned by each holder. In the event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the Series AA depositary shares in proportion to the number of Series AA depositary shares held by each holder, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such distribution, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of such property and distribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the Series AA depositary shares are the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series AA preferred stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of the Series AA depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by us on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 If the Series AA preferred stock underlying the Series AA depositary shares is redeemed (i) after December 15, 2025, in whole or in part, or (ii) prior to December 15, 2025, in whole, but not in part, due to the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, Series AA depositary shares will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Series AA preferred stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per Series AA depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000th of the applicable redemption price per share payable with respect to such Series AA preferred stock (or 25 per Series AA depositary share), plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. If less than all the Series AA preferred stock is redeemed after December 15, 2025, the Series AA depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected pro rata, or in any other manner consistent with the rules and policies of the NYSE as the depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series AA preferred stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail, or otherwise transmit by an authorized method, the information contained in the notice and any accompanying proxy material to the record holders of the Series AA depositary shares relating to the Series AA preferred stock. Each record holder of the Series AA depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series AA preferred stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series AA preferred stock represented by the holder s Series AA depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series AA preferred stock represented by the Series AA depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Series AA depositary shares representing the Series AA preferred stock, it will not vote the amount of Series AA preferred stock represented by such Series AA depositary shares. 
 Series CC Preferred Stock. Our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series CC, which we refer to as our Series CC preferred stock , with no par value, ranks senior to our common stock and to any other securities that we may issue in the future that are expressly made junior to our Series CC preferred stock, as to payment of dividends and or distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Series CC preferred stock ranks equally with our Parity Stock (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series CC preferred stock) as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 Dividends on shares of our Series CC preferred stock are not mandatory. Holders of our Series CC preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors out of legally available assets, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference amount, which is 25,000 per share of Series CC preferred stock. These dividends accrue at a rate per annum equal to 4.375 , payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The right of holders of our Series CC preferred stock to receive dividends is non-cumulative. The Series CC preferred stock was originally issued on February 1, 2021. On February 9, 2021, an additional issuance of Series CC preferred stock 
 25 

occurred due to the partial exercise of an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. The first dividend payment date was March 15, 2021. 
 To the extent we declare dividends on the Series CC preferred stock and on any other Parity Stock but cannot make full payment of those declared dividends, we will allocate the dividend payments on a proportional basis among the holders of shares of Series CC preferred stock and the holders of any Parity Stock then outstanding where the terms of such Parity Stock provide similar dividend rights. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment that may be in arrears. 
 We cannot pay dividends on our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the Series CC preferred stock or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock, other securities ranking junior to the Series CC preferred stock or Parity Stock, subject to certain exceptions, unless the full dividends for the then-current period on all outstanding shares of Series CC preferred stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. 
 We, at the option of our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors, may redeem, subject to the prior approval of the FRB, the Series CC preferred stock, in whole or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after March 15, 2026. In addition, within 90 days of our good faith determination that a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series CC preferred stock), we, at the option of our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors, may, subject to approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, redeem in whole, but not in part, the shares of Series CC preferred stock at the time outstanding prior to March 15, 2026. Any redemption shall be at the redemption price of 25,000 per share plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid to the redemption date without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our Series CC preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not yet paid, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, to the date of liquidation, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of our common stock or any securities ranking junior to the Series CC preferred stock and subject to the rights of the holders of Parity Stock or any of our stock ranking senior to the Series CC preferred stock as to such distribution and the rights of our depositors and other creditors. 
 Holders of our Series CC preferred stock do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to elect any directors, except as required by law and except for the voting rights provided for below. 
 Whenever dividends payable on any shares of Series CC preferred stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock (as such term is defined in the certificate of designation for the Series CC preferred stock) have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal to, as to any class or series, at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of our Series CC preferred stock, voting together as a class with holders of Voting Parity Stock whose voting rights are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors of our board of directors at our next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent meeting of stockholders, by a plurality of votes cast provided that our board of directors shall at no time include more than two such directors and including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights. Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of our board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of the outstanding Series CC preferred stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Voting Parity Stock). At elections for such directors, each holder of Series CC preferred stock shall be entitled to 25 votes for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Voting Parity Stock being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such stock as may be granted to them). The right of the holders of the Series CC preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Voting Parity Stock) to elect such directors shall continue until such time as we have paid in full dividends for the equivalent of at least four quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent, at which time such right with respect to the Series CC preferred stock shall terminate, except as provided by law, and subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent nonpayment of dividends. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Series CC preferred stock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for directors, the term of office of all such directors then in office elected by only those holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a 
 26 

class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in our by-laws.

Wells Fargo Finance LLC is a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company. References in this section to Wells Fargo Finance are solely to Wells Fargo Finance LLC and not to any of its subsidiaries, and references in this section to the Company are solely to Wells Fargo & Company and not to any of its subsidiaries, in each case unless the context requires otherwise or as otherwise indicated. 
 The Notes 
 Wells Fargo Finance issued 5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes on October 31, 2018. The Notes are senior unsecured debt securities of Wells Fargo Finance, rank equally with all of its other unsecured unsubordinated debt and are part of a series of debt securities entitled Medium-Term Notes, Series A. Payment on the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. 
 The Notes mature on October 30, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 4.50 per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year. The initial interest payment date was April 30, 2019, and the last interest payment will occur at stated maturity. Interest payable with respect to a semi-annual interest period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If a scheduled interest payment date is not a business day, interest will be paid on the next business day, and interest on that payment will not accrue during the period from and after the scheduled interest payment date. The paying agent (as defined below) for the Notes will pay interest to the person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the record date. The record date for an interest payment date is the date one business day prior to such interest payment date. A business day means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in New York, New York. 
 The Notes are not subject to redemption by Wells Fargo Finance or repayment at the option of any holder and were issued in registered form in denominations of 1,000 each or integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. 
 The Notes were issued under the indenture, and the indenture and the Notes are governed by New York law. The indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that Wells Fargo Finance may issue thereunder.

32 

The Guarantee of the Notes 
 The Company will fully and unconditionally guarantee, on an unsecured basis, the full and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise. If for any reason Wells Fargo Finance does not make any required payment in respect of the Notes when due, the Company will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by Wells Fargo Finance under the indenture. The Guarantee is of payment and not of collection. 
 The Company s obligations under the Guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, 
 (1) the Company will not be liable for any amount of payment that Wells Fargo Finance is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by Wells Fargo Finance, and 
 (2) any defenses or counterclaims available to Wells Fargo Finance (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, its insolvency or its status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Company to the same extent as these defenses or counterclaims are available to Wells Fargo Finance, whether or not asserted by Wells Fargo Finance. 
 Holders of the Notes are direct creditors of Wells Fargo Finance, as well as direct creditors of the Company under the Guarantee. As a finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and will have no independent assets available for distributions to holders of the Notes if they make claims in respect of the Notes in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by such holders will be limited to those available under the Guarantee by the Company and that Guarantee ranks pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company. 
 The assets of the Company consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Company s ability to address claims of holders of the Notes against the Company under the Guarantee depends on the Company s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that banking and other subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval. In addition, if any of the Company s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets. The rights of the Company and the rights of its creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Company is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. 
 Indenture Provisions 
 The indenture does not contain restrictions on Wells Fargo Finance s ability to 
 incur, assume or become liable for any type of debt or other obligation 
 create liens on Wells Fargo Finance s property for any purpose or 
 pay dividends or make distributions on Wells Fargo Finance s capital stock or repurchase or redeem Wells Fargo Finance s capital stock. 
 
 The indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition, the indenture does not contain any provision which would require Wells Fargo Finance to repurchase or redeem or modify the terms of any debt securities upon a change of control or other event involving Wells Fargo Finance which may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the debt securities. 
 Consolidation, Merger or Sale 
 33 

The indenture generally permits a consolidation or merger between Wells Fargo Finance and another entity and or between the Company and another entity. It also permits the conveyance, transfer or lease by Wells Fargo Finance of all or substantially all of its property and assets and or by the Company of all or substantially all of its property and assets. 
 With respect to Wells Fargo Finance, these transactions, if a transaction other than a conveyance, transfer or lease to one or more of the Company s subsidiaries, are permitted if 
 the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than Wells Fargo Finance, is organized and existing under the laws of a domestic jurisdiction and assumes all of Wells Fargo Finance s responsibilities and liabilities under the indenture, including the payment of all amounts due on the debt securities and performance of the covenants in the indenture and 
 immediately after the transaction, and giving effect to the transaction, no covenant breach (as defined below) or event of default under the indenture exists. 
 If Wells Fargo Finance consolidates or merges with or into any other entity or conveys, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its assets in accordance with the requirements of the indenture, the resulting or acquiring entity will be substituted for Wells Fargo Finance in the indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the indenture. As a result, such successor entity may exercise Wells Fargo Finance s rights and powers under the indenture, in Wells Fargo Finance s name and, except in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of Wells Fargo Finance s properties, Wells Fargo Finance will be released from all its liabilities and obligations under the indenture and under the debt securities.

 With respect to the Company, these transactions, if a transaction other than a conveyance, transfer or lease to one or more of its subsidiaries, are permitted if 
 the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than the Company, is organized and existing under the laws of a domestic jurisdiction and assumes all of the Company s responsibilities and liabilities under the indenture, including the guarantee of the payment of all amounts due on the debt securities to the extent provided in the indenture and performance of the covenants in the indenture and 
 immediately after the transaction, and giving effect to the transaction, no covenant breach (as defined below) or event of default under the indenture exists. 
 If the Company consolidates or merges with or into any other entity or conveys, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its assets in accordance with the requirements of the indenture, the resulting or acquiring entity will be substituted for the Company in the indenture with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the indenture. As a result, such successor entity may exercise the Company s rights and powers under the indenture, in the name of the Company and, except in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the Company s properties, the Company will be released from all its liabilities and obligations under the indenture and under the debt securities. The successor entity to a consolidation or merger may be a subsidiary of the Company. In addition, the indenture permits the Company to convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to one or more of its subsidiaries without any restriction and, in that event, those subsidiaries would not be required under the indenture to assume the Company s liabilities and obligations under the indenture and the debt securities. 
 The term subsidiary in respect of any specified person means any corporation more than 50 of the outstanding shares of voting stock, except for directors qualifying shares, of which shall at the time be owned, directly or indirectly by such specified person or by one or more of the subsidiaries of such specified person, or by such specified person and one or more other subsidiaries of such specified person.

 34 

Events of Default and Covenant Breaches 
 An event of default , with respect to any series of debt securities, means any of the following 
 (1) failure to pay interest on any debt security of that series for 30 days after the payment is due 
 (2) failure to pay the principal of or any premium on any debt security of that series for 30 days after the payment is due 
 (3) the entry by a court having jurisdiction of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of Wells Fargo Finance in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging Wells Fargo Finance a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking receivership, insolvency or liquidation of or in respect of Wells Fargo Finance under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official of Wells Fargo Finance, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days 
 (4) the commencement by Wells Fargo Finance of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, the appointment of a receiver for Wells Fargo Finance under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law following consent by the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo Finance to such appointment, or the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of Wells Fargo Finance in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or similar law following Wells Fargo Finance s consent to such decree or order or 
 (5) the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the indenture, or the Company denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided that no event of default with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Company or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11, or the appointment of a receiver for the Company under the Dodd-Frank Act or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the guarantee in any receivership of the Company, or the commencement of any proceeding under any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law, or a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official having been appointed for or having taken possession of the Company or its property, or the institution of any other comparable judicial or regulatory proceedings relative to the Company, or to the creditors or property of the Company. 
 If an event of default for any series of debt securities occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series may declare the entire principal of all the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. If such a declaration occurs, the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series can, subject to conditions, rescind the declaration. The holders of Wells Fargo Finance s debt securities will not have the right to accelerate the payment of principal of the debt securities as a result of a covenant breach or Wells Fargo Finance s failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in the debt securities or the indenture other than the obligations to pay principal and interest on the debt securities. 
 Events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation relating to the Company will not constitute an event of default with respect to any series of Wells Fargo Finance s debt securities. In addition, failure by the Company to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an event of default with respect to any series of Wells Fargo Finance s debt securities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation relating to the Company (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to Wells Fargo Finance) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against Wells Fargo Finance or the Company upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Company. Instead, even if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation relating to the Company has occurred, the trustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable unless there is an event of default with respect to that series as described above, such as Wells Fargo Finance s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation or a payment default by Wells Fargo Finance or the Company on the relevant debt securities. 
 35 

A covenant breach , when used in the indenture with respect to any series of debt securities, means failure to perform any covenant in the indenture that applies to debt securities of that series for 90 days after Wells Fargo Finance LLC and the Company have received written notice of the failure to perform in the manner specified in the indenture. 
 A covenant breach shall not be an event of default, and neither the trustee nor any holder of debt securities will have any acceleration rights if a covenant breach occurs or continues. 
 The indenture requires each of Wells Fargo Finance and the Company to file an officers certificate with the trustee each year that states, to the knowledge of a certifying officer, whether or not any defaults exist under the terms of the indenture. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except defaults in the payment of principal, premium, interest or any sinking fund installment, if it considers the withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders. For purposes of this paragraph, default means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, a covenant breach with respect to the debt securities of a series or an event of default under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of the applicable series. 
 Other than its duties in the case of a covenant breach or an event of default, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the trustee indemnification. If indemnification is provided, then, subject to other rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may, with respect to the debt securities of that series, direct the time, method and place of 
 conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or 
 exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee. 
 The holder of a debt security of any series will have the right to begin any proceeding with respect to the indenture or for any remedy only if 
 the holder has previously given the trustee written notice of a continuing covenant breach or event of default with respect to that series 
 
 the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made a written request of, and offered reasonable indemnification to, the trustee to begin such proceeding with respect to such covenant breach or event of default 
 the trustee has not started such proceeding within 60 days after receiving the request and 
 the trustee has not received directions inconsistent with such request from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series during those 60 days. 
 However, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute right to receive payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the debt security when due and to institute suit to enforce this payment. 
 Modification and Waiver 
 Under the Indenture, certain of the rights and obligations of Wells Fargo Finance and the Company and certain of the rights of holders of the debt securities may be modified or amended with the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series of debt securities affected by the modification or amendment, acting as one class. However, the following modifications and amendments will not be effective against any holder without its consent 
 a change in the stated maturity date of any payment of principal or interest 
 a reduction in payments due on the debt securities 
 36 

a change in the place of payment or currency in which any payment on the debt securities is payable 
 a limitation of a holder s right to sue Wells Fargo Finance for the enforcement of payments due on the debt securities 
 a reduction in the percentage of outstanding debt securities required to consent to a modification or amendment of the indenture or required to consent to a waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the indenture or certain defaults under the indenture

 make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect any holder or release the Company from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the indenture and 
 a modification of any of the foregoing requirements contained in the indenture. 
 Under the indenture, the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series of debt securities affected by a particular covenant or condition, acting as one class, may, on behalf of all holders of such series of debt securities, waive compliance by Wells Fargo Finance or the Company, as applicable, with any covenant or condition contained in the indenture unless Wells Fargo Finance specifies that such covenant or condition cannot be so waived at the time Wells Fargo Finance establishes the series. 
 In addition, under the indenture, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series of debt securities may, on behalf of all holders of that series, waive any past default under the indenture, except 
 a default in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any debt securities of that series or 
 a default under any provision of the indenture which itself cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holders of each outstanding debt security of that series.

 22 

more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and or the Employer (or an Affiliate, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as the Company may specify from time to time, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following (1) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and or the Employer (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon vesting and settlement of the Restricted Share Rights either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent) or (3) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting and settlement of the Restricted Share Rights.

Only if withholding in shares of Common Stock is prevented by applicable law or has materially adverse accounting or tax consequences, may the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation for individuals subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (1) and (2) above. 
 Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent.

If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Share Rights, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. 
 Finally, you shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares, or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

not divulge, use or disclose this information except for that purpose. In addition, you agree that, both during and after your employment, you will not remove, share, disseminate or otherwise use WFC s Trade Secrets to directly or indirectly solicit, participate in or induce the solicitation of any of WFC s clients, customers, or prospective customers for the purpose of providing products or services that are in competition with WFC s products or services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Award Agreement prohibits or restricts you (or your attorney) from initiating communications directly with, or responding to any inquiry from, or providing testimony before, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any self-regulatory organization or governmental authority charged with the enforcement of any laws. 
 (b) Assignment of Inventions. You acknowledge and agree that all inventions and all worldwide intellectual property rights that you make, conceive or first reduce to practice (alone or in conjunction with others) during your employment with WFC are owned by WFC that (1) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to WFC s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of WFC whether or not you made, conceived or first reduced the inventions to practice during normal working hours and (2) involve the use of any time, material, information, or facility of WFC. 
 (c) Non-solicitation. If you are currently subject to a TSA, you shall continue to be bound by the applicable and enforceable terms of the TSA. You also agree to the below terms independently of, and in addition to, any obligation to which you are subject under the terms of the TSA.

 ii. to the fullest extent enforceable under the applicable state law, solicit, participate in or induce the solicitation of any of WFC s clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom you had Material Contact and or regarding whom you received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services that are in competition with WFC s products or services. Material Contact means interaction between you and the customer, client or prospective customer within one (1) year prior to your last day as an Employee which takes place to manage, service or further the business relationship. 
 The one-year limitation is not intended to limit WFC s right to prevent misappropriation of its Confidential Information beyond the one-year period. This paragraph 9(c) s restriction on solicitation does not apply to employees who primarily reside in California or whose primary work location for the Company or an Affiliate, at the time of the termination of their employment, was California. 
 (d) Notice Period. In order to ensure a smooth transition of business and relationships, if you are an employee with a job title and or job description set forth in Exhibit A , you agree to provide the Company with 90 days advance written notice before resigning or Retiring from the Company or an Affiliate. The required timing of such advance written notice is set forth in Exhibit A, corresponding to your job title and or job description, with the number of days between your notice and your resignation or Retirement constituting the length of your required notice period. 
 
 To the fullest extent enforceable under applicable state law, this provision shall apply unless a longer notice period is applicable to you pursuant to a Company or Affiliate policy or an agreement between you and the Company or an Affiliate, in which case such longer notice period shall be required. You hereby acknowledge and agree that during your applicable notice period, you will continue to be an employee of the Company or an Affiliate and will be required to assist in the transition of your responsibilities provided, however, that the Company may instruct you not to report to work during your notice period and may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to Company systems, shorten the duration of your notice period, or waive your notice period. During any applicable notice period (as shortened by the Company, if applicable), you will continue to receive your base salary. Failure to comply with the notice period applicable to you will cause any then unvested Restricted Share Rights awarded hereby (including any Restricted Share Rights granted with respect to dividend equivalents as provided above) to immediately terminate and be forfeited without notice to you. 
 (e) Violation of TSA or Restrictive Covenants. If you breach any of the terms of a TSA and or the restrictive covenants in paragraph 9(a), (b) or (c) above or the applicable notice period requirement in paragraph 9(d) above, all unvested Restricted Share Rights shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited. For any Restricted Share Rights that vested within one (1) year prior to the termination of your employment with WFC or at any time after your termination, you may be required to repay or otherwise reimburse WFC an amount having a value equal to the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date of vesting) of such vested shares. This paragraph does not constitute the Company s exclusive remedy for violation of your restrictive covenant obligations, and WFC may seek any additional legal or equitable remedy, including injunctive relief, for any such violation. 
 10. No Employment Agreement. If you are an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, neither the award to you of the Restricted Share Rights nor the delivery to you of this Award Agreement or any other document relating to the Restricted Share Rights will confer on you the right to continued employment with the Company or any 
 24 

Affiliate.

The Company will have no liability to you or to any other party if the Award or payment of the Award that is intended to be compliant with Section 409A is not so compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. 
 12. Six-month Delay . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if, upon your Separation from Service for any reason, the Company determines that you are a Specified Employee for purposes of Section 409A and in accordance with guidelines established by the Company from time to time, your Restricted Share Rights, if subject to settlement upon your Separation from Service and if required pursuant to Section 409A, will not settle before the date that is the first business day following the six-month anniversary of such Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death. 
 13. Stock Ownership Policy. If you are an Executive Officer of the Company or a member of its Operating Committee, as a condition to receiving this Award, you agree that you are subject to the Company s stock ownership policy, as may be amended from time to time, and that as a result, you may be required to hold, including after your retirement, all or a portion of any shares of Common Stock issued to you pursuant to this Award in order to achieve compliance with such stock ownership policy. 
 14. Severability and Judicial Modification. If any provision of this Award Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under pertinent state law or otherwise or the Company elects not to enforce any such provision, including but not limited to paragraph 9(c)(ii), the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified only to the extent necessary to render that provision valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the invalid or unenforceable provision cannot be, or is not, modified, that provision shall be severed from this Award Agreement and all other provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

 17. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with applicable law or facilitate the administration of the Plan and provided the imposition of the term or condition will not result in adverse accounting expense to the Company, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you die following an event described in this paragraph 4(c), any unvested Restricted Share Rights will vest in accordance with paragraph 4(b). 
 (d) If you experience a Separation from Service for a reason other than those addressed above, without Cause, and you satisfy the definition of Retirement either on your Separation from Service date or following your Separation from Service at the end of an approved leave of absence not to exceed six months, then provided that you continue to satisfy such definition definition s vesting condition through each applicable Award settlement date and that you complete any attestation to that effect as may be required by the Company, any unvested Restricted Share Rights awarded hereby (including any Restricted Share Rights granted with respect to dividend equivalents as provided below) will continue to vest and be settled upon the scheduled vesting date as set forth in paragraph 2 above, subject to the Clawback Policy and the other terms of paragraph 3 above and the restrictions in paragraphs 8 and 9 below provided that beginning immediately after you cease to be an Employee and continuing until the last vesting date upon which all Restricted Share Rights granted hereunder shall become vested, to the fullest extent enforceable under applicable state law, you do not perform services as an officer, director, employee, consultant or otherwise for any business which is in competition with any line of business of the Company or any Affiliate for which you performed your responsibilities while you were employed by the Company or any Affiliate (including predecessors thereof) and which does business in any location in the geographic footprint of the Company or any Affiliate for which you performed your responsibilities (the vesting condition ). For purposes of this Award, the term Retirement is defined as termination of employment after reaching (i) age 55 with five completed years of service or (ii) such more favorable treatment as may apply based on the practices of the Company in effect from time to time . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you die following Retirement, any unvested Restricted Share Rights will vest in accordance with paragraph 4(b), provided that you satisfied the definition of Retirement Retirement s vesting condition immediately prior to your date of death. If at any point you no longer satisfy the definition of Retirement Retirement s vesting condition , all unvested Restricted Share Rights shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited. 
 (e) If your employment terminates other than for a reason described in paragraphs 4(b), (c) or (d) above, any unvested Restricted Share Rights awarded hereby (including any Restricted Share Rights granted with respect to dividend equivalents as provided below) will immediately terminate without notice to you and will be forfeited. 
 5. Dividend Equivalents. During the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date the applicable Restricted Share Rights vest and are distributed, or are forfeited, whichever occurs first, if the Company pays a dividend on the Common Stock, you will automatically receive, as of the payment date for such dividend, dividend equivalents in the form of additional Restricted Share Rights based on the amount or number of shares that would have been paid on the Restricted Share Rights had they been issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date and, if a cash dividend, the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the dividend payment date. You will also automatically receive dividend equivalents with respect to such additional Restricted Share Rights, to be granted in the same manner. Restricted Share Rights granted with respect to dividend equivalents will be subject to the same vesting schedule and other terms and conditions as the underlying Restricted Share Rights, including the Company s right of recoupment or forfeiture, and will be 
 2 

distributed in shares of Common Stock when, and if, the underlying Restricted Share Rights are settled and distributed. 
 6. Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Company or an Affiliate which is your employer (the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to you even if technically due by the Company or the Employer Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount (if any) withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company and or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Share Rights, the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon settlement of the Restricted Share Rights, the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and or any dividend equivalents and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as the Company may specify from time to time, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following (1) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and or the Employer (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon vesting and settlement of the Restricted Share Rights either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent) or (3) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting and settlement of the Restricted Share Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), the Company will withhold in shares of Common Stock upon the relevant tax withholding event, except with respect to any Tax-Related Items required to be withheld prior to the vesting dates set forth in paragraph 2 which may be withheld from your wages or other cash compensation. Only if withholding in shares of Common Stock is prevented by applicable law or has materially adverse accounting or tax consequences, may the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation for individuals subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (1) and (2) above. 
 Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. Anything to the contrary in this paragraph 6 notwithstanding, the Company s or the Employer s right to withhold any amounts payable pursuant to this Award to cover Tax-Related Items for any portion of the Award that is considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A (as defined in paragraph 11 below) shall be limited to the minimum amount permitted to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Section 409A. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Share Rights, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. 
 Finally, you shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares, or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
 7. Nontransferable. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, (i) no rights under this Award will be assignable or transferable, and neither you nor your Beneficiary will have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber any rights under this Award, and (ii) the rights and the benefits of this Award may be exercised and received during your lifetime only by you or your legal representative.

including compliance with the requirements of 12 C.F.R.

For the avoidance of doubt, regulatory approval under Part 359 or any orders to which the Company is a party may be required for the issuance of Common Stock hereunder in certain circumstances, and the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to request such approval in accordance with the requirements of Part 359 or any applicable order or that any requested approval will be received. Subject to paragraphs 11 and 12 below, the Committee or its delegate may, in its sole discretion and without your consent, reduce, delay vesting, modify, revoke, cancel, impose additional conditions and restrictions on or recover all or a portion of this Award if the Committee or its delegate deems it necessary or advisable to comply with, or to promote or facilitate compliance with, applicable laws, rules and regulations or as required under any procedures or policies implemented by the Company in furtherance of such legal or regulatory compliance.

 Financial Review 
 Overview 
 Wells Fargo Company is a leading financial services company that has approximately 1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one in three U.S. households and more than 10 of small businesses in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on Fortune s 2022 rankings of America s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at December 31, 2022. 
 Wells Fargo s top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, business restrictions, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant. While we still have significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. 
 
 Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management 
 On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 

provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 
 
 Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
 On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of 1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate. 
 
 Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities 
 On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party

 Wells Fargo Company 

residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the Company s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided. 
 
 Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage Lending 
 On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile protection agreements; comply with certain business practice requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a 1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions. 
 
 Retail Sales Practices Matters 
 In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers received products and services they did not request. As a result, it remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive action plan that includes making things right for our customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 
 For additional information regarding retail sales practices matters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the Risk Factors section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Customer Remediation Activities 
 Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 
 We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. 
 For additional information regarding accruals for customer remediation, see the Expenses section in Note 20 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional information regarding these activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the Risk Factors section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
 LIBOR Transition 
 The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. 
 In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB s final rule. 
 We no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject to limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our operational readiness such as the development of new alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, and employee training. 
 For certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities and related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the June 30, 2023 cessation date. 
 Following June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our consumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. 
 For additional information regarding the risks and potential impact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the Risk Factors section in this Report. 

Wells Fargo Company 3 

Overview (continued) 

 Financial Performance 
 In 2022, we generated 13.2 billion of net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of 3.14, compared with 21.5 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 4.95 in 2021. Financial performance for 2022, compared with 2021, included the following: 
 total revenue decreased due to lower net gains from equity securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset by higher net interest income; 
 provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment; 
 noninterest expense increased due to higher operating losses, partially offset by lower personnel expense, and professional and outside services expense; 
 average loans increased driven by loan growth across both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
 average deposits decreased driven by reductions in Corporate and Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, and Corporate, partially offset by growth in Consumer Banking and Lending. 
 
 Capital and Liquidity 
 We maintained a strong capital position in 2022. Total equity of 181.9 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased compared with 190.1 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. Our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2022, including: 
 our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.60 under the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 9.20 ; 
 our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.27 , compared with the regulatory minimum of 21.50 ; and 
 our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 122 , which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100 . 
 See the Capital Management and the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding sections in this Report for additional information regarding our capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
 Credit quality reflected the following: 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 13.6 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased 179 million from December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. 
 Our provision for credit losses for loans was 1.5 billion in 2022, compared with (4.2) billion in 2021, reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. 
 The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.42 at December 31, 2022, compared with 1.54 at December 31, 2021. 
 Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were 79 million, or 1 basis point of average commercial loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 295 million, or 6 basis points, in 2021, driven by lower losses in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios. 
 Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were 1.5 billion, or 39 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 1.3 billion, or 33 basis points, in 2021, predominantly due to higher losses in our auto portfolio. 
 Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of 5.8 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased 1.6 billion, or 21 , from December 31, 2021, driven by improved credit quality across our commercial loan portfolios, and a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans primarily due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-19-related accommodation programs. NPAs represented 0.60 of total loans at December 31, 2022.

 (2) Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders equity. 
 (3) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the Capital Management Tangible Common Equity section in this Report.

Earnings Performance 
 Wells Fargo net income for 2022 was 13.2 billion 3.14 diluted EPS), compared with 21.5 billion 4.95 diluted EPS) in 2021. Net income decreased in 2022, compared with 2021, due to a 13.9 billion decrease in noninterest income, a 5.7 billion increase in provision for credit losses, and a 3.5 billion increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 9.2 billion increase in net interest income, a 3.5 billion decrease in income tax expense, and a 2.0 billion decrease in net income from noncontrolling interests. 
 For a discussion of our 2021 financial results, compared with 2020, see the Earnings Performance section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 
 Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. 

Net interest income and net interest margin increased in 2022, compared with 2021, due to the impact of higher interest rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt . 
 Table 3 presents the individual components of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in Table 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21 federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 (1) The average balance amounts represent amortized costs, except for certain held-to-maturity debt securities, which exclude unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of those securities from available-for-sale debt securities. The interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period and are annualized. Interest rates and amounts include the effects of hedge and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 
 (2) Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories. 
 (3) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of 436 million, 427 million and 494 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, predominantly related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and securities.

Table 4 allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely 

allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the absolute value of the change due to average volume and average rate.

 Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 
 Deposit-related fees decreased reflecting: 
 lower treasury management fees on commercial accounts driven by a higher earnings credit rate due to an increase in interest rates; and 
 the elimination of non-sufficient funds and other fees as well as efforts to help customers avoid overdraft fees; 
 partially offset by: 
 lower fee waivers as 2021 included additional accommodations to support customers. 
 
 Lending-related fees decreased reflecting lower commercial loan commitment fees. 
 
 Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased reflecting: 
 lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 2021; and 
 lower average market valuations. 
 
 For additional information on certain client investment assets, see the Earnings Performance Operating Segment Results Wealth and Investment Management WIM Advisory Assets section in this Report. 
 
 Commissions and brokerage services fees decreased driven by lower transactional revenue. 
 
 Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market activity. 
 Card fees increased reflecting higher network revenue as well as higher interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes. 

Net servicing income increased driven by a lower decline in residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) as a result of reduced prepayment rates, partially offset by net unfavorable hedge results due to interest rate volatility. 
 Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
 driven by: 
 lower residential mortgage origination volumes and lower gain on sale margins; and 
 lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 
 
 For additional information on servicing income and net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales, s ee Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Net gains from trading activities increased driven by higher commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities trading revenue. 
 
 Net gains from debt securities decreased due to lower gains on sales of corporate debt securities and agency MBS . 
 
 Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
 lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses; 
 a 2.5 billion impairment of equity securities (before the impact of noncontrolling interests) in 2022 predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business driven by market conditions; and 
 lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities. 
 Lease income increased driven by a 268 million impairment in 2021 of certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business that are used for the transportation of coal products.

O ther income decreased driven by: 
 gains in 2021 on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business, our student loan portfolio, and Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM); and 
 higher amortization due to growth in wind energy investments (offset by benefits and credits in income tax expense); 

partially offset by: 
 lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that we sold.

 Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
 lower revenue-related compensation expense; and 
 the impact of divestitures and efficiency initiatives; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher severance expense primarily in Home Lending. 
 
 Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense increased due to higher expense for technology contracts. 
 
 Occupancy expense decreased driven by lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expense. 
 
 Operating losses increased reflecting a 5.1 billion increase in expenses for litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters. 

As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses in the coming quarters. 
 
 Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and contractors.

 Operating Segment Results 
 Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. 
 
 Funds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 
 Revenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. 
 When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. 
 Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company s consolidated financial results. 
 Allocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment s use of capital. 
 Selected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.

 (1) Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
 (2) Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
 (3) Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
 (4) Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
 (5) Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
 (6) Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
 (7) Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
 (8) Excludes nonaccrual loans. 
 (9) Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. 
 Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 
 Revenue increased driven by: 
 higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates and higher average deposit balances and deposit spreads; 
 higher card fees reflecting higher network revenue as well as higher interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes; and 
 higher deposit-related fees reflecting lower fee waivers as 2021 included additional accommodations to support customers, and a higher volume of monthly account service fees in 2022, partially offset by the elimination of non-sufficient funds and other fees in 2022 as well as initiatives to help customers avoid overdraft fees; 
 partially offset by: 
 lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, and lower 

revenue related to the resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth, a less favorable economic environment, and higher net charge-offs. 
 Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
 higher operating losses reflecting higher expenses primarily related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters; and 
 higher operating costs; 
 partially offset by: 
 lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related incentive compensation in Home Lending due to lower production and the impact of efficiency initiatives, partially offset by higher severance expense; 

Wells Fargo Company 15 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

 lower occupancy expense as well as lower professional and outside services expense related to efficiency initiatives; and 

lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP processing fees in 2021.

 Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 
 Total loans (average) decreased driven by: 
 a decline in PPP loans in Consumer and Small Business Banking; and 
 a decline in Home Lending loan balances due to the resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools and the continued pause in originating home equity loans; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher customer purchase volume and the impact of new products in our Credit Card business; and 
 higher loan balances in our Auto business. 
 Total loans (period-end) increased driven by: 
 originations exceeding paydowns in Home Lending; 
 higher customer purchase volume and the impact of new products in our Credit Card business; and 
 growth in our Personal Lending business; 
 partially offset by: 
 a decline in our Auto business due to lower origination volumes reflecting credit tightening actions and rising interest rates; and 
 a decline in PPP loans in Consumer and Small Business Banking. 

Total deposits (average) increased driven by higher levels of customer liquidity and savings in the first half of 2022, partially offset by increased consumer spending in the second half of 2022, customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives, and lower servicing escrow deposits. 
 Total deposits (period-end) decreased driven by increased consumer spending, customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives, and lower servicing escrow deposits.

 Revenue increased driven by: 
 higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances; and 
 higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities trading revenue; 
 partially offset by: 
 lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity; and 

lower other noninterest income driven by lower mortgage banking income due to lower commercial MBS gain on sale margins and volumes. 
 
 Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. 
 Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs and operating losses, partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives.

 Revenue increased driven by: 
 higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances; 
 partially offset by: 
 lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees due to lower average market valuations and net outflows of advisory assets; and 
 lower commissions and brokerage services fees driven by lower transactional revenue. 
 Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
 lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related compensation; and 
 the impact of efficiency initiatives.

 WIM Advisory Assets In addition to transactional accounts, WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the distinct services provided, and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage of the market value of these assets. Table 9h presents advisory assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

 (1) Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company s consolidated venture capital investments. 
 Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 
 Revenue decreased driven by: 
 lower net gains from equity securities due to lower unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and higher impairment driven by market conditions; 
 lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees reflecting divestitures in 2021; 
 lower gains on sales of corporate debt securities; and 
 gains in 2021 on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business, our student loan portfolio, and WFAM; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher net gains from trading activities; 
 lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that we sold; and 
 higher lease income driven by a 268 million impairment in 2021 of certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business that are used for the transportation of coal products. 
 
 Provision for credit losses decreased due to lower net charge-offs driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio in 2021. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased due to: 
 higher operating losses reflecting higher expenses primarily related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation and regulatory matters; 

partially offset by: 
 the impact of divestitures; 
 a write-down of goodwill in 2021 related to the sale of our student loan portfolio; 
 lower lease expense driven by lower depreciation expense from a reduction in the size of our rail car leasing business; and 
 lower restructuring charges. 
 
 Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had long-lived operating lease assets, net of accumulated depreciation, of 4.7 billion and 5.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The average age of our rail cars is 22 years and the rail cars are typically leased to customers under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 55 of our rail car fleet as of December 31, 2022, were rail cars used for the transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand products. Impairment may result in the future based on changing economic and market conditions affecting the long-term demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental rates as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. For additional information on the accounting for impairment of operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 8 (Leasing Activity) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 
 Total assets (average and period-end) decreased reflecting: 
 a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash managed by corporate treasury as a result of payments on long-term debt and an increase in loans originated in the operating segments; and 
 lower available-for-sale debt securities due to sales and net unrealized losses as well as a transfer from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities related to portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. 
 
 Total deposits (average) decreased driven by the transition of deposits related to divested businesses. 
 
 Total deposits (period-end) increased driven by issuances of certificates of deposit (CDs), partially offset by the transition of deposits related to divested businesses.

 (1) Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of 6 million and 8 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and 85 million and 96 million related to held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (2) Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
 (3) Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Table 10 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. The size and composition of our AFS and HTM debt securities is dependent upon the Company s liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt securities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall economic or market conditions, which could influence loan origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances and mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be rebalanced to meet the Company s interest rate risk management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other short-term assets. See the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management section in this Report for additional information on liquidity and interest rate risk. 
 The AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions and highly rated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). 
 The HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Debt securities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase or when transferred from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Our intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual cash flows. In January 2023, we changed our intent with respect to HTM debt securities with an amortized cost of 23.9 billion and reclassified them to AFS in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional information, see the Current Accounting Developments section in this Report. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2021. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities were more than offset by portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales. In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities with a fair value of 50.1 billion to HTM debt securities in 2022 due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to HTM in 2022 had 4.5 billion of pre-tax unrealized losses at the time of the transfers. 
 The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt securities at December 31, 2022, were driven by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. 
 At December 31, 2022, 99 of the combined AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on external ratings where available and, where not available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by security type.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
 Table 11 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from December 31, 2021, predominantly due to an increase in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns. Consumer loans increased from 

December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in the residential mortgage portfolio due to loan originations, partially offset by loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), which predominantly related to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods.

 Deposits 
 Deposits decreased from December 31, 2021, reflecting: 
 customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives; 
 increased consumer spending; and 
 the transition of deposits related to divested businesses; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher time deposits driven by issuances of certificates of deposit (CDs). 

Table 13 provides additional information regarding deposit balances. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided in the Earnings Performance Net Interest Income section and Table 3 earlier in this Report. In response to rising interest rates in 2022, our average deposit cost in fourth quarter 2022 increased to 0.46 , compared with 0.02 in fourth quarter 2021.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits, or are otherwise uninsured, were estimated to be 510 billion and 590 billion, respectively. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits reflect amounts disclosed in the U.S. regulatory reports of our subsidiary banks, with adjustments for 

amounts related to consolidated subsidiaries. All non-U.S. deposits are treated for these purposes as uninsured. 
 Table 14 presents the contractual maturities of estimated time deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits, or are otherwise uninsured. All non-U.S. time deposits are uninsured.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 
 
 Unfunded Credit Commitments 
 Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
 Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
 We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Derivatives 
 We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Wells Fargo Company 27 

Risk Management 
 Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. 
 
 Risk is Part of our Business Model. Risk is the possibility of an event occurring that could adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model risks, and strategic and reputation risks. 
 
 Risk Profile. The Company s risk profile is an assessment of the aggregate risks associated with the Company s exposures and business activities after taking into consideration risk management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. 
 
 Risk Capacity. Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that the Company could assume given its current level of resources before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital and liquidity needs. 
 
 Risk Appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk capacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current level of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the Company s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. 
 
 Risk and Strategy. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the Company s strategic planning process, which identifies the Company s most significant opportunities and challenges, develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and trade-offs of each. The Company s risk profile, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with the Company s capital planning process. The Company s Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM s evaluation. 
 
 Risk and Climate Change. The Company is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. 

Risk is Managed by Everyone. Every employee, in the course of their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, including establishing and maintaining the Company s control environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. 
 
 Risk and Culture. Senior management sets the tone at the top by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company s expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak up when they see something that could cause harm to the Company s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, 
 or reputation. Because risk management is everyone s responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company s performance management and incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the Company s performance management and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central component of employee performance evaluations. 
 
 Risk Management Framework. The Company s risk management framework sets forth the Company s core principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by the Board s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. 
 
 Wells Fargo s top priority is to strengthen our company by building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, including operational and compliance risk management programs as required by the FRB s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC s April 20, 2018, consent orders. 
 Risk Governance 
 Role of the Board. The Board oversees the Company s business, including its risk management. It assesses senior management s performance and holds senior management accountable for maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management program. 
 
 Board Committee Structure. The Board carries out its risk oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company s risk management framework and oversees management s implementation of the framework, including how the Company manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the Company s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee and administratively to the CEO. 

28 
 Wells Fargo Company 

Management Committee Structure. The Company has established management committees, including those focused on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance and risk management responsibilities. One type of management committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-making body that operates for a particular purpose and may report to a Board committee. 
 Each management governance committee, in accordance with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging 

risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues as appropriate. 
 Table 15 presents, as of December 31, 2022, the structure of the Company s Board committees and escalation paths of relevant management governance committees reporting to a Board committee.

 (1) The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
 Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk Committee of the Board. The Enterprise Risk Control Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to the Company s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management regarding current and emerging risks and senior management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s risk management program. 
 The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its membership is comprised of principal line of business and certain enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with the Company s escalation management policy. 
 Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a risk and control committee, which is a management governance committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its scope limited to the respective principal line of business or 

enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. 
 As a complement to these risk and control committees, management governance committees dedicated to specific risk types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more comprehensive governance of risks. 
 
 Risk Operating Model Roles and Responsibilities 
 The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. 
 Front Line The Front Line, which comprises principal line of business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated by or associated with its business activities and balances risk and reward in decision making while operating within the Company s risk appetite. 
 Independent Risk Management IRM is the second line of defense. It establishes and maintains the Company s risk management program and provides oversight, including 

Wells Fargo Company 29 

Risk Management continued 

 challenge to and independent assessment of, the Front Line s execution of its risk management responsibilities. 
 Internal Audit Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is responsible for acting as an independent assurance function and validates that the risk management program is adequately designed and functioning effectively. 
 Risk Type Classifications 
 The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, including emerging risk exposures. 
 
 Operational Risk Management 
 Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
 The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the Company s business resiliency and disaster recovery, change management, data management, information security, technology, and third-party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant operational risk policies and oversees the Company s operational risk management program. 
 At the management level, Operational Risk Management, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the Board s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management s oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and third-party risk. 
 Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the Company s information security risk management and cyber defense programs. The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for information security risk and approves the Company s information security program, which includes the information security policy and the cyber defense program. 
 Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 

from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. See the Risk Factors section in this Report for additional information regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks. 
 Compliance Risk Management 
 Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately address associated impact, including to customers. Compliance risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, program requirements, procedures, and standards related to ethical principles applicable to the Company. 
 The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs and oversees the Company s compliance risk management and financial crimes risk management programs. 
 Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the Company s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for conduct risk and risk management components of the Company s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board s Human Resources Committee include oversight of the Company s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
 human capital management (including talent management and succession planning), performance management program, and incentive compensation risk management program. 
 At the management level, the Compliance function, which is part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company s compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to compliance risk to the Board s Risk Committee. 
 Model Risk Management 
 Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the potential for adverse consequences of decisions made based on model output that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 
 The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board s Risk Committee oversees the Company s model risk management policy, model governance, model performance, model issue remediation status, and adherence to model risk appetite metrics. 
 At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the Board s Risk Committee. 

30 
 Wells Fargo Company 

Strategic Risk Management 
 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the external operating environment. 
 The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic planning and oversees management s development and implementation of and approves the Company s strategic plan, and considers whether it is aligned with the Company s risk appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management develops, executes and recommends significant strategic corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management s proposals, including their impact on the Company s risk profile and financial position. The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for the Company s strategic risk and the adequacy of the Company s strategic risk management program, including associated risk management practices, processes and controls. The Board s Risk Committee also receives updates from management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks related to new or changing products, as appropriate. 
 At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk provided to the Board s Risk Committee. 
 Reputation Risk Management 
 Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the Company s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. Key stakeholders include customers, employees, communities, shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and media organizations. 
 The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board s Risk Committee receives reports from management that help it monitor how effectively the Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the Board s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the Company. 
 At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation risk provided to the Board s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
 We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of the Company s assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the Board s Risk Committee or its Credit Subcommittee. 
 
 Loan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 16 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable. 
 
 Table 16: Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and Class of Financing Receivable

 We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
 Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
 Counterparty credit risk; 
 Economic and market conditions; 
 Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
 Changes in interest rates; 
 Merger and acquisition activities; and 
 Reputation risk. 
 
 In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its credit risk management activities. 
 Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process. 
 A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

 Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews Measuring and monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
 For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories. 
 We had 12.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2022, compared with 13.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline was driven by decreases in the technology, telecom and media, real estate and construction, and oil, gas and pipelines industries, as these industries continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the materials and commodities, and equipment, machinery and parts manufacturing industries. 
 The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. 
 The portfolio increased at December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, driven by higher loan demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns. Table 18 provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based on the North American Industry Classification System.

 Table 18a provides further loan segmentation for our largest industry category, financials except banks. This category includes loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to 

help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

 (4) Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by commercial or residential real estate loans. 
 (5) Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by consumer loans such as auto loans and leases, and credit cards. 
 Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio also included non-U.S. loans of 79.7 billion and 78.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included: 
 45.7 billion and 46.7 billion in the financials except banks industry; 
 14.1 billion and 15.9 billion in the banks industry; and 
 1.2 billion and 1.7 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines industry. 

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and our assessment of the borrower s ability to perform under the agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 

Wells Fargo Company 33 

Risk Management Credit Risk Management (continued) 

repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 
 Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly related to the guarantor s creditworthiness, capacity and willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the most current financial information available and is focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor s reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us based on our analysis as well as other lenders experience with the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor s credit strength is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance for credit losses methodology. 
 In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate 
 the collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the 
 strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE) Our CRE loan portfolio is comprised of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had 11.3 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with 13.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and 1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with 1.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in criticized CRE loans was driven by the hotel/motel and shopping center property types, as these property types continued to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office buildings and apartment property types. Criticized CRE loans at December 31, 2022, increased compared with September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the office buildings property type. The credit quality of the office buildings property type could continue to be adversely affected if weakened demand for office space continues to drive higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. At December 31, 2022, nearly one-third of the CRE loans in the office buildings property type had recourse to a guarantor, typically through a repayment guarantee, in addition to the related collateral. 

The total CRE loan portfolio increased 8.0 billion from December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in loans for apartments and industrial/warehouse property types, partially offset by a decrease in loans for the shopping center property type. The CRE loan portfolio included 7.6 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at December 31, 2022, down from 8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which represented a combined 49 of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are apartments at 26 and office buildings at 23 of the portfolio. The unfunded credit commitments were 8.8 billion and 11.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and 20.7 billion and 20.0 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans.

 NON-U.S. LOANS Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on whether the borrower s primary address is outside of the United States. At December 31, 2022, non-U.S. loans totaled 87.5 billion, representing approximately 9 of our total consolidated loans outstanding, compared with 86.9 billion, or approximately 10 of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2021. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 5 and 4 of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE Our country risk monitoring process incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure limits for each country through a centralized oversight process based on customer needs, and through consideration of the relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on our assessment of the borrower s ability to repay, 

which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the reporting based on the borrower s primary address. 
 Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at December 31, 2022, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 33.2 billion, or approximately 2 of our total assets, and included 5.5 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. 
 Table 20 provides information regarding our top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to Table 20: 
 Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements, if any.

 RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of 1 4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans. Residential mortgage first lien loans comprised 95 of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, compared with 94 at December 31, 2021. 
 The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans were 7 of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2022. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 
 The residential mortgage junior lien portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent. 
 The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of credit was 18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled 35.5 billion at December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit 

(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5 of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2022, a significant portion of the lines of credit in a draw period used the interest-only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were approximately 2 and 3 of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 During the draw period, the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect some borrowers ability to repay the outstanding balance. 
 In anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit borrowers reaching the end of their draw period, we have created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy.

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional information regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions 

such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after successful completion and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the start of the trial period or at the time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of delinquencies. For additional information on customer accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Residential Mortgage First Lien Portfolio Our residential mortgage first lien portfolio increased 13.5 billion from 
 December 31, 2021, driven by originations, partially offset by loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), which predominantly related to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS) We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
 the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
 they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; 
 part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 
 for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien delinquency status. 

Certain nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status after they perform for a period of time. Consumer credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. 
 Customer payment deferral activities in the residential mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of nonaccrual loans for those residential mortgage customers who would have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For additional information on customer accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see

 (1) Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
 (2) Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased 553 million from December 31, 2021, due to improved credit quality across our commercial loan portfolios.

Table 25 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.

 We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors at December 31, 2022: 
 97 of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, the majority of which are secured by real estate. 
 81 of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and 77 of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of interest or principal had become uncertain. 

99 of total consumer nonaccrual loans are secured, of which 95 are secured by real estate and 98 have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80 or less. 
 588 million of the 743 million of consumer loans in bankruptcy or discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, were current.

As part of our actions to support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended certain residential mortgage foreclosure activities through December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, we resumed these mortgage foreclosure activities. For additional information on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) Table 27 provides information regarding the recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by a decrease in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in trial modifications. The decrease in residential mortgage loans was due to paydowns and transfers to LHFS, which related to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. In January 2023, we adopted a new 

accounting standard that eliminates the accounting and reporting guidance for TDRs. For additional information, see the Current Accounting Developments section in this Report. 
 The amount of our TDRs at December 31, 2022, would have otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency Statement). Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual loan payments upon exiting from these deferral programs may require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to receive modifications, which may be classified as TDRs. For additional information on customer accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan types when a restructuring is involved. We may re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other factors. Loans that are not re-underwritten or loans that lack sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the modified agreement will not be collectible. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information regarding TDRs.

Table 28 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 

sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

 (1) Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 
 The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in 2022, compared with 2021, was driven by lower losses in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios. 
 The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in 2022, compared with 2021, was predominantly due to higher losses in our auto portfolio, driven by loans originated in 2021. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment deferral activities in our residential mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of residential mortgage loan charge-offs. For additional information on customer accommodations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management s estimate of the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional information on our ACL, see the Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see 
 Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional information on our ACL for debt securities, see Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for loans presented in Table 30 may fluctuate from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of collateral. 
 The ACL for loans decreased 179 million, or 1 , from December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans at December 31, 2022. The base scenario assumed elevated inflation and economic contraction in the near term, reflecting increased unemployment rates from historically low levels. The downside scenarios assumed a more substantial economic contraction due to high inflation, declining property values, and lower business and consumer confidence. 
 Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent the risk of limitations inherent in our processes and assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 
 The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate of the ACL for loans at December 31 and September 30, 2022, are presented in Table 31.

We believe the ACL for loans of 13.6 billion at December 31, 2022, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, 
 it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. 
 In connection with our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations and warranties that reflect management s estimate of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 
 We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our exposure to loss related to these programs. 
 In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 
 The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 

taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. 
 In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances were 9.8 billion and 17.3 billion, respectively, which included 8.6 billion and 12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. 
 Repurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the securitization market. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. 
 Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. For additional information on certain consent orders applicable to the Company, see the Overview section in this Report.

Asset/Liability Management 
 Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
 Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. 
 At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to the Board s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk. 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the Company s asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
 assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
 assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts; 
 short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently; 
 the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or 
 interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments. 
 We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. 
 Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 32, estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 0.00 . The following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 32: 
 Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities. 
 Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 

Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. 
 Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income. 
 The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. 
 We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios. 
 Table 32: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months Using Instantaneous Movements 
 in billions) Dec 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2021 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in interest rates 2.3 7.1 -100 bps shift in interest rates (1.7) (3.3) Steeper yield curve: (1) +100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 0.8 n/a -100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.0) n/a +50 bps shift in long-term interest rates 0.4 1.2 -50 bps shift in short-term interest rates (0.5) (0.9) Flatter yield curve: (1) +100 bps shift in short-term interest rates 1.5 n/a -100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (0.7) n/a +50 bps shift in short-term interest rates 0.7 2.6 -50 bps shift in long-term interest rates (0.4) (1.0) 
 (1) In fourth quarter 2022, given the higher levels of interest rates and volatility, we presented 100 bps shifts in our steeper and flatter scenarios. 
 The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, in Table 32 reflected updates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance sheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. For the December 31, 2021, simulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00 interest rate floor limited the amount of the decline in net interest income. 
 The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk section in this Report for additional information. 
 Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees 

46 
 Wells Fargo Company 

on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
 to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
 to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 
 In 2022, we entered into interest rate swap hedges to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio. Additionally, we entered into interest rate swaps to convert the interest cash flows of some floating-rate assets, such as commercial loans and certain interest-earning deposits with banks, to fixed-rates. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. 
 Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate locks extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. 
 The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly subjective and involve complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in 

interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the Critical Accounting Policies Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights section in this Report for additional information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. 
 An increase in interest rates generally reduces the propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. 
 To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged. 
 The size of the hedge and the particular combination of hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. 
 For additional information on mortgage banking, including key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge effectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair value, and impairment of private equity investments. 
 The Board s Finance Committee has primary oversight responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company s market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. 
 In addition, the Board s Risk Committee has certain oversight responsibilities with respect to market risk, including counterparty risk. The Finance Committee reports key market risk matters to the Risk Committee. 
 At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market 

Wells Fargo Company 47 

Risk Management Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

 and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into Corporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic reports related to market risk to the Board s Finance Committee. 
 
 MARKET RISK TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 

function aggregates and monitors exposures against our established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity. 
 Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the market risk exhibited by the Company s trading positions. The Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 Table 33 shows the Company s Trading General VaR by risk category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation model which assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the potential future outcomes and measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 
 1-day time interval at a 99 confidence level. Our historical simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 
 12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 
 12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company s VaR is responsive to current market conditions. The 99 confidence level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on average once every 100 trading days. 
 Average Company Trading General VaR was 35 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 49 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. 

Table 33: Trading 1-Day 99 General VaR by Risk Category 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Period end Average Low High Period end Average Low High Company Trading General VaR Risk Categories

 39 35 20 49 
 (1) The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days. 
 Sensitivity Analysis Given the inherent limitations of the VaR models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01 increase in interest rates or a 1 increase in equity prices. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves. 
 
 Stress Testing While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress testing is designed to capture the Company s exposure to extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios 

estimate the risk of losses based on management s assumptions of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 
 An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. Typical examples include a 1 (100 basis point) increase across the yield curve or a 10 decline in equity market indexes. Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress 

48 
 Wells Fargo Company 

scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis addresses how these events might affect the risk factors relevant to a portfolio. 
 The Company s stress testing framework is also used in calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail on the CCAR process, see the Capital Management section in this Report. 
 
 MARKET RISK EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. These private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews business developments, key risks and historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and the measurement alternative. 
 As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks. 
 
 LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and equipment, and other cash commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or market stress. For additional information on these obligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in this Report: 

Unfunded Credit Commitments section within Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 5) 
 Leasing Activity (Note 8) 
 Deposits (Note 9) 
 Long-Term Debt (Note 10) 
 Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 17) 
 Employee Benefits (Note 21) 
 Income Taxes (Note 22) 
 To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. 
 Liquidity Stress Tests Liquidity stress tests are performed to help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the Company s projected liquidity position during stress and inform future needs in the Company s funding plan. 
 
 Contingency Funding Plan Our contingency funding plan (CFP), which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board s Risk Committee, sets out the Company s strategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the processes for communicating and managing stress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a period of stress. 
 
 Liquidity Standards We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of 10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as Wells Fargo. 
 The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of 10 billion or more. As of December 31, 2022, we were compliant with the NSFR requirement.

 Liquidity Coverage Ratio As of December 31, 2022, the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100 . 
 Table 34 presents the Company s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant 

to the LCR rule requirements. The LCR represents average HQLA divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule.

 (1) Excludes excess HQLA at certain subsidiaries that are not transferable to other Wells Fargo entities. 
 (2) Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule. 
 (3) Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors including the type of customer and the nature of the account. 
 Liquidity Sources We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, interest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in Table 35 at fair value, which also includes encumbered securities that are not included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

 In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
 Table 35, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt securities as well as through the sale, securitization or financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not encumbered. 
 
 Funding Sources The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. WFC Holdings, LLC (the IHC is an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional information on the IHC, see the Regulatory Matters Living Will Requirements and Related Matters section in this Report. Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 145 and 166 of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 209.0 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Although available, we do not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Table 36 presents a summary of our short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. For additional information on the classification of our short-term borrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. We pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For additional information, see the Pledged Assets section of Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 We access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate purposes unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, and we expect the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the same purposes. Depending on market conditions and our 

liquidity position, we may redeem or repurchase, and subsequently retire, our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise. 
 Table 37 presents a summary of our long-term debt. For additional information on our long-term debt, including contractual maturities, see Note 10 (Long-Term Debt), and for information on the classification of our long-term debt, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 Credit Ratings Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well as other market participants, generally will consider, among other factors, a company s debt rating in making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 
 There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2022. 

See the Risk Factors section in this Report for additional information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations as well as Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. 
 The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as of December 31, 2022, are presented in Table 38.

Capital Management 
 We have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the Company s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at December 31, 2022, increased 7.3 billion from December 31, 2021, predominantly as a result of 13.2 billion of Wells Fargo net income, partially offset by 5.4 billion of common and preferred stock dividends. During 2022, we issued 1.8 billion of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2022, we repurchased 110 million shares of common stock at a cost of 6 billion. In 2022, our AOCI decreased 11.7 billion, predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our risk-based capital. For additional information about capital planning, see the Capital Planning and Stress Testing section below. 
 In 2022, we redeemed 609 million of preferred stock. For additional information, see Note 11 (Preferred Stock) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 
 
 RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 39 and Table 40 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 

Table 39: Risk-Based Capital Requirements Standardized Approach as of December 31, 2022 
 
 Table 40: Risk-Based Capital Requirements Advanced Approach as of December 31, 2022 
 
 In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described in Table 39 and Table 40, if the FRB determines that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50 could be added to the risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, 2022, was 0.00 . 
 The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress. 

52 
 Wells Fargo Company 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a BHC s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the FRB s annual supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is 3.20 . 
 As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also subject to the FRB s rule implementing an additional capital surcharge between 1.00-4.50 on the risk-based capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher 
 of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 

wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our 
 G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50 in 2023. 
 Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). 
 The tables that follow provide information about our risk-based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules. Table 41 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, total capital, RWAs and capital ratios.

 (2) Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period-end. 
 (3) In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of the current expected credit loss accounting standard (CECL) on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25 of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25 in year one, 50 in year two and 75 in year three. 
 (4) Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60 of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 1.25 of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
 
 Table 43 provides the composition of our RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

 (1) RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

 TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, which represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company s use of equity. 
 Table 46 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

 LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS As a BHC, we are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 47 presents the leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of December 31, 2022. 
 Table 47: Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00 to be considered well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00 . 
 The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR rules (Proposed SLR rules) that would replace the 2.00 supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR rules would similarly tailor the current 6.00 SLR requirement for our IDIs. 

56 
 Wells Fargo Company 

At December 31, 2022, the Company s SLR was 6.86 , and each of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements. Table 48 presents information regarding the calculation and components of the Company s SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratio.

 (2) Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where Wells Fargo Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
 (3) Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
 (4) The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 
 TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a G-SIB, we are required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of December 31, 2022, are presented in Table 49.

 Under the Proposed SLR rules, the 2.00 external TLAC leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge, and the leverage 

component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt would be modified from 4.50 of total leverage exposure to 2.50 of total leverage exposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge.

 OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS For information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR and NSFR, see the Risk Management Asset/ Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Standards section in this Report. 
 Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022, these broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 
 Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
 Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business, satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our long-term target capital levels are set above their respective regulatory minimums plus buffers. 
 The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs when evaluating their capital plans. 
 As part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Compan y s p roposed capital actions . 
 Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

 Securities Repurchases 
 From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB s capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 

amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any time. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had remaining Board authority to repurchase approximately 250 million shares, subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about share repurchases during fourth quarter 2022, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Matters 
 The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives.

The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC s safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for effective senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to 

the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks. 
 Regulation of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and are protected from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of the financial services industry with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto finance. 
 Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities . The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities. 
 
 Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements 
 The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified

 Wells Fargo Company 

leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see the Capital Management and Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Standards sections in this Report. 
 
 Living Will Requirements and Related Matters 
 Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as living wills, that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. In addition to the Company s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank ), is also required to prepare and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. On November 23, 2022, the FRB and FDIC announced that the Company s most recent resolution plan did not have any shortcomings or deficiencies. 
 If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the orderly liquidation authority. The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors claims. 
 The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 

desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible. 
 To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution. In response to the regulators guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the Support Agreement ), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the IHC ), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC WFS ), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC WFCS ), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the Covered Entities or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the Related Support Entities ). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. 
 In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and 

Wells Fargo Company 59 

Regulatory Matters (continued) 

 periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. 
 
 Other Regulatory Related Matters 
 Regulatory actions. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices, and include the following: 
 Consent Orders Discussed in the Overview Section in this Report. For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the Company, see the Overview section in this Report. 
 OCC approval of director and senior executive officer appointments and certain post-termination payments. Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain individuals and employees. 
 Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and businesses. In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect to waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, and providing payment deferrals. Any current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position. 

Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change. Federal and state governments and government agencies have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and potential risks associated with climate change. For example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of climate change on the financial stability of the United States and the identification and management by large banks of climate-related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has proposed rules that would require public companies to disclose certain climate-related information, including greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related targets and goals, and governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes. The approaches taken by various governments and government agencies can vary significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to climate change and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
 the allowance for credit losses; 
 the valuation of residential MSRs; 
 the fair value of financial instruments; 
 income taxes; 
 liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
 goodwill impairment. 
 
 Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and judgments with the Board s Audit Committee. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management s estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 
 Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considerations include the evaluation of past events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. 
 Judgment is specifically applied in: 
 Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period. We forecast a wide range of economic variables to estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, 

and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the peri od to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. 
 Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. 
 Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities. Individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrower s financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. 
 Usage of credit loss estimation models. We use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are independently validated in accordance with the Company s policies. We routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against the company-wide risk inventory to help appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed. 
 Valuation of collateral . The current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously written-down below current recovery value. 
 Contractual term considerations. The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 

Wells Fargo Company 61 

Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

 options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. 
 Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. These amounts represent management s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 
 
 Sensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant management judgment. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted economic variables used could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 
 Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management s v iew of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We applied a 100 weight to a more severe downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately 7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. 
 The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 
 
 Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) 
 MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. 
 We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are reflected in earnings. 
 We use a model to estimate the fair value of our residential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and require judgment to determine. 

If observable market indications do become available, these are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 
 The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future net servicing income. The prepayment rate is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
 The discount rate used to present value estimated future net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility. 
 The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net servicing income. The cost to service loans includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market participant s view for our estimated cost to service and our actual costs may vary from that estimate. 
 
 Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in servicing standards as well as changes in individual state foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value estimate to independent appraisals. 
 For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as certain LHFS, substantially all nonmarketable equity securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments through the application of an accounting method 

62 
 Wells Fargo Company 

such as lower-of-cost-or-fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value, such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-term debt. 
 The accounting requirements for fair value measurements include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. 
 When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that generally use market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when observable market data is limited or not available, fair value estimates are typically determined using internal models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. 
 When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, management judgment is necessary as we make judgments about significant assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of many factors, including market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market participant would require in light of the illiquid market. 
 We continually assess the level and volume of market activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions can change over time, our determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted prices require adjustment, can also change. 
 Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this judgment, we consider available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques 

and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each instrument s fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant to the fair value measurement, the instrument is classified as Level 3.

 Income Taxes 
 We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50 likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet method and deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. 
 The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise 

Wells Fargo Company 63 

Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

 over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court systems when applicable. 
 We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given quarter. 
 See Note 22 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses 
 The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. 
 We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company s accrual for probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding of information currently available related to the legal evaluation and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management. These matters may be in various stages of investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was not considered or was considered remote in anticipated occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 
 The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. 
 See Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by 

regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in market capitalization. 
 We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill impa irment at the reportable operating segment level or one level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using both an income approach and a market approach which are intended to reflect Company pe rformance and expectations as well as external market conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior management and revised as necessary. 
 The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate de rived from the capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity for our reporting units, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the financial markets a nd in our internally generated business projections. 
 The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-tangible book value r atios, to estimate a reporting unit s fair value. The results of the market approach include a control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in the selection of comparable companies and includes those with the most similar business activities. 
 The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2022 assessment. Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in the price of the Company s common stock, and (iii) risks or benefits at the Company level that may not be reflected in the aggregated fair value of the individual reporting units, such as the impacts of a variety of historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters. 
 Based on our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, there was no impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2022. The fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more than 10 , it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation assumptions, particularly related to the financial forecasts of 
 the supporting businesses. The home lending business may experience uncertainty related to the current mortgage origination market and the outcome of planned changes to the business model. The credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances driven by growth from new products. Adverse changes to these forecasts may result in an impairment. Using our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, we would need to 

64 
 Wells Fargo Company 

experience a substantial decrease in forecasted earnings of the Consumer Lending reporting unit or have a significant increase 
 in the discount rate used for the DCF analysis to result in an impairment. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Consumer Lending reporting unit was 7.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
 Declines in our ability to generate revenue, significant increases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions 

from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill impairment of any reporting unit in a future period.

Current Accounting Developments 
 Table 52 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 52: Current Accounting Developments Issued Standards Description and Effective Date Financial statement impact Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): 
 Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 
 The Update, effective January 1, 2023, requires market risk benefits (features of insurance contracts that protect the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk) to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. The Update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023, with retroactive application to prior periods. The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholder s life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and are measured at fair value. At adoption, the effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of our market risk benefits, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, was approximately 325 million as of January 1, 2023. The adjustment increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios. The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately 15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs did not have a material impact upon adoption. ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging Portfolio Layer Method 
 The Update, effective January 1, 2023 (with early adoption permitted), establishes the portfolio layer method, which expands an entity s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. 
 We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders equity was required upon adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. 
 
 Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 days after the adoption date. 
 
 In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of 23.2 billion and amortized cost of 23.9 billion from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale and designated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 20.1 billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method . The transfer of debt securities was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately 566 million of unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale debt securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.

 Description and Effective Date Financial statement impact ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
 The Update, effective January 1, 2023 (with early adoption permitted), eliminates the accounting and reporting for TDRs by creditors and introduces new required disclosures for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Update also amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. 
 We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023. The Update will impact the measurement of the ACL for loans and require new enhanced disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality, specifically the Update: 
 Eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the ACL for TDRs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans. On January 1, 2023, we removed the interest concession component recognized in the ACL for TDRs using a DCF approach. The cumulative effect adjustment reflected the difference between the pre-modification and post-modification effective interest rates, which would have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans as interest income. The adjustment was a reduction to the ACL for loans of approximately 430 million, and an increase to retained earnings of approximately 320 million, after-tax. This adjustment to retained earnings impacts regulatory capital amounts and ratios. 
 
 Eliminates TDR disclosures and requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other than insignificant payment delay, term extension, or a combination of these modifications. 
 
 Requires us to provide current period gross charge-offs by origination date (vintage) in our credit quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures . From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.

Risk Factors 
 An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. 
 ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND LIQUIDITY RISKS 
 Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, and a deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition. We generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, such as the conflict in Ukraine, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. or global economy , could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. 
 A weakening in business or economic conditions, including higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If 

economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our products, including our consumer and commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings. 
 A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, markets and investment banking businesses. For example, because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively affect the performance of products we have provided to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture capital business and trading activities, including through heightened counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global financial markets and economies, including as a result of any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenue and earnings of our international operations, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent banking services. 
 For additional information, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management and Credit Risk Management sections in this Report. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results and any further impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy; disrupted global supply chains; affected equity market valuations; and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and unemployment levels. As a result of the pandemic, the demand for our products and services has, at times, been significantly impacted, which adversely affected our revenue. The pandemic also resulted in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly for industries most directly and adversely affected by the pandemic, such as travel and entertainment. 
 Moreover, the pandemic created additional operational and compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement and execute new pandemic-related programs and procedures, comply with rapidly changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of our systems, networks, and operations while a larger number of our employees and those of our third-party service providers may spend more time working remotely than prior to the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we previously suspended certain mortgage foreclosure activities and provided fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other assistance for certain consumer and commercial lending customers. Furthermore, our participation in governmental measures taken to address the economic impact from the pandemic could 

Wells Fargo Company 69 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 continue to result in litigation and government investigations and proceedings. In addition, we previously reduced our common stock dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases. The pandemic also increased the likelihood and/or magnitude of the other risks described herein, including credit, market and operational related risks. 
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Depending on future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already experienced. 
 Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, including as a result of recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract. 
 The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023. 
 Changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates could also reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the 

interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with 
 the FRB. 
 We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We also rely on the natural hedge that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based on changes in interest rates. 
 We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or option volatility could reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. 
 Because of changing economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income. As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other financial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
 The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, the prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company 

70 
 Wells Fargo Company 

goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. 
 Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity and venture capital investments that could result in significant OTTI losses for those investments carried under the measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which could be significant. 
 For additional information, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Interest Rate Risk , Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk , Market Risk Trading Activities , and Market Risk Equity Securities and the Balance Sheet Analysis Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities sections in this Report and Note 2 (Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The administrator of LIBOR ceased publication of LIBOR settings on a representative basis on December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, which will no longer be published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. Additionally, federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR in new contracts. We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as legacy commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument. 
 This could impact the financial performance of previously booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and management, or have other adverse financial consequences. There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or other financial metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the transition away from LIBOR will continue to require changes to existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and pricing processes, as well as the modification or renegotiation of contracts that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to result in significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, and heightened expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could result in litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or other market participants challenging the determination of their interest payments, disputing the interpretation or implementation of fallback provisions and other transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the 

extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, our customers ability to repay their loans may be adversely affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance. 
 For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR and the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we have identified, see the Overview Recent Developments LIBOR Transition section in this Report. 
 Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money through capital markets. 
 Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. 
 In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, including any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition.

Risk Factors (continued) 

 As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit balances in order to manage under the asset cap. 
 If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuance of common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or to raise additional capital. 
 For additional information, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management section in this Report. 
 Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies outlooks are based on the ratings agencies analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. 
 For information on our credit ratings, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding Credit Ratings section and for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law, as well as certain contractual arrangements, can limit those dividends. Wells Fargo Company, the parent holding company (the Parent ), is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the IHC ), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank ), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. 
 For additional information, see the Regulation and Supervision Dividend Restrictions and Holding Company Structure sections in our 2022 Form 10-K and to Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 REGULATORY RISKS 
 
 Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position. Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. Economic, market and political conditions during the past few years have led to a significant amount of legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, increase our capital requirements, impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, economic and social developments in 

72 
 Wells Fargo Company 

those jurisdictions, including sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, greater government oversight and scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies generally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences. 
 Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB s rules may continue to increase our compliance costs and require changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities including the products and services we can provide, and/or harm to our reputation. 
 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives activities. 
 We are also subject to various rules and regulations related to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. 
 Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities relating to the privacy of the information of customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a significant impact on our businesses collection, processing, sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for non-compliance. 
 In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent order with the FRB regarding the Board s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company s compliance and operational risk management program. This consent order limits the Company s total consolidated assets as defined under the 

consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding the Company s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. 
 Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain individuals and employees. 
 The Company may be subject to further actions, including the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators regarding similar or other issues. Furthermore, issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which could be significant. For example, in September 2021, the OCC assessed a 250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company s Home Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB consent order, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well as the implementation of their requirements, may continue to increase the Company s costs, require the Company to reallocate resources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the Company to business restrictions, negatively impact the Company s capital and liquidity, and require the Company to undergo significant changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. For additional information on the Company s consent orders, see the Overview section in this Report. 
 Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect our business include proposals to reform the housing finance market in the United States. These proposals, among other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company s business and financial results, are uncertain. 
 Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also could significantly change our regulatory environment and increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial services 

Wells Fargo Company 73 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 
 For additional information on the significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business, see the Regulatory Matters section in this Report and the Regulation and Supervision section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 
 We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or recovery plan is deficient. Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits resolution plans, also known as living wills, designed to facilitate our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the Company s resolution plans. 
 If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. 
 In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any 
 financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. 
 Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the orderly liquidation authority, which allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. The FDIC s orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors claims. 
 The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. 
 To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain 

liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not implemented. 
 Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the Parent, while the Parent s subsidiaries may continue to operate. Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent s security holders could face significant or complete losses. This outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent s security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses than if the strategy had not been implemented. 
 For additional information, see the Regulatory Matters Living Will Requirements and Related Matters section in this Report. 
 
 Bank regulations and rules may require higher capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our business, or provide loans or other products and services to our customers . The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. 
 In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital plan rule that establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and 

74 
 Wells Fargo Company 

imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing financial distress and has proposed additional requirements regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, including its expectations for boards of directors and senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. 
 The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, such as through the adoption or implementation of new or revised Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products and services to our customers. 
 For additional information, see the Capital Management, Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Standards, and Regulatory Matters sections in this Report and the Regulation and Supervision section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 
 FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve which may result from the FRB s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin. 
 CREDIT RISKS 
 
 Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse 

effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. 
 Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. 
 For additional information, see the Risk Management Credit Risk Management and Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses sections in this Report. 
 We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or geography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in such industries to meet their financial obligations. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may 

Wells Fargo Company 75 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. 
 We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. 
 A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 
 Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit performance and results of operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. operations. 
 Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain derivative transactions through central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not sufficiently covered by available collateral. 
 For additional information regarding credit risk, see the Risk Management Credit Risk Management section and 
 Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC AND LEGAL RISKS 
 
 A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. 
 As a large financial institution that serves customers through numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide products and services to our customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, and as cyber and other information security attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there 

have been and could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information security incidents. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant costs, and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover critical business processes or operations that have been disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our customers. 
 As a result of financial institutions and technology systems becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are heightened to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. 
 Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse 

76 
 Wells Fargo Company 

consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 A cyber attack or other information security incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or reputation. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our customers devices continue to be the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo s or our customers confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption of Wells Fargo s or our customers or other third parties business operations. For example, various retailers have reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their customers data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. 
 Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of financial institutions and technology systems, an information security incident at a third party or a third party s downstream service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties (including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer material harm, including business disruptions, losses or remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and software, or as a result of our or our customers data being 

compromised due to information security incidents affecting those third parties. 
 Our risk and exposure to information security threats remains heightened because of, among other things, the persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the investigation of any information security breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, which may further increase any associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses associated with an information security breach. 
 Cyber attacks or other information security incidents affecting us or third parties (including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource operations, or affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest 

Wells Fargo Company 77 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the inability to align performance management and compensation to achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed to risks or losses if we do not accurately or completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other misconduct. 
 In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could result in ineffective risk management practices, business decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our business decisions and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, build and maintain robust risk management policies and practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to retail sales practices and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Various government entities and offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking 

damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Furthermore, we have identified and may in the future identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure. For example, we have identified certain issues related to past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The identification of such areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences. 
 For additional information, see the Overview Retail Sales Practices Matters and Overview Customer Remediation Activities sections and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Similarly, regulators may be more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against us to the extent that we are or have previously been subject to other regulatory actions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to the products and services we may offer or other business activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require us to report transactions and other information to regulators and 

78 
 Wells Fargo Company 

other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately provide regulatory reports, customer notices or disclosures. Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures in place at the time designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, loss of customers, or other negative consequences. 
 Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of our size and profile in the financial services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests with and among our customers; environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses under the Wells Fargo brand, negative public opinion about one business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 

of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. 
 Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking locations, and have been subject to negative public commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial services to or making investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 If we are unable to develop and execute effective business plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive standing and results of operations could suffer. In order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business plans or strategies related to, among other things, our organizational structure, our compliance and risk management framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require significant financial, technological, management and other resources, may divert management attention and resources away from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are unable to develop or execute effective business plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. 
 Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 

Wells Fargo Company 79 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the acquired company or business operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations and/or employees. 
 Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change. The physical effects of climate change, including the increased prevalence and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could require us to change certain of our business and/or risk management practices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and business. Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is disliked, disfavored, or perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. For additional information on regulatory developments in response to climate change, see the Regulatory Matters section in this Report. 
 We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences from legal actions. Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a 

legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition to imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business restrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. 
 For additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS 
 
 Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new mortgage loans. We earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a natural hedge, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. 
 We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. 
 We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company s business and financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or government insuring agencies standards, which are generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans.

 We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service. For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. 
 Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we originate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects management s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of the liability depends on economic factors and other external conditions, the level of the liability is difficult to estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase liability. 
 Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for the mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing income. 
 We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other adverse consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, including with respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing income and the fair value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. We may also face risks, including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of residential mortgage loans we service.

(Legal Actions) and Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 COMPETITIVE RISKS 
 We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers needs and preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customer relationships and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Continued technological advances and the growth of 
 e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, and/or develop new products and services to respond to our customers needs and preferences. To the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new products and services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects. The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, capital markets, risk management and technology, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract 

Wells Fargo Company 81 

Risk Factors (continued) 

 and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, effectively manage employee performance and development, and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior leadership positions, our business performance, competitive position and future prospects may be adversely affected. 
 FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 
 
 Changes in accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect our financial results and condition. From time to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also materially affect our financial statements. For additional information, see the Current Accounting Developments section in this Report. 
 
 Our financial statements require certain assumptions and estimates and rely on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, among other items, in determining the allowance for credit losses, the liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, derivative assets and liabilities, and equity securities. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial results are incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see the Critical Accounting Policies section in this Report. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires our management to evaluate the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any material weaknesses in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. We could also be required to devote significant resources to remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences. 

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2023 for material changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could adversely affect our financial results and condition.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2022, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during fourth quarter 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth below and should be read with these limitations 
 in mind. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s financial statements included in this Annual Report, issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG s audit report appears on the following page.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the following key components: 
 An initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects management s expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by management to estimate future credit losses. 
 Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast period. These long-term averages are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. 

The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a TDR. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating the application of future payments to the outstanding loan amount. 
 Utilization of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring, unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of the collateral. The DCF methods obtain estimated life-time credit losses using the initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described above. 
 For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the

 Credit Quality 
 We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for debt securities. The credit quality indicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings and delinquency status and are based on information as of our financial statement date. 
 CREDIT RATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market 

participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 (4) Includes non-U.S. government, non-agency mortgage-backed, and all other debt securities. 
 DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES Debt security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of principal or interest payments and whether any securities have been placed into nonaccrual status. 
 Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in nonaccrual status were insignificant at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Purchased debt securities with credit deterioration (PCD) are not considered to be in nonaccrual status, as payments from issuers of these securities remain current. PCD securities were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows to the debt securities amortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for debt securities. 

For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing debt securities for impairment as well as methodology and significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We have various classes of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan portfolio segment. 
 Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is provided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified in a TDR. 
 We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores 
 are generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. 

million or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs and CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions.

billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not consider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In addition, COVID-19-related modifications are generally not classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement. For additional information on the TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report. 
 We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned permanent modification, to determine if they can perform according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not considered modified and they continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. 
 Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR amounted to million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 (2) Other concessions include loans with payment (principal and/or interest) deferral, loans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the contractual interest rate. The reported amounts include loans that are new TDRs that may have COVID-19-related payment deferrals and exclude COVID-19-related payment deferrals on loans previously reported as TDRs given limited current financial effects other than payment deferral. 
 (3) Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. 
 (4) Recorded investment related to interest rate reduction reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans reported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 
 (5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the current period.

Director Awards 
 We granted common stock awards to non-employee directors elected or re-elected at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 26, 2022. These stock awards vest immediately. 
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 The Wells Fargo Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution plan with an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) feature. We have previously loaned money to the 401(k) Plan to purchase ESOP Preferred Stock that was convertible into common stock over time as the loans were repaid. The Company s annual contribution to the 401(k) Plan, as well as dividends received on unreleased shares, are used to make payments on the loans. As the loans are repaid, shares are released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan. 
 In October 2022, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our ESOP Preferred Stock in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock. For additional information see Note 11 (Preferred Stock). 
 Shares that are not yet released are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as unearned ESOP shares. Released common stock is allocated to the 401(k) Plan participants and invested in the Wells Fargo ESOP Fund within the 401(k) Plan. Dividends on the allocated common shares reduce retained earnings, and the shares are considered outstanding for computing earnings per share. Dividends on the unreleased common stock or ESOP Preferred Stock do not reduce retained earnings, and the unreleased shares are not considered to be common stock equivalents for computing earnings per share.

billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related information in the Company s public disclosures. In January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court approval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay million to resolve this action. In addition, the Company was subject to a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that customers were entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement to resolve the class action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District 

Court for the Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, including related insurance products. On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. The consent order requires, among other things, remediation to customers and the payment of a billion civil penalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state attorneys general. 
 COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION In October and November 2020, plaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud class actions, which were consolidated into lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made false and misleading statements or omissions regarding, among other things, the Company s commercial lending underwriting practices, the credit quality of its commercial credit portfolios, and the value of its commercial loans, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In May 2022, the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 2023, the parties voluntarily dismissed the appeal. 
 COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, including the United States Department of Labor (Department of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve the Department of Labor s review. On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company s 401(k) plan filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain of these transactions. 
 CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo shareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors made false or misleading statements regarding the Company s efforts to comply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC. Allegations related to the Company s efforts to comply with these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. 
 CONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS The CFPB has undertaken an investigation into whether customers were unduly harmed by the Company s historical practices associated with the freezing (and, in many cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company

 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 

New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately billion, which includes approximately billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and million in additional funding. The Company s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled while others remain pending. 
 MORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS Plaintiffs representing a class of mortgage borrowers filed separate putative class actions alleging that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys fees that were included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or repayment plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into settlements to resolve the class actions, while the others were voluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and other mortgage servicing matters. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a million civil money penalty against the Company regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company s Home Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC s April 2018 consent order. In addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. As described above, on December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB s investigations related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. 
 
 NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION In August 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit Capital Inc. (Nomura) and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo entered into an agreement to settle the actions filed by Nomura, and the actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of its

, the Company entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice s criminal investigation into the Company s retail sales practices as well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of Justice s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. On , the Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC s investigation arising out of the Company s retail sales practices. As part of the resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments totaling billion. The Company has also entered into agreements to resolve other government agency investigations, including investigations by the state attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into various settlements to resolve these lawsuits. 
 RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential 

class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. 
 SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. 
 Wells Fargo filed a petition to remove the case to federal court, but the case was remanded back to state court. 
 
 OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately billion as of December 31, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo s results of operations for any particular period.

 Balance Sheet Offsetting 
 We execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under master netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative balances on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 For disclosure purposes, we present Total Derivatives, net which represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral.

Counterparty valuation adjustments related to derivative assets were million and million and debit valuation adjustments related to derivative liabilities were million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were primarily related to interest rate contracts. 
 Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
 For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical commodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 24 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. 

For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial loans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 We estimate million pre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow hedges in OCI at December 31, 2022, will be reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022, we are hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of years. For additional information on our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).

 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer accommodation trading purposes. 
 We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and credit risk. We also use economic hedge derivatives to mitigate the periodic earnings volatility caused by mismatches between the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging instrument recognized on our fair value accounting hedges. 
 Changes in the fair values of derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred compensation plan are reported in personnel expense. 
 
 Mortgage Banking Activities 
 We use economic hedge derivatives in our mortgage banking business to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of (1) certain residential MSRs measured at fair value, (2) residential mortgage LHFS, (3) derivative loan commitments, and (4) other interests held. The types of derivatives used include swaps, swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and options contracts. Loan commitments for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered derivatives. Residential MSRs, derivative loan commitments, certain residential mortgage LHFS, and our economic hedge derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in mortgage banking noninterest income. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information on this economic hedging activity and mortgage banking income. 

Customer Accommodation Trading and Other 
 For customer accommodation trading purposes, we use swaps, futures, forwards, spots and options to assist our customers in managing their own risks, including interest rate, commodity, equity, foreign exchange, and credit contracts. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. 
 Customer accommodation trading and other derivatives also include embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and certificates of deposit (CDs) where the performance of the hybrid instrument note is linked to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an embedded derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded derivative from the host contract and account for the host contract and derivative separately.

 Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was million and million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. 
 
 NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. 
 
 WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.

 In the normal course of business, we purchase certain 
 non-agency securities at initial securitization or subsequently in the secondary market, which we hold for investment. We also provide seller financing in the form of loans. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received 
 cash flows of million, million, and million, respectively, related to principal and interest payments on these securities and loans, which exclude cash flows related to trading activities and to the sale of our student loan portfolio.

 SALE OF STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO In the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold billion of student loans, servicing-released. For the same period, we received billion in proceeds from the sales and recognized million of gains, which are included in other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of income. In connection with the sales, we provided billion of collateralized loan financing to a third-party sponsored VIE, and received cash flows of billion which fully repaid these loans. We do not consolidate the VIE as we do not have power over the significant activities of the entity. 

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. We transferred billion, billion, and billion of securities to resecuritization VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are not included in Table 16.1. Related total VIE assets were billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held million and million of securities, respectively, of which million and million related to resecuritizations transacted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
 MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS Table 16.4 includes nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we originate and transfer the loans to the unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional information about these VIEs, see the Loan Sales and Securitization Activity section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by third parties where we did not originate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and invest in securities that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 
 Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 16.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over the activities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the Loan Sales and Securitization Activity and Resecuritization Activities sections within this Note. 
 
 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased industrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. 
 
 OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations collateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral may include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student loans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.

 INVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES In addition to the unconsolidated VIEs in Table 16.4, we may invest in or provide funding to affordable housing, renewable energy or similar projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits and other tax benefits. The projects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have the power over the VIE s assets, therefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax credit VIEs was billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also had loans to tax credit VIEs with a carrying value of billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Our maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was billion and billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss included total unfunded equity and lending commitments of billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information about unfunded capital commitments. 

Our affordable housing equity investments qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For these investments we are periodically required to provide additional financial support during the investment period, or at the discretion of project sponsors. A liability is recognized for unfunded commitments that are both legally binding and probable of funding. These commitments are predominantly funded within of initial investment. Our liability for affordable housing equity investment unfunded commitments was billion at December 31, 2022, and billion at December 31, 2021, and was included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.

 (3) In 2022, we changed our presentation for maximum exposure to loss for these guarantees. As the agreements that include these guarantees automatically renew annually, we believe presentation of these amounts within the expires in one year or less category better aligns with the committed term. 
 (4) Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Estimated maximum exposure to loss was million and million with related collateral of billion and billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in 
 Table 17.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. 
 For our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on an external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment grade. 
 
 STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, which include performance and financial guarantees, for customers in connection with contracts between our customers and third parties. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet their contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss includes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. 
 
 DIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue direct pay letters of credit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these 

instruments to make scheduled principal and interest payments, redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. 
 
 WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of written options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of million, and an asset of million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure to loss was billion, with billion expiring in three years or less compared with billion and billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. See Note 14 (Derivatives) for additional information regarding written derivative contracts. 

Wells Fargo Company 163 

Note 17: Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) 

 of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss reported in Table 17.1 represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and warranties. 
 
 EXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES We are members of several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we use to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other members and of the organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these organizations. Some membership rules require members to assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another member s default or from non-member default losses after applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote. 
 
 OTHER GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS We have contingent performance arrangements related to various customer relationships and lease transactions. We are required to pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties default on certain obligations. 
 Under certain factoring arrangements, we may be required to purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable debtors default on their payment obligations. 
 We use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle transactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that could occur for non-performance by our customers on transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations related to the settlement of margin accounts and short positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing transactions. 
 We enter into other types of indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. These 

relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to determine our potential future liability under these agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various representations and warranties. 
 
 MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit card transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in connection with our merchant processing services because most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2022, our potential maximum exposure was approximately billion, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. 
 
 GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related to its subsidiaries obligations. These obligations are included in the Company s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were million and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent s ability to address claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on the Parent s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that subsidiary s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the Parent s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional information regarding other restrictions on the Parent s ability to receive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its

million and million and commitments to purchase equity securities of billion and billion, respectively. 
 As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these obligations are guarantees of other members performance and accordingly are included in Table 17.1 in Other guarantees and indemnifications. 
 We have commitments to enter into resale and securities borrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements was billion and billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements was billion and billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded from Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).

 Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities 
 We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, securities financing activities typically to finance trading positions (including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover short trading positions, accommodate customers financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for these transactions as collateralized financings in which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We believe these financing transactions generally do not have material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements 

involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of our commercial lending business activities.

 REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS Securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements are effectively short-term collateralized borrowings. In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction s maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including (1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, (2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below the amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in various ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our cash repayment.

reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. 
 
 Consumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses with annual sales generally up to million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending. 
 
 Commercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, family owned and certain public companies. Products and services include banking and credit products across multiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease products, and treasury management. 
 
 Corporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital markets, banking, and financial products and services to corporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities. 
 
 Wealth and Investment Management provides personalized wealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, private banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We operate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and digitally through WellsTrade and Intuitive Investor . 

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable operating segments as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to our efficiency initiatives. See Note 20 (Revenue and Expenses) for additional information on restructuring charges. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for previously divested businesses. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 
 
 REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. 
 When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. 
 
 TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company s consolidated financial results.

 billion, billion, and billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included expenses primarily related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters. See Note 13 (Legal Actions) for additional information on accruals for legal actions. 
 
 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Company began pursuing various initiatives to reduce expenses and create a more efficient and streamlined organization in third quarter 2020. Actions from these initiatives included (i) reorganizing and simplifying business processes and structures to improve internal operations and the customer experience, (ii) reducing headcount, (iii) optimizing third-party spending, including for our technology infrastructure, and (iv) rationalizing our branch and administrative locations, which may include consolidations and closures. Substantially all of the restructuring charges were personnel expenses related to severance costs associated with headcount reductions with payments made over time in accordance with our severance plan as well as payments for other employee benefit costs such as incentive compensation. 
 Restructuring charges are recorded as a component of noninterest expense on our consolidated statement of income. Changes in estimates represent adjustments to noninterest expense based on refinements to previously estimated amounts, which may reflect trends such as higher voluntary employee attrition as well as changes in business activities.

new benefits accrue after that date. 
 Prior to July 1, 2009, eligible employees Cash Balance Plan accounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a percentage of their certified compensation; the freeze discontinued the allocation of compensation credits after 
 June 30, 2009. Investment credits continue to be allocated to participants accounts based on their accumulated balances. 
 We did make a contribution to our Cash Balance Plan in 2022. We do not expect that we will be required to make a contribution to the Cash Balance Plan in 2023. For the nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, there is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount needed to fund benefit payments. 
 We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan based on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual service and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of million and million were recognized during 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing the pro rata portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) based on the percentage reduction in the Cash Balance Plan s projected 

benefit obligation attributable to 2022 and 2021 lump sum payments (included in the Benefits paid line in Table 21.1). 
 Additionally, we sponsored the Wells Fargo Canada Corporation Pension Plan to employees in Canada (Canada Pension Plan), a defined benefit retirement plan. In June 2022, an annuity contract was entered into that effected a full settlement of this Canada Pension Plan, resulting in a plan settlement of million and a settlement loss of million. 
 Our nonqualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain eligible employees. The benefits under these plans were frozen in prior years. 
 Other benefits include health care and life insurance benefits provided to certain retired employees. We reserve the right to amend, modify or terminate any of these benefits at any time.

 To account for postretirement health care plans, we used health care cost trend rates to recognize the effect of expected changes in future health care costs due to medical inflation, utilization changes, new technology, regulatory requirements and Medicare cost shifting. In determining the end of year benefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of approximately for health care costs in 2023. This rate is assumed to trend down - per year until the trend rate reaches an ultimate rate of in . The 2022 periodic benefit cost was determined using an initial annual trend rate of . This rate was assumed to decrease - per year until the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of in . 
 
 Investment Strategy and Asset Allocation 
 We seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a prudent level of risk, given the benefit obligations of the pension plans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate amount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset classes and various investment strategies, coupled with an investment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash Balance Plan s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan currently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the following ranges: - fixed income, - equities, and - in real estate, private equity and other investments. The Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several members of senior management, formally reviews the investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/liability evaluations are also conducted. 

Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) trust, which are invested with a target mix of - equities and - fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree Medical Plan Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income securities and cash. Members of the EBRC formally review the investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly basis.

 Effective January 2021, we implemented the following changes to the 401(k) Plan employer contributions: (1) with some exceptions, employees with of service must be employed in a benefit-eligible position on December 15; (2) added a new non-discretionary base contribution of of certified compensation for employees with annual compensation of less than 75,000; (3) replaced the discretionary profit sharing contribution with a discretionary contribution for eligible employees with annual compensation of less than 150,000; and (4) revised the matching contribution vesting and timing. Eligible employees are vested in their base and discretionary contributions after of service. A three-year service vesting requirement for matching contributions applies to employees hired after December 31, 2020. Base and matching contributions are made annually at year-end, and the discretionary contribution, if awarded, is made no later than the due date for the Company s federal income tax return (including extensions) for the plan year. Additionally, we added installment payment options to the existing lump sum and partial lump sum distribution options and added optional advisory services. 
 Prior to January 2021, eligible employees who completed of service were eligible to receive the matching contributions quarterly, which are dollar for dollar up to of certified compensation, and a discretionary profit sharing contribution up to of certified compensation, if awarded, paid following the plan year. Matching contributions were vested, and the discretionary profit sharing contributions required of vesting service (no change).

 We have determined that a valuation allowance is required for 2022 in the amount of million, attributable to deferred tax assets in various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized due to lack of sources of taxable income, limitations on carry back of losses or credits and the inability to implement tax planning to realize these deferred tax assets. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to implement tax planning strategies.

 Of the billion of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, approximately billion would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The remaining billion of unrecognized tax benefits relates to income tax positions on temporary differences. 
 We account for interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have accrued expenses of approximately million and million, respectively, for interest and penalties. In 2022 and 2021, we recognized income tax benefit, net of tax, of million and million, respectively, related to interest and penalties. 
 We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are routinely examined by tax authorities in these various jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries are not subject to federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax examinations for taxable years prior to 2011. It is reasonably possible that one or more of the examinations or appeals may be resolved within the next twelve months resulting in a decrease of up to billion of our gross unrecognized tax benefits.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Wells Fargo Company: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells Fargo Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s ACL as of December 31, 2022 was 13.6 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics utilizing multiple credit loss models. The Company estimated the ACL for commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on individual risk characteristics of the loans and historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company s credit loss models utilize economic variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. A portion of the ACL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. 
 We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 
 188 
 Wells Fargo Company 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. 
 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the ACL estimate, including controls over the: 
 development of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models 
 continued use and appropriateness of changes made to certain credit loss and economic forecasting models 
 performance monitoring of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models 
 identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain credit loss and economic forecasting models 
 development of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of certain qualitative factors 
 analysis of the ACL results, trends, and ratios. 
 We evaluated the Company s process to develop the estimate by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the Company s ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development, assessment and performance testing of certain credit loss models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 
 assessing the conceptual soundness of the credit loss models, including the selection of certain assumptions, by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use 
 evaluating the methodology used to develop the forecasted economic scenarios, the selection of underlying assumptions and the weighting of scenarios by comparing it to the Company s business environment 
 assessing the forecasted economic scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts 
 testing the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods to evaluate the length of each period 
 testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral 
 evaluating the methods and assumptions used to develop certain qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. 
 We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the ACL estimates by evaluating the: 
 cumulative results of the audit procedures 
 qualitative aspects of the Company s accounting practices 
 potential bias in the accounting estimates. 
 Assessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) 
 As discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s residential MSR asset as of December 31, 2022 was 9.3 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of 681 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. 
 We identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the following assumptions because they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing standards. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of residential MSRs, including controls over the: 
 assessment of the valuation model 
 evaluation of the significant assumptions (prepayment rates, discount rates, and cost to service) used in determining the MSR fair value 
 comparison of the MSR fair value to independent appraisals. 
 Wells Fargo Company 189 

We evaluated the Company s process to develop the MSR fair value by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the design of the valuation model used to estimate the MSR fair value in accordance with relevant U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 evaluating significant assumptions based on an analysis of backtesting results and a comparison of significant assumptions to available data for comparable entities and independent appraisals 
 assessing significant assumption updates made during the year by considering backtesting results, external market events, independent appraisals, and other circumstances that a market participant would have expected to be incorporated in the valuation that were not incorporated. 
 
 Assessment of goodwill impairment 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2022 was 25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial forecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The forecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management s expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. 
 
 We identified the assessment of the goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had 7.1 billion of allocated goodwill as of December 31, 2022, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s determination of the estimated fair value of the Consumer Lending reporting unit, including controls related to the: 
 evaluation of the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast assumption and 
 evaluation of the discount rate assumption. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by evaluating historical performance and economic trends. We also evaluated the consistency of the financial forecast assumption by comparing the forecast to other analyses used by the Company and inquiries performed of senior management regarding the strategic plans for the reporting unit, including future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities. We compared historical financial forecasts to actual results to assess the Company s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by comparing certain growth trends for the reporting unit to publicly available data for comparable entities 
 evaluating the discount rate assumption used in the fair value determination by comparing the inputs to the discount rate to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate and 
 evaluating the reasonableness of the total fair value through comparison to the Company s market capitalization and analysis of the resulting premium to applicable market transactions. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 1931.
