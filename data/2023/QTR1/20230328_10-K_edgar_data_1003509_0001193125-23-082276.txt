provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K: Item 1112(b) of Regulation
AB: Significant obligors of pool assets (Financial information). The pool assets held by the American Express Credit Account Master
Trust (the Trust do not include any significant obligors. Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB: Credit enhancement and other support,
except for certain derivatives instruments (Financial information). Based on the standards set forth in Item 1114(b) of
Regulation AB, no information is required in response to this Item. Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB: Certain derivatives instruments (Financial
information). Based on the standards set forth in Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB, no information is required in response to this
Item. Item 1117 of Regulation AB: Legal proceedings. 
 In the ordinary course of business, American Express Company and its subsidiaries American Express are subject to various pending
and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively,
legal proceedings). Based on American Express current knowledge, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities,
American Express does not believe it is a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the
uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on
its results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving American Express are described below. 

On February 25, 2020, American Express was named as a defendant in a case filed in the
Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, captioned Laurelwood Cleaners LLC v. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction in California prohibiting American Express from enforcing its anti-steering
and non-discrimination provisions and from requiring merchants to offer the service of Amex-card acceptance for free. The case has been stayed pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings. 
 On January 29, 2019, American Express was named in a putative class action brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York, captioned Anthony Oliver, et al. v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc., in which the plaintiffs are holders of MasterCard, Visa and/or Discover credit cards (but not
American Express cards) and allege they paid higher prices as a result of American Express anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions in violation of federal antitrust law and the antitrust and
consumer laws of various states. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other forms of relief. The court dismissed plaintiffs federal antitrust claim, numerous state antitrust and consumer protection claims and their unjust enrichment claim.
The remaining claims in plaintiffs complaint arise under the antitrust laws of 11 states and the consumer protection laws of six states. 
 On March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and
others, filed a suit, captioned B R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam s Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al., for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California s Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to
shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint
was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied American Express motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court
transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On August 28, 2020, the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. 
 In July 2004, American Express was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently
transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of American Express charge cards
and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. 
 In May 2020, American Express began responding to a review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of
Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, American Express received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney s Office for
the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Protection Bureau (CFPB) pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January
2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against American Express at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could
result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against American Express seeking fines or other remedial actions. American Express is cooperating with all inquiries.

 Item 1119 of Regulation AB: Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 Information required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report
 on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119. Item 1122 of
Regulation AB: Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. Each of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. TRS (for itself and on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiary, American Express National Bank AENB )), Exela Technologies, Inc. (for itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries) (individually and collectively,
 Exela ), and The Bank of New York Mellon (each, a Servicing Participant has been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the pool assets held by the Trust for all or a
portion of the period covered by this Form 10-K. 

Each of the Servicing Participants has completed a report on an assessment of
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant (each, a Report on Assessment as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which Reports on Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the Servicing Participants has provided an attestation report (each, an Attestation Report by a registered independent public accounting firm
regarding its related Report on Assessment. Each Attestation Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. 
 Exela: Exela s Report on Assessment states that Exela has complied in all material respects with the
applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for the period from June 19, 2022 through June 27, 2022. 
 According to Exela s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on August 12, 2022 (the Exela Form 10-Q ), Exela experienced a network security incident impacting certain of its operational and information technology systems in late June 2022, which caused Exela to take large parts of its network
offline, disrupting some access to its applications and services (the network outage ). As a result of the network outage, paper payment remittances, including Trust remittances representing a limited volume of total Trust remittances,
were not timely processed and recorded by Exela as contemplated by Items 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) of Regulation AB for the nine-day period from June 19, 2022 through June 27, 2022. The interruption of paper payment processing during the
network outage did not impact any investor payments, and the impact of the network outage was limited to the servicing criteria applicable to Exela. In the Exela Form 10-Q, Exela described certain remediation efforts with respect to the network
outage, including its initiation of its response and containment protocols, and efforts to identify, contain and recover from the network outage quickly and securely. We have not independently verified the accuracy of Exela s disclosure or the
adequacy of its remediation efforts. In an effort to reduce its reliance on a single provider of paper payment remittance processing, TRS
has onboarded an additional third party to perform such services. Vendors 
 A Servicing Participant may engage one or more vendors, who are not considered servicers for purposes of Regulation AB, to perform specific and
limited, or scripted activities that address all or a portion of one or more servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant. In general in these cases, the Servicing Participant has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether
such vendors activities comply in all material respects with such servicing criteria, and may elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such vendors activities in such Servicing
Participant s Report on Assessment. 

Where the Servicing Participant has not instituted such policies and procedures, or where
the Servicing Participant does not otherwise elect to take responsibility for assessing its vendors activities, the vendor is itself treated as a Servicing Participant and is required to provide its own Report on Assessment and related
Attestation Report. Platform Level Reports 
 Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that each Servicing Participant complete a Report on Assessment at a
 platform level, meaning that the transactions covered by the Report on Assessment should include all asset-backed securities transactions involving such Servicing Participant that are backed by the same asset type. During 2022, TRS 
proprietary facilities conducted paper payment remittance processing services and performed billing dispute services. Exela (through its wholly owned subsidiary, Regulus West, LLC) also performed paper payment remittance processing services at three
locations in the United States. As a remittance processor, Exela is responsible for, among other services, transmitting payment information to TRS, which TRS in turn uses to update its account obligor records. In its Report on Assessment attached as
Exhibit 33.2 to this Form 10-K, Exela defines its platform to include (i) remittance processing services it provides to customers who are issuers or servicers of asset-backed
securities transactions and (ii) who have requested confirmation of Exela s compliance in connection with loan and/or receivables portfolios that include pool assets for asset backed securities transactions. The Bank of New York Mellon is
Trustee of the Trust. In its Report on Assessment attached as Exhibit 33.3 to this Form 10-K, The Bank of New York Mellon defines its platform to include publicly issued (i.e.,
transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 (and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006), that are subject
to Regulation AB for which The Bank of New York Mellon provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed
securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities. None of TRS or the Trust is an affiliate of Exela or The Bank of New York
Mellon. Item 1123 of Regulation AB: Servicer Compliance Statement. 
 Each of TRS, AENB, and Exela has been identified by the registrant as a servicer or subservicer with respect to the pool assets held by the
Trust for all or a portion of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Each of them has provided a Statement of Compliance for the period covered by this Form
 10-K (a Compliance Statement ), in each case signed by an authorized officer thereof. Each Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH 
 APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA Management of The
Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the
 Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s management has
determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: Platform :
Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB (including transactions
subject to Regulation AB by contractual obligation) for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent or custodial services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential
mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform ). Period : The twelve months ended
December 31, 2022 (the Period ). Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent
required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled Not Applicable to Platform in Appendix 1 attached hereto. 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company s management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by
the servicing criterion. The Company s management has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). The Company s
management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The Company s management is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related servicing criterion. 

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of
compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 2. The Company s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above as of and for the Period. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as
such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) may direct the Trustee (as such term is defined in the related transaction agreements) to file, or cause to be filed, all filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary to maintain the
effectiveness of any original filings identified by the Trustor to be necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee s security interest in or lien on the Underlying Securities (as such term
is defined in the related transaction agreements). As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company was not instructed by any Trustors to perform such activities. Absent the receipt of instruction from a Trustor to perform
such activities, the Company s responsibility for criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) for the Platform is solely with regard to the manner of holding trust assets and investment of trust assets in eligible investments and the Company does not have any
duties as to the original UCC filing and any continuations to perfect the security interest unless instructed to do so by other parties in the transaction agreement. 
 4. Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. Appendix B to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. The
Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect to Servicing Cnterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has determined that for certain transactions in the Platform the Trustor (as such term is

to servicing criterion 1122(dX4)(iii). the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require
the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the
Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on
our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public

Managements Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this Servicing Criterion. The Company has determined that this
