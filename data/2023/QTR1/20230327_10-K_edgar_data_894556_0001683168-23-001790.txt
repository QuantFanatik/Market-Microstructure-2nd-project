PART I 

ITEM 1. Description of Business 

Company Background 

General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. (the Company was incorporated as Ultronics Corporation (the UC under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 1990. UC
never had operations and was formed to investigate potential companies that would be interested in merging with it. 

On December 21, 2004, UC formed a subsidiary,
Ultronics Acquisition Corporation UAC for the purpose of facilitating an agreement and plan of merger. UAC was incorporated
in the State of Nevada. On December 23, 2004, UC, UAC and General Environmental Management, Inc. GEM entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby UAC would be merged into GEM Merger with GEM to be the surviving corporation.
On February 14, 2005, a Certificate of Merger was filed in Delaware; however, there is no evidence of a Certificate of Merger being filed
in Nevada. As such, GEM did not cease to exist in Nevada. 

The acquisition was treated as a reverse merger
with GEM deemed to be the accounting acquiror, and UAC the legal acquiror. UAC s name was changed to General Environmental Management,
Inc. (the Company on March 16, 2005. On March 10, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement with K2M Mobile Treatment
Services, Inc. of Long Beach, California K2M ), a privately held company, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of
the issued and outstanding common stock of K2M. 

On August 31, 2008, The Company entered into an
agreement with Island Environmental Services, Inc. of Pomona, California Island ), a privately held company, pursuant to
which The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Island, a California-based provider of hazardous and non-hazardous
waste removal and remediation services to a variety of private and public sector establishments. 

On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement CLW Agreement with United States Environmental Response, LLC, a California limited liability
company pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of California Living Waters, Incorporated CLW ), a privately held company. CLW owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Santa Clara Waste
Water Company SCWW a California corporation. CLW's only operating subsidiary is SCWW. 

On November 25, 2009, the Company entered into
an Agreement with Luntz Acquisition (Delaware), LLC. Buyer pursuant to which the Company sold to Luntz all of the issued
and outstanding stock of the Company's primary operating subsidiaries for cash (the Sale ). On February 26, 2010, after approval
of the transaction by the Company s shareholders at a special meeting held on February 19, 2010, the Company completed the sale
of the entities created out of GEM DE. The net cash proceeds from the transaction were used by the Company to retire senior debt and other
obligations of the Company. The Company was not merged out of Nevada pursuant to this transaction. 

Subsequent to the Luntz transaction, the Company s
 revenues and expenses, operations, assets and liabilities were discontinued from February
2010 until January 2021. 

On March 19, 2019, Small Cap Compliance, LLC was
awarded custodianship of the Company by the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada. On May 19, 2019, the Company was revived in Nevada.
On May 30, 2019, the custodian filed an Amendment to the Designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company, and
filed a Custodian s Certification of Amendment certifying the same. 

1 

On January 15, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate
of Conversion from a Non-Delaware Corporation to a Delaware Corporation, and the associated Certificate of Incorporation, to become a
corporation in Delaware. Delaware recognized this domestication of the Company. 

On March 31, 2021, the Company formed
General Entertainment Ventures, Inc. GEVI in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of the
formation of GEVI was to merge the Company into GEVI pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

On April 10, 2021, after approval by
the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was merged into GEVI pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of the same date. GEVI is the accounting and legal acquiror of the Company. 

On June 3, 2021, after approval by the
board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was redomiciled to the State of Wyoming. 

On October 11, 2021,
after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was renamed General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., in
the State of Wyoming. 

Because the Company was dormant from the period
from February 2010 through January 2021, the Company used the following methodology to prepare its financial statements. All assets on
the Company s March 31, 2010 balance were deemed disposed of to a related party for no value for the quarter beginning April 1,
2010. All Company activities at that time became discontinued operations with the exception of accrued interest recorded on outstanding
debt. All liabilities outstanding as of March 31, 2010 remained on the Company s balance sheet accruing interest until the quarter
ending March 31, 2017 when they were written off due to the expiration of the Statue of Limitations.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of General Enterprise
Ventures, Inc.: 

We were engaged to audit the accompanying balance
sheets of General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related statement of
operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. As described in the following paragraph, because
the Company s records were not sufficient, we were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for
an audit opinion on the financial statements, and we do not express, an opinion on these financial statements. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s
significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Disclaimer Opinion: 

We were not engaged as auditors of the Company
until February of 2023 at which time much of the audit evidence necessary to provide a basis for an audit opinion had been destroyed or
lost. We were unable to satisfy ourselves by other audit procedures concerning the assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2010 and
2009, as well as the revenues and expenses recognized for the year then ended. As a result of these matters, we were unable to determine
whether any adjustments might have been found necessary in respect of recorded or unrecorded assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Because of the matters described in
the Basis for Disclaimer Opinion paragraph above, however, we were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide
a basis for an audit opinion. 

The company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Because of the significance of the matters described
in the Basis for Disclaimer Opinion paragraph, we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis
for an audit opinion. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on these financial statements.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. 
 ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 

General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. (the Company was incorporated as Ultronics Corporation (the UC under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 1990. UC
never had operations and was formed to investigate potential companies that would be interested in merging with it. 

On December 21, 2004, UC formed a subsidiary,

of the transaction by the Company s shareholders at a special meeting held on February 19, 2010, the Company completed the sale
of the entities created out of GEM DE. The net cash proceeds from the transaction were used by the Company to retire senior debt and other
obligations of the Company. The Company was not merged out of Nevada pursuant to this transaction. 

Subsequent to the Luntz transaction, the Company s
 revenues and expenses, operations, assets and liabilities were discontinued from February
2010 until January 2021. 

On March 19, 2019, Small Cap Compliance, LLC was
awarded custodianship of the Company by the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada. On May 19, 2019, the Company was revived in Nevada.
On May 30, 2019, the custodian filed an Amendment to the Designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company, and

F- 7

board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was redomiciled to the State of Wyoming. 

On October 11, 2021,
after approval by the board of directors and shareholders of the Company, the Company was renamed General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., in
the State of Wyoming. 

The Company s year-end
is December 31st 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The consolidated interim financial statements
included herein have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in
the opinion of management, include all adjustments which, except, as described elsewhere herein, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented. 

Because the Company was dormant from the period
from February 2010 through January 2021, the Company used the following methodology to prepare its financial statements. All assets on
the Company s March 31, 2010 balance were deemed disposed of for no value to a related party for the quarter beginning April 1,
2010. All Company activities at that time became discontinued operations with the exception of accrued interest recorded on outstanding
debt. All liabilities outstanding as of March 31, 2010 remained on the Company s balance sheet accruing interest until the quarter
ending March 31, 2017 when they were written off due to the expiration of the Statue of Limitations. 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company utilized cash in operations of 7,734,743
for the year ended December 31, 2010 and as of December 31, 2010 the Company had a working capital deficiency of 18,545,048
and had a stockholders deficit of 86,950,430. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company will also research technological opportunities
in the waste-to-energy (W-T-E) marketplace as a further resource for our non-hazardous waste water treatment facilities. A W-T-E
solution for managing the treating waste provides a significant advantage for generators of the waste, the environment, and the Company. 

The Company will continue to develop SCWW as the
foundation of our core business in the non-hazardous waste water treatment sector. We intend to do this through internal growth
by offering SCWW s integrated solution for generators of non-hazardous waste water and by making strategic acquisitions of non-hazardous
waste water treatment companies. 

F- 8 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

(a) Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of General Enterprise Ventures Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, General Environmental Management, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, Island Environmental Services, Inc., a California corporation, General Environmental Management of Rancho Cordova,
LLC and California Living Waters Inc. Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

(b) Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company s management to make certain
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions will also
affect the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially
based on any changes in the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in the preparation of its financial statements that are reviewed
no less than annually. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions due to changes in environmental-related
regulations or future operational plans, and the inherent imprecision associated with estimating such future matters. 

(c) Revenue Recognition 

The Company's business activities include providing wastewater treatment
for companies and haulers in Ventura County, California, and in adjacent counties. The Company recognizes revenue at the time its customers
unload untreated wastewater at the Company's facility. Concurrent with the recognition of revenue, the Company records the estimated costs
to treat and dispose of the wastewater on hand. 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 

(d) Concentrations of Credit Risks 

The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade receivables. The Company places its cash in what it believes to be credit-worthy
financial institutions. However, cash balances have exceeded FDIC insured levels at various times. The Company has
not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk in cash. 

The Company s trade receivables result primarily from removal
or transportation of waste, and the concentration of credit risk is limited to a broad customer base located throughout the Western United
States. 

(e) Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair Value Measurements are adopted by the Company
based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board , with the exception of the application of the
statement to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. The adoption based on the authoritative guidance provided
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board did not have a material impact on the Company's fair value measurements. Based on the authoritative
guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. FASB authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2- Inputs, other than the quoted prices
in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3- Unobservable inputs based on the Company's
assumptions. 

F- 9 

FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires
the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. 

(f) Stock Compensation Costs 

The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants to employees and non-employees in capital raising transactions, for services and for financing costs. Stock-based
compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service
period. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the grant date. 

(g) Earnings per share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted earnings
per share calculation give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method
for warrants and options and the if-converted method for convertible debentures. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative
guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2010, with earlier adoption permitted. Under
the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to
the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled
products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. We believe adoption of this new guidance will
not have a material impact on our financial statements. 

In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance on
improving disclosures about fair value measurements to add new disclosure requirements for significant transfers in and out of Level
1 and 2 measurements and to provide a gross presentation of the activities within the Level 3 roll-forward. The
guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to present the Level 3 roll-forward on a gross basis, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance was limited to the form and content of
disclosures, and will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material
impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements .

and the payoff of the notes to CVC, the Revolving Credit Note was amended and restated so as to provide for (a) the reduced principal
balance (after giving effect to the payment described above), (b) the elimination of any right to further Advances; (c) interest on the
principal balance from time to time to be paid monthly in arrears as currently provided in the Revolving Credit Note, and (d) principal
to be payable (i) as, when and to the extent that payments are received by GEM under the Royalty Provisions, (ii) from amounts paid to
or in respect of the Borrower under Section 10.12 of the GEM MTS Purchase Agreement or otherwise in respect of the 900,000 deposit in
the Union Bank trust account, and (iii) to the extent not theretofore paid, any remaining balance of the amended and restated Revolving
Credit Note shall be due and payable on demand (or, if no demand is earlier made, then on March 1, 2011). (Other than as stated
herein, the Revolving Credit Note shall remain unchanged and shall remain in full force and effect.) In furtherance of the
foregoing, immediately after the Closing, GEM gave irrevocable written instructions to MTS Acquisition Company, Inc. MTS to remit all payments on the Purchase Money Note and pursuant to the Royalty Provisions directly to CVC, until otherwise instructed in
writing by the CVC, and (B) GEM gave irrevocable written instructions to PSC to remit all amounts payable under Section 10.12 of the Purchase
Agreement directly to CVC; and GEM shall not agree to any amendment of Section 10.12 of the Purchase Agreement or waive any required performance
there-under without the Lender s prior written consent. To the extent that, at any time, CVC shall have received payment
in full of the amended and restated Revolving Credit Note and all other Obligations pursuant to the direct payments contemplated in the
preceding sentence or otherwise, then CVC shall promptly (x) remit any excess amounts collected to GEM, and (y) give written notice to
MTS and/or PSC (as applicable) that payments that would otherwise thereafter be made to CVC as aforesaid shall instead be paid directly
to GEM or whomever else shall be entitled thereto. The balance of the revolving credit note was 1,177,027 at December 31,
2010.

note holders. The warrants are exercisable at 0.52 per share and have a forty (40) month term. The value of these warrants was calculated
at 231,140 and included in the statement of operations for the year ending December 31, 2009 as a cost to induce conversion. For
the Black Scholes calculation, the Company assumed no dividend yield, a risk free interest rate of 1.72 and expected volatility of 104.54

7. DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES 

In 2009, the Company adopted the FASB s
guidance on Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entity s Own Stock. This guidance
requires that instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments. The conversion
feature of the Company s Secured Financing and the related warrants, do not have fixed settlement provisions because their conversion
and exercise prices, respectively, may be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future. The Company
was required to include the reset provisions in order to protect the note holders from the potential dilution associated with future financings.
In accordance with current guidance, the conversion feature of the notes was separated from the host contract (i.e., the notes) and recognized
as an embedded derivative instrument at December 31, 2009. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company eliminated these
derivative liabilities. 

F- 17 

The derivative liabilities were valued as of December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009 using a probability weighted Black-Scholes-Merton valuation technique with the following weighted average assumptions: 

December 31, 2010

 Warrants

The risk-free interest rate was based on rates
established by the Federal Reserve. The expected volatility was based on the Company s historical volatility for its
common stock. The expected life of the conversion feature of the notes was based on the term of the notes and the expected
life of the warrants was determined by the expiration date of the warrants. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact
that the Company has not paid dividends to common shareholders in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to common shareholders
in the future. 

Warrant Liability 

In connection with the CVC financings
described in Note 7, the Company had granted to CVC an Amended and Restated Warrant to purchase Two Million Seven Hundred
Thousand (2,700,000) fully paid and non-assessable shares (the Warrant Shares of the Company s common stock,
for cash at a price of 0.01 per share at any time and from time to time from and after the date hereof and until 5:00 p.m. (Pacific
time) on August 31, 2014. CVC also had the right and option, exercisable effective at any time upon
or after the consummation of a Sale of the Company s revenue-generating business units, or upon and after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default or any other event or circumstance which causes, effects or requires any payment in
full under the Loan Agreement and until the Expiration Date, to require the Company to redeem and purchase any or all Warrant Shares
or rights to purchase Warrant Shares hereunder, for a cash purchase price of 0.75 per Warrant Share or per right to purchase a
Warrant Share hereunder, such option purchase price to be subject to adjustment from time to time in respect of certain
events. The total value of the put if all shares are redeemed was 2,025,000, and was recorded as a derivative liability
at December 31, 2009. In conjunction with the closing and the Amended and Restated Warrant to Purchase Shares of Common
Stock, CVC of California exercised its put option related to its warrant for 2,700,000 shares for a cash purchase price of 0.75 per
Warrant Share or 2,000,000. At closing, CVC was paid 500,000 and issued 3,750,000 shares of the Company s common
stock valued at 712,500 to satisfy the put option, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of the derivative liability of 812,500 in
the accompanying March 31, 2010 statement of operations. 

F- 18 

Conversion feature 

The principal amount of the Convertible Note and
accrued interest thereon due CVC was convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a price of 0.60 per share, subject to certain
adjustments. The convertible feature gave rise to a derivative liability that was valued at 896,542 at December 31, 2009.
Concurrent with the extinguishment of the convertible note during 2010, the derivative liability was extinguished and a gain of 896,542
was recorded in the accompanying March 31, 2010 statement of operations. 

8. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS 

On March 28, 2007 the Board of Directors approved
and implemented the 2007 Stock Option Plan (the Plan ). The plan authorized option grants to employees and other

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Legal Proceeding 

On July 5, 2007, a lawsuit was instituted by Romic
Environmental Technologies Corp. RET against the Company and four of its senior executives, all of whom were formerly
employed by RET. The lawsuit was brought in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. The lawsuit
was settled by the Company in February 2010 with the majority of the settlement payment funded by insurance. 

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the
Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or liquidity. 

10. INCOME TAXES 

The Company's net deferred tax assets consisted
of the following at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:

 Net deferred tax asset 

As of March 31, 2010, the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 27,245,415 expiring in various
years through 2025, which can be used to offset future taxable income, if any. No deferred asset benefit for these operating losses has
been recognized in the financial statements due to the uncertainty as to their realizability in future periods. 

As of March 31, 2010, the Company recorded a gain
on the sale of General Environmental Management, Inc. (DE) and its subsidiaries GEM Delaware ), which include
five service centers, the TSDF of GEM Rancho Cordova LLC, and the Island Environmental Services business (See Note 4). Due
to the State of California disallowing the use of NOL carryforwards for the calendar year 2010, the Company recorded a state tax provision
of 325,000. Due to the affect of the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax on the gain transaction, the Company recorded a 100,000
federal tax provision.

Reconciliation of the effective income tax rate
to the United States statutory income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 

Year ended 

2010 
 
 Tax expense at U.S. statutory income tax rate 
 (34.0 
 
 Increase in the valuation allowance 
 34.0 
 
 Effective rate 

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted a
new accounting requirement to Account for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The interpretation addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under the new accounting
requirements, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The new requirements also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption, and
as of March 31, 2010, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax uncertainties. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction and various states. The Company is subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for
years after 2002. During the periods open to examination, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards for U.S.
federal and state tax purposes that have attributes from closed periods. Because these NOLs and tax credit carry forwards may
be utilized in future periods, they remain subject to examination. 

The Company s policy is to record interest
and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of March 31, 2010 the Company has no accrued interest or penalties
related to uncertain tax positions.

ITEM 9A (T). Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act
(defined below)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material
respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Because the Company was dormant from February
2010 to January 2021 disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010 are deemed to be ineffective 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

In addition, our management with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during or subsequent
to the year ended December 31, 2010 that internal control over financial reporting is deemed to be ineffective.
