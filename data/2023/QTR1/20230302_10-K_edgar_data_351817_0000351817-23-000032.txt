Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 
 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, references to SilverBow Resources, SilverBow, the Company, we, our, ours and us refer to SilverBow Resources, Inc. See pages 36 and 37 for explanations of abbreviations and terms used herein. 
 
 Overview 
 
 SilverBow Resources is an independent oil and gas company headquartered in Houston, Texas. The Company, originally founded in 1979, was reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 2016. SilverBow's strategy is focused on acquiring and developing assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk located in South Texas where the Company has assembled approximately 180,000 net acres across five operating areas. SilverBow's acreage position in each of its operating areas is highly contiguous and designed for optimal and efficient horizontal well development. The Company has built a balanced portfolio of properties with a significant base of current production and reserves coupled with low-risk development drilling opportunities and meaningful upside from newer operating areas. 
 
 SilverBow produced an average of 315 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day MMcfe/d during the fourth quarter of 2022 and had proved reserves of 2,235 Bcfe (77 natural gas) with a Standardized Measure of 4.0 billion and a PV-10 of 5.0 billion at SEC pricing as of December 31, 2022. PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure; see the section titled Oil and Natural Gas Reserves of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flow, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 Being a committed and long-term operator in South Texas, the Company possesses a significant understanding of the reservoir characteristics, geology, landowner relations and the competitive landscape in the region. SilverBow leverages this in-depth knowledge to consolidate high quality drilling inventory while continuously enhancing its operations to maximize returns on capital invested. 
 
 Business Strategies 
 
 Leverage technical expertise to efficiently develop Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk drilling locations . As of December 31, 2022, our technical team has an average of approximately 16 years of experience per person which we believe gives us a technical advantage when developing and organically expanding our asset base. We leverage this advantage in our existing asset base to create highly efficient drilling and completion operations. Concentrating solely on the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk allows us to use our operating, technical and regional expertise to interpret geological and operating trends, enhance production rates and maximize well recovery. We are focused on enhancing asset value through utilizing cost-effective technology to locate the highest quality intervals to drill and complete oil and gas wells. We continue to optimize our drilling techniques, shorten our drill times and steer our laterals to target high quality intervals in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk. We have also enhanced fracture stimulation designs, optimizing fluid and proppant usage and fracture stage spacing. We believe these factors will enhance the return profile of our drilling and completion operations. Our 2023 capital budget range of 450- 475 million provides for drilling 60 gross (52 net) horizontal wells which is expected to be funded primarily from operating cash flow and borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 
 Prudently grow and maintain balanced inventory of locations. Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have the potential to exhibit volatile and unpredictable fluctuations. Further, the timing and duration of such fluctuations are difficult to predict. Our diversification strategy allows us to pursue our most economic hydrocarbon locations that in turn generate the most compelling returns, with the ability to shift our focus to locations with different hydrocarbon mixes based on prevailing prices. Given the strength in commodity prices in 2022, the Company's drilling and completion D C program emphasized both oil and gas development. Of the 656 gross horizontal drilling locations at year-end 2022, 430 are oil locations and 226 are gas locations. We assess optimal production timing in response to the market and are agile enough to strategically shift sales to higher prices periods. 
 
 Operate our properties as a low-cost producer. We believe our concentrated acreage position and our experience as an operator of substantially all of our properties enables us to apply drilling and completion techniques and economies of scale that improve returns. Operating control allows us to manage pace of development, timing, and associated annual capital expenditures. Furthermore, we are able to achieve lower operating costs through concentrated infrastructure and field operations. In addition, our contiguous acreage position allows the Company to drill multiple wells from a single pad while optimizing lateral lengths. Pad drilling reduces facilities costs and consolidates surface level operations. Our 
 6 

operational control is critical for us to be able to transfer successful D C techniques and cost cutting initiatives from one field to another. Finally, we will continue to leverage our proximity to end-user markets of natural gas hubs. 
 
 Continue to pursue strategic opportunities to further expand our asset base. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to expand our core position through leasing and acquisitions. We regularly seek to acquire oil and gas properties that complement our operations, provide exploration and development opportunities, and provide enhanced cash flow and corporate returns. The Company closed four notable acquisitions in 2022. These acquisitions, in aggregate, added 3,800 barrels per day (Bbls/d) and 14 million cubic feet per day MMcf/d to the Company s full year 2022 net production. This represented 14 of the Company's 2022 net production. SilverBow expects these acquisitions to comprise a greater percentage of its 2023 net production. 
 
 In total the Company paid 367.0 million in cash and issued 156.3 million in equity related to these transactions. We plan to continue strategically targeting certain areas of the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk where our technical experience and successful drilling results can be replicated and expanded. We believe our extensive basin-wide experience and relationships gives us a competitive advantage in locating both strategic acquisitions and ground-floor leasing opportunities to expand our core acreage position in the future. 
 
 Maintain our financial flexibility and liquidity profile. We are committed to preserving our financial flexibility and are focused on continued growth in a disciplined manner. We have historically funded our capital program by using a combination of internally generated cash flow and funds available on our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 233.0 million in available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which we believe, along with our projected operating cash flow, provides us with liquidity to execute our 2023 development plan and opportunistically acquire or lease additional acreage. Our Credit Facility and Second Lien (as defined in Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K), maturing in October 2026 and December 2026, respectively, are our only debt maturities. 
 
 Manage risk exposure. We utilize a disciplined hedging program to limit our exposure to volatility in commodity prices and achieve a more predictable level of cash flow to support current and future capital expenditure plans. We take a systematic approach to hedging and periodically add hedges to our portfolio in an effort to protect the rates of returns on our drilling program. As of February 24, 2023, we had approximately 73 of total production volumes hedged for full year 2023, using the midpoint of the Company's production guidance of 325 - 345 MMcfe/d. 
 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 
 Inventory of drilling locations with high degree of operational control. We have developed a significant inventory of future drilling locations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 180,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk and 656 gross horizontal drilling locations, representing over 10 years of core premium inventory at a two-rig pace. Approximately 57 of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were undeveloped. We operate essentially all of our proved reserves and have an average working interest of approximately 90 across our identified locations. These factors provide us with a high level of control over our operations, allowing us to manage our development drilling schedule, utilize pad drilling where applicable, and implement leading edge completion techniques. We plan to continue to deliver production, reserve and cash flow growth by developing our extensive inventory of low-risk drilling locations in a disciplined manner. 
 
 Ability to adjust cadence and hydrocarbon mix of operations activity. The ability to adjust our D C schedule in response to management's outlook and view of commodity prices allows us to focus on the highest return, lowest risk projects. In 2022, we drilled 45 net wells, completed 39 net wells and brought 37 net wells online. The Company operated one drilling rig through the first half of 2022 and added a second rig in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition of substantially all of the oil and gas assets of Sundance Energy, Inc. and its affiliated entities (collectively, Sundance on June 30, 2022. At the beginning of October, the Company moved both its drilling rigs to its Webb County Gas area. This decision was based on the continued strong Austin Chalk results in the Dorado play. 
 
 Proximity to Demand Centers. Our assets are positioned in one of the most economically advantaged natural gas and oil regions of North America. Our proximity to the Gulf Coast affords us much lower commodity basis differentials and meaningfully higher price realizations when compared to other domestic basins. For instance, in 2022 our average natural gas basis differentials to NYMEX were 0.28/Mcf discount versus 1.25/Mcf discount for the Permian Basin index into the El Paso pipeline. Additionally, our assets are in close proximity to the largest and highest growth natural gas and NGL demand centers, including increasing LNG exports, natural gas exports to Mexico and industrial, petrochemical, and power demand in the Gulf Coast markets. 
 7 

Experienced and proven technical team. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 17 oil and gas technical professionals, including geoscientists, drilling, completion, production and reservoir engineers, and other oil and gas professionals who collectively have an average of approximately 16 years of experience in their technical fields. Our technical team has come from a number of large and successful organizations. They are focused on utilizing modern completion techniques to increase our estimated ultimate recovery and maximize our per-well returns. Our enhanced completion designs include tighter fracture stage spacing as well as optimized proppant loadings and intensity. Additionally, we rely on advanced technologies to better define geologic risk and enhance the results of our drilling efforts. We continually apply our extensive in-house experience and current technologies to benefit our drilling and production operations. 
 
 Proven low cost operator with contiguous acreage. Our core acreage position is contiguous in nature which allows us to lower per unit costs through drilling longer laterals, utilizing pad drilling, consolidating in-field infrastructure, and efficiently sourcing materials through our procurement strategies. We believe the nature of our positions and our operational improvements and efficiencies will allow us to continue to successfully mitigate service cost inflation. Additionally, we continually seek to optimize our production operations with the objective of reducing our operating costs through efficient well management. Finally, our significant operational control, as well as our manageable leasehold drilling obligations, provide us the flexibility to control our costs. 
 
 Balance Sheet discipline and robust liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 233.0 million in available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, which we believe, along with our operating cash flow, provides us with a sufficient amount of liquidity to execute our 2023 development plan and opportunistically acquire or lease additional acreage even with modest changes in the commodity environment. Our Credit Facility and Second Lien, maturing in October 2026 and December 2026, respectively, are our only debt maturities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 542.0 million drawn on our 775.0 million borrowing base under the Credit Facility.

 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 
 The following tables present information regarding proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to SilverBow's interests in proved properties as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The information set forth in the tables regarding reserves is based on proved reserves reports prepared in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules. H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. Gruy ), independent petroleum engineers, prepared the Company's proved reserves reports as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 The reserves estimation process involves members of the reserves and evaluation department who report to the Chief Reservoir Engineer. The staff includes engineers whose duty is to prepare estimates of reserves in accordance with the SEC's rules, regulations and guidelines. This team worked closely with Gruy to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data utilized for the preparation of the 2022, 2021 and 2020 reserve reports. To achieve reasonable certainty for our reserve estimates, we and Gruy employ technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability and use standard engineering technologies and methods, which are generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The technologies and economic data used to calculate our proved reserves estimates include, but are not limited to, well logs, production tests, seismic data and core data. Our proved reserves additions are prepared using extrapolation of established historical production trends from offsetting producing wells, with similar completions, in analogous reservoirs. Reasonable certainty is further confirmed by applying one or more of these supplemental methods: reservoir modeling which may include analytical and numerical methods, rate transient analysis and geoscience examination, including petrophysical analysis to confirm reservoir continuity. All information from SilverBow's secure engineering database as well as geographic maps, well logs, production tests and other pertinent data were provided to Gruy. 
 
 The Chief Reservoir Engineer supervises this process with multiple levels of review and reconciliation of reserve estimates to ensure they conform to SEC guidelines. Reserves data are also reported to and reviewed by senior management quarterly. The Board of Directors (the Board reviews the reserve data periodically and the independent Board members meet with Gruy in executive sessions at least annually. 
 
 The technical person at Gruy primarily responsible for overseeing preparation of the 2022, 2021 and 2020 reserves report and the audits of prior year reports is a Licensed Professional Engineer, holds a degree in petroleum engineering, is past Chairman of the Gulf Coast Section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, is past President of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, and has over 30 years of experience in preparing reserves reports and overseeing reserves audits. 
 
 The Company's Chief Reservoir Engineer, the primary technical person responsible for overseeing the preparation of its 2022, 2021 and 2020 reserve estimates, holds a bachelor's degree in geology, is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Professional Well Log Analysts, and has over 25 years of experience in petrophysical analysis, reservoir engineering, and reserves estimation. 
 
 Estimates of future net revenues from SilverBow's proved reserves, Standardized Measure and PV-10 (PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure defined below), as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are made in accordance with SEC criteria, which is based on the preceding 12-months' average adjusted price after differentials based on closing prices on the first business day of each month (excluding the effects of hedging) and are held constant for that year's reserves calculation throughout the life of the properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of natural gas contracts, the use 
 9 

of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. The Company has interests in certain tracts that are estimated to have additional hydrocarbon reserves that cannot be classified as proved and are not reflected in the following tables. 
 
 The following prices were used to estimate SilverBow's SEC proved reserve volumes, year-end Standardized Measure and PV-10. The 12-month 2022 average adjusted prices after differentials were 6.14 per Mcf of natural gas, 94.36 per barrel of oil, and 34.76 per barrel of NGL, compared to 3.75 per Mcf of natural gas, 63.98 per barrel of oil, and 25.29 per barrel of NGL for 2021 and 2.13 per Mcf of natural gas, 37.83 per barrel of oil, and 11.66 per barrel of NGL for 2020. 
 
 As noted above, PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to the PV-10 Value is the Standardized Measure. The Company believes the PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the value of proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties without regard to the owner's income tax position. SilverBow uses the PV-10 Value for comparison against its debt balances, to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment in its oil and gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any GAAP measure. The Company's PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of SilverBow's proved oil and natural gas reserves. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation between the Standardized Measure (the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) and PV-10 Value of the Company's proved reserves: 
 As of December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 4,040 1,558 513 Adjusted for: Future income taxes (discounted at 10 924 259 13 PV-10 Value 4,964 1,817 526

The following tables set forth estimates of future net revenues presented on the basis of unescalated prices and costs in accordance with criteria prescribed by the SEC and presented on a Standardized Measure and PV-10 basis as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Operating costs, development costs, asset retirement obligation costs, and certain production-related taxes were deducted in arriving at the estimated future net revenues. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, SilverBow had estimated proved reserves of 2,235 Bcfe with a Standardized Measure of 4.0 billion and PV-10 Value of 5.0 billion. This is an increase of approximately 819 Bcfe from the Company's year-end 2021 proved reserves quantities primarily due to increases in our reserves primarily from our acquisitions during the year. SilverBow's total proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were approximately 14 crude oil, 77 natural gas, and 9 NGLs, while 43 of its total proved reserves were developed. Essentially all of the Company's proved reserves are located in Texas. The following amounts shown in MMcfe below are based on an oil and natural gas liquids conversion factor of 1 Bbl to 6 Mcf: 
 Estimated Proved Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Natural gas reserves (MMcf): Proved developed 695,482 525,737 415,390 Proved undeveloped 1,030,071 629,643 532,704 Total 1,725,553 1,155,380 948,094 Oil reserves (MBbl): Proved developed 23,360 9,692 6,963 Proved undeveloped 28,829 14,606 5,569 Total 52,189 24,298 12,532 NGL reserves (MBbl): Proved developed 19,523 12,390 8,164 Proved undeveloped 13,133 6,710 5,692 Total 32,656 19,100 13,855 Total Estimated Reserves (MMcfe) (1)

 (1) The reserve volumes exclude natural gas consumed in operations. 
 (2) The Standardized Measure and PV-10 Values as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are net of 6.1 million, 3.5 million and 2.2 million of plugging and abandonment costs, respectively. 
 
 Proved reserves are estimates of hydrocarbons to be recovered in the future. Reserves estimation is a subjective process of estimating the sizes of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves reports of other engineers might differ from the reports contained herein. Results of drilling, testing, and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Future prices received for the sale of oil and natural gas may be different from those used in preparing these reports. The amounts and timing of future operating and development costs may also differ from those used. Accordingly, reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. There can be no assurance that these estimates are accurate predictions of the present value of future net cash flow from oil and natural gas reserves.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
 
 The following table sets forth the aging of SilverBow's proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2022: 
 Year Added Volume 
 (Bcfe) 
 of PUD 
 Volumes 
 of PV-10 
 2022 664.4 52 51 2021 372.4 29 31 2020 78.8 6 5 2019 131.3 10 11 2018 34.9 3 2 Total 1,281.8 100 100 
 
 During 2022, the Company's proved undeveloped reserves increased by approximately 524.3 Bcfe primarily due to increases in our natural gas reserves from extensions of 513.5 Bcfe (121.0 Bcfe as a result of successful drilling on existing leases and 392.5 Bcfe related to new adjacent leases acquired in 2022), acquisitions of approximately 149.3 Bcfe and positive revisions of approximately 13.6 Bcfe. The increases were partially offset by negative revisions of 2.8 Bcfe related to changes in the development plan. Further, SilverBow incurred approximately 165.5 million in capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) during the year which resulted in the conversion of 149.3 Bcfe of its December 31, 2021 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily in our Webb County Gas area. During 2021, the Company's proved undeveloped reserves increased by approximately 157.3 Bcfe primarily due to increases in our natural gas reserves from acquisitions of approximately 166.1 Bcfe and extensions of 313.2 Bcfe. The increases were partially offset by removals and negative revisions of approximately 198.7 Bcfe. 
 
 We maintain a five-year development plan adopted by our management, which includes proved undeveloped locations in our reserve report that are scheduled to be drilling within five years from the year they were initially disclosed. The development plan is reviewed annually to ensure capital is allocated to the wells that have the highest risk-adjusted rates of return within our inventory of undrilled well locations. As of December 31, 2022, no material amount of proved undeveloped reserves were not scheduled to be converted to proved developed status within five years from the year they were initially disclosed. 
 
 The PV-10 Value from the Company's proved undeveloped reserves was 2,384.6 million at December 31, 2022, which was approximately 48 of its total PV-10 Value of 5.0 billion. 
 
 Sensitivity of Reserves to Pricing 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, a 5 increase in natural gas pricing would increase SilverBow's total estimated proved reserves by approximately 1.8 Bcfe and would increase the PV-10 Value by approximately 235.3 million. Similarly, a 5 decrease in natural gas pricing would decrease the Company's total estimated proved reserves by approximately 1.9 Bcfe and would decrease the PV-10 Value by approximately 235.2 million. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, a 5 increase in oil and NGL pricing would increase SilverBow's total estimated proved reserves by approximately 3.4 Bcfe, and would increase the PV-10 Value by approximately 154.7 million. Similarly, a 5 decrease in oil and NGL pricing would decrease the Company's total estimated proved reserves by approximately 7.2 Bcfe and would decrease the PV-10 Value by approximately 153.7 million. 
 
 This sensitivity analysis is as of December 31, 2022 and, accordingly, does not consider drilling and completion activity, acquisitions or dispositions of oil and gas properties, production, changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, and changes in development and operating costs occurring subsequent to December 31, 2022 that may require revisions to estimates of proved reserves.

 183,762 146,370 33,618 33,618 
 (1) The Company's total Texas acreage is located in the Eagle Ford field. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, SilverBow's net undeveloped acreage in Texas subject to expiration, if not renewed, is approximately 76 in 2023, 13 in 2024, 3 in 2025 and 8 in 2026 and thereafter. In our core areas, acreage scheduled to expire can be held through drilling operations or SilverBow can exercise extension options. The exploration potential of all undeveloped acreage is fully evaluated before expiration. In each fiscal year where undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration, our intent is to reduce the expirations through either development or extensions, if we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so.

Drilling and Other Exploratory and Development Activities 
 
 The following table sets forth the results of the Company's drilling and completion activities during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 Gross Wells Net Wells Year Type of Well Total Productive Dry Total Productive Dry 2022 Exploratory Development 47 47 45.2 45.2 2021 Exploratory Development 21 21 18.7 18.7 2020 Exploratory Development 19 19 14.8 14.8 
 
 Recent Activities 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, SilverBow was in the process of drilling 4 wells in our Central Oil and Western Condensate areas where we have a 100 working interest. These wells were completed in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 Operations 
 
 The Company generally seeks to be the operator of the wells in which it has a significant economic interest. As operator, SilverBow designs and manages the development of a well and supervises operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. The Company does not own drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties it operates. Independent contractors supervised by SilverBow provide this equipment and personnel. The Company employs drilling, production and reservoir engineers, geoscientists, and other specialists who work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating SilverBow's oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 Operations on the Company's oil and natural gas properties are customarily accounted for in accordance with Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies' guidelines. SilverBow charges a monthly per-well supervision fee to the wells it operates including its wells in which it owns up to a 100 working interest. Supervision fees vary widely depending on the geographic location and depth of the well and whether the well produces oil or natural gas. The fees for these activities in 2022 totaled 8.8 million and ranged from 51 to 1,711 per well per month. 
 
 14 

Marketing of Production 
 
 The Company typically sells its oil and natural gas production at market prices near the wellhead or at a central point after gathering and/or processing. SilverBow usually sells its natural gas in the spot market on a seasonal or monthly basis, while it sells its oil at prevailing market prices. The Company does not refine any oil it produces. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, parties which accounted for approximately 10 or more of SilverBow's total oil and gas receipts were as follows: 
 Purchasers greater than 10 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Kinder Morgan 22 26 Plains Marketing 11 10 Twin Eagle 15 Trafigura 14 16 Shell Trading 12 12 
 Oil and gas receipts less than 10 
 
 The Company has a gas gathering agreements with Howard Energy Partners providing for the transportation of SilverBow's Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk production on the pipeline from our Fasken, Rio Bravo, La Mesa and Northern Webb areas to the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Eagle Ford Midstream or Howard's Impulsora Pipeline (Nueva Era), where it is sold at prices tied to monthly and daily natural gas price indices. At Fasken, the Company also has a connection with the Navarro gathering system into which it may deliver natural gas from time to time. 
 
 The Company has an agreement with Eagle Ford Gathering LLC that provides for the gathering and processing for almost all of its natural gas production in the Artesia area. Natural gas in the area can also be delivered to the Targa system for processing and transportation to downstream markets. In the Artesia area, the Company's oil production is sold at prevailing market prices and transported to market by truck. 
 
 The prices in the tables below do not include the effects of hedging. Quarterly prices are detailed under Results of Operations Revenues in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company has gas processing and gathering agreements with Targa Resources Corp. and DCP South Central Texas, LLC for a majority of SilverBow's natural gas production in the AWP area. Oil production is transported to market by truck and sold at prevailing market prices. 
 
 The Company has a gas gathering and processing agreement with Copano Energy (Kinder Morgan) for the majority of its gas in the Shiner, Texas area, as well as a gas gathering and processing agreement with Energy Transfer LP. Oil production is transported to market by truck and sold at prevailing market prices. 
 
 In its Central Oil-Oak area, the Company has agreements with various entities affiliated with Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. Enterprise entities that provide for the gathering of oil and natural gas, the processing of natural gas and the transportation of residue gas to sales points. The oil is sold at a central field facility into an Enterprise crude pipeline.

 Risk Management 
 
 The Company's operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, pipe failure, casing collapse, fires, and adverse weather conditions (including conditions exacerbated by climate change), each of which could result in severe damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells, production facilities or other property, or individual injuries. The oil and natural gas exploration business is also subject to environmental hazards, such as oil and produced water spills, natural gas leaks, and ruptures and discharges of toxic substances or gases that could expose SilverBow to substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage, including general liability insurance, operators extra expense insurance, and property damage insurance. SilverBow's standing Insurable Risk Advisory Team, which includes individuals from operations, drilling, facilities, legal, health safety and environmental and finance departments, meets regularly to evaluate risks, review property values, review and monitor claims, review market conditions and assist with the selection of coverages. The Company believes that its insurance is adequate and customary for companies of a similar size engaged in comparable operations, but if a significant accident or other event occurs that is uninsured or not fully covered by insurance, it could 
 16 

adversely affect SilverBow. Refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more details and for discussion of other risks. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 
 The oil and gas industry is affected by the volatility of commodity prices. Realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas. The Company has derivative instruments in place to protect a significant portion of its production against declines in oil prices th rough the fourth quarter of 2024 and natural gas prices through the fourth quarter of 2025. We belie ve SilverBow also has sufficient protection in place to protect against volatility in natural gas liquids prices through the fourth quarter of 2024. With regards to natural gas prices, there are regular patterns of price fluctuation throughout the year. Seasonality, especially with regards to weather, helps the Company manage its physical volume exposure as well as financial price risk in the market. By anticipating seasonality, the Company can adjust its operations and look to reduce its financial risks. Supply, demand and storage are the three major factors used in analyzing commodity risk. Gas production is relatively stable, but may experience unexpected disruptions such as unscheduled pipeline maintenance or extreme weather. For additional discussion related to the Company's price-risk policy, refer to Note 5 of th e consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Competition 
 
 SilverBow operates in a highly competitive environment, competing with major integrated and independent energy companies for desirable oil and natural gas properties, as well as for equipment, labor, and materials required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial and technological resources substantially greater than the Company's. The market for oil and natural gas properties is highly competitive and SilverBow may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. The Company may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs SilverBow considers reasonable because of this competition. The Company's ability to replace and expand its reserve base depends on its continued ability to attract and retain quality personnel and identify and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects for future drilling and acquisition. 
 
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 
 
 SilverBow's business operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (v) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and completion activities. 
 
 The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. laws and regulations, as amended from time to time: 
 
 the Clean Air Act CAA ), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements and has been relied upon by the EPA as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas GHG emissions; 
 the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States; 
 the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur; 
 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes; 
 the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States; 
 17 

the Safe Drinking Water Act SDWA ), which ensures the quality of the nation s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources; 
 the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories; 
 the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures; 
 the Endangered Species Act ESA ), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and 
 the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment. 
 
 Additionally, there exist regional, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where the Company s operations are conducted that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. While the legal requirements imposed in state and local jurisdictions may be similar in form to federal laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly restrict, delay or cancel the permitting, development or expansion of SilverBow's operations or substantially increase the cost of doing business. Additionally, the Company s operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project's impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. These operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements. Moreover, whether at the federal, tribal, regional, state and local levels, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations may arise in the future to address potential environmental concerns such as air emissions, water discharges and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and groundwater or to address perceived health or safety-related concerns such as oil and natural gas development in close proximity to specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas. Any such future developments are expected to have a considerable impact on SilverBow's business and results of operations. 
 
 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting, delaying or prohibiting some or all of the Company's activities in a particular area. Additionally, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow environmental organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10 K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing, ozone standards, induced seismicity, climate change, and other environmental protection-related subjects. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards continue to evolve. 
 
 Over time, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment and, thus, any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on SilverBow's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, President Biden and the Democratic Party, which now controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. In January 2021, President Biden signed an executive order that, among other things, instructed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices. Following that executive order, the acting Secretary of the Interior issued an order imposing a 60-day pause on the issuance of new leases, permits and right-of-way grants for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, unless approved by senior officials at the Department of the Interior. In June 2021, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the pause of oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters while 
 18 

litigation challenging that aspect of the executive order is ongoing. President Biden s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms President Biden s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies decision making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. 
 
 The Company has incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Historically, SilverBow's environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on its business and operational results. 
 
 Human Capital 
 
 As SilverBow employees are critical to our success, the Company is committed to its workforce and seeks to support both its employees and contractors through its corporate culture, known as the SBOWay. The SBOWay is built on five tenets: 
 
 One Team; 
 Unleash Potential; 
 Drive Value; 
 Lead the Way, and 
 Safety Strong 
 
 These core tenets help drive SilverBow s human capital management and, in turn, enhance the Company s tenet to Drive Value for the organization. The Company s human resources department manages the human capital initiatives with the support and direction from SilverBow s senior management team. SilverBow has established internal committees, comprised of employees from all levels of the Company, that serve to shape and maintain the culture. These committees include: the SBOWay Committee, which is responsible for maintaining the culture, the SilverBow Cares Committee, which is responsible for maintaining the Company s community outreach programs, and the SilverBow Employee Association, which is tasked with employee engagement and teambuilding. Senior management also reinforces the SBOWay culture through quarterly townhalls and monthly emails on a specific cultural tenet. Ultimately, SilverBow s Board of Directors oversees the Company s human capital management practices, receiving periodic updates on workforce-related topics. 
 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 
 Overall, the Company is committed to be a workplace of inclusion, with a diversity of skill, viewpoints, backgrounds, experiences and demographics. SilverBow s SBOWay culture and One Team mentality provides the underlying framework to support and build upon the Company s dedication to a diverse workplace that fosters the attraction and retention of unique talents, personalities, work experiences, perspectives, culture, race, gender, sexual orientation and other differences to the Company.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below; however, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
 
 Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Risks Related to the Business: (2) Macroeconomic and Financial Risks; (3) Legal and Regulatory Risks; and (4) Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in the order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. 
 
 Risks Related to the Business : 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results, reduce liquidity and impede our growth. 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as: 
 
 the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; 
 the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; 
 actions by OPEC+ with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels; 
 the level of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources; 
 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity; 
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including regulations in connection with a response to climate change; 
 stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; 
 political conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including in the Middle East, South America, Africa and Russia; 
 weather conditions, natural disasters and global health events, including the continuing economic and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption; 
 overall U.S. and global economic and political conditions, including inflationary pressures, further increases in interest rates, a general economic slowdown or recession, political tensions and war (including future developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict); 
 the price and availability of alternative fuels; and 
 trade relations and policies, including the imposition of tariffs by the United States or others. 
 
 Prices for oil and natural gas are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to geopolitical stability and to changes in production from OPEC+ member states. For example, the ongoing conflict, and the continuation of, or any increase in the severity of, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has led and may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and natural gas prices. 
 
 Our financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position and reduce our liquidity. This would impact the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and continued development of our operations, making it increasingly difficult to operate our business. Additionally, any extended period of low commodity prices would impact our ability to access funds through the capital markets, if they are available at all. 
 
 Insufficient capital could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties. 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Our 2023 capital plan, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure and fulfillment of abandonment obligations, is expected to be between 450- 475 
 21 

million. In 2022, we had approximately 327.5 million of capital expenditures excluding acquisitions. Cash flow from operations is a principal source of our financing of our future capital expenditures. Insufficient cash flow from operations and inability to access capital could lead to the loss of leases that require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing reserves and production. Additionally, a decline in cash flow from operations may require us to revise our capital program or alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of debt or equity securities. 
 
 Further, developing and exploring properties for oil and natural gas not only requires significant capital expenditures, but involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. Budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise, impacting the Company s budgeted capital expenditures. Drilling may also be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties, which could impact the Company s cash flow from operations. 
 
 Most of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. 
 
 We own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established or we exercise an extension option on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have leases on 25,566 net acres in Texas that could potentially expire during fiscal year 2023, representing approximately 76 of our total net undeveloped acreage in Texas of 33,618 net acres. 
 
 Our drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling; therefore, there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections. 
 
 Estimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations. 
 
 The quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our year-end 2022 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates and could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flow from our oil and natural gas reserves. 
 
 Our oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses, which may be subject to substantial liability claims. 
 
 Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of: 
 
 hurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters (including events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change); 
 environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline or tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, blowouts, explosions and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment; 
 abnormally pressured formations; 
 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse; 
 fires and explosions; and 
 personal injuries and death. 
 22 

Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities, other property or natural resources, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Moreover, a potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters. To the extent such weather events or natural disasters become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and costs to repair damaged facilities could increase. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and natural gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance. Further, we may also elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, water disposal and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget and operate profitably. 
 
 Shortages, unavailability or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel, have delayed and adversely affected and could continue to delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations. If the price of oil and natural gas increases, the demand for production equipment and personnel will likely also increase, potentially resulting in shortages of equipment and personnel. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering drilling companies more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, this would potentially delay our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow and could also significantly increase the cost of producing those reserves, thereby negatively impacting anticipated net income. 
 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, a shortage of labor for certain functions, including due to changing oil and natural gas industry investment patterns and other factors, which has increased our labor costs and negatively impacted our profitability. The extent and duration of the effect of these labor market challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health crisis, the availability of qualified persons in the markets where we and our contracted service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, capital investment in the oil and natural gas industry as a whole, behavioral changes, prevailing wage rates and other benefits, inflation, the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage requirements) or government programs, the safety levels of our operations and our reputation within the labor market. 
 
 Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner. 
 
 Our operations include the need of water for use in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The Company s access to water may be limited due to reasons such as prolonged drought, private third party competition for water in localized areas, or the Company s inability to acquire or maintain water sourcing permits or other rights. In the past, Texas has experienced severe droughts that have limited the water supplies that are necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing. In addition, some state and local governmental authorities have begun to monitor or restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to ensure adequate local water supply. Any such decrease in the availability of water could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition and operations. Moreover, any inability by the Company to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact the Company s exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on the Company s business and financial condition. 
 
 A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. 
 
 Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations, damage to our properties and/or injuries. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations. 
 23 

Additionally, a cyber attack or information security breach could expose our employees, customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential personal information, which may expose us to reputational damage or legal liability. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cyber attacks. 
 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, efforts by hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access or deny access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information technology systems and networks. To date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber attacks or any material impact on our operations to date, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future, and future incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities. 
 
 In addition to the risks presented to our systems and networks, cyber attacks affecting oil and natural gas distribution systems maintained by third parties, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could delay or prevent delivery of our production to markets. Further, cyber attacks on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues. A cyber attack of this nature would be outside our control, but could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major contiguous area. 
 
 All of our operations are in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk in South Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area. A number of our properties could experience any of the same adverse conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that are more diversified. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, water shortages or other drought related conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of crude oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk. For example, a decrease in commodity prices or an excess supply of oil and natural gas in South Texas could result in a temporary curtailment or shut-in of our production or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the natural gas and oil we produce. Such delays, curtailments, shortages or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 Our property acquisitions carry significant risks. 
 
 Acquisition of oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production. Competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive candidates, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. In the event we do complete an acquisition, its success will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include future crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves, future operating and capital costs, results of future exploration, exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment, possible future environmental or other liabilities and the effect on our liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs and the assumption of potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. A customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. 
 
 Additionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited. 
 
 Integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks. These risks include potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term 
 24 

effects on our operating results, and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. 
 
 Health crises and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in the demand for natural gas and oil. The imbalance between the supply of and demand for these products, as well as the uncertainty around the extent and timing of an economic recovery, caused, and may continue to cause, extreme market volatility and a substantial adverse effect on commodity prices. The lack of a market, due to low commodity prices or a future decrease in commodity prices, or available storage for any one natural gas product or oil could result in us temporarily curtailing or shutting in such production as we may be unable to curtail the production of individual products in a meaningful way without reducing the production of other products. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or any inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the natural gas and oil we produce, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any excess supply could also lead to potential curtailments by our purchasers. Additionally, while we believe that any potential shutting-in of such production will not impact the productivity of such wells when reopened, there is no assurance we will not have a degradation in well performance upon returning those wells to production. The storing or shutting in of a portion of our production could potentially also result in increased costs under our midstream and other contracts. Any of the foregoing could result in an adverse impact on our revenue, financial position and cash flow. Additionally, health crises and pandemics contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, a shortage of equipment, supplies, labor and services. The extent to which our financial condition and results of operations will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or any future health crisis will depend on various factors, many of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the subject virus and any government policies and restrictions implements in reaction to such virus. 
 
 Our commitments and disclosures related to sustainability expose us to numerous risks. 
 
 We have made, and will continue to make, commitments and disclosures related to sustainability matters. The Company published an inaugural Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB and Global Reporting Initiative GRI inaugural report in 2022 and plans to publish an inaugural sustainability report in the first half of 2023. Statements related to sustainability goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include: (1) the extent our customers' decisions directly impact, relate to, or influence the use of our equipment that creates the emissions we report, (2) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (3) evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures, (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting such metrics, including sustainability-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. Changes in such standards may also require us to alter our accounting or operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems to reflect new reporting obligations. Our business may also face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Financial Risks: 
 
 Our Debt Facilities, as defined below, contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities. 
 
 25 

Our Credit Facility and Second Lien (collectively Debt Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things: 
 
 sell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiary; 
 redeem our debt; 
 make investments; 
 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; 
 create or incur certain liens; 
 make certain acquisitions and investments; 
 redeem or prepay other debt; 
 enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiary to us; 
 consolidate, divide, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; 
 engage in transactions with affiliates; 
 create unrestricted subsidiaries; 
 enter into swap agreements beyond certain maximum thresholds; 
 enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and 
 engage in certain business activities. 
 
 As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. 
 
 Our ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if oil and natural gas prices decline further from their current level or remain volatile for an extended period of time, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Debt Facilities or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our Debt Facilities or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If an event of default under either of our Debt Facilities occurs and remains uncured, the lenders or holders under the applicable Credit Facility: 
 
 would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; 
 could elect to declare all borrowings or notes outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; 
 may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings or notes; or 
 may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements. 
 
 The borrowing base under our Credit Facility is redetermined at least semi-annually, based in part on methodologies and assumptions of the administrative agent with respect to, among other things, crude oil and natural gas prices and advancement rates for proved reserves. In November 2022, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at 775 million as part of our regularly scheduled redetermination. In contrast, a negative adjustment to the borrowing base could occur if crude oil and natural gas prices used by the lenders are significantly lower than those used in the last redetermination, including as result of a decline in commodity prices or an expectation that reduced prices will continue. Further, changes in lenders' methodologies related to advancement rates for proved reserves could significantly affect our borrowing base. The next redetermination of our borrowing base is scheduled to occur in spring of 2023. As of February 28, 2023, we had 543 million outstanding under our Credit Facility. In the event that the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings. In addition, the portion of our borrowing base made available to us for borrowing is subject to the terms and covenants of our Credit Facility, including compliance with the ratios and other financial covenants of such facility. 
 
 Our obligations under the Debt Facilities are collateralized by first and second priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets, including mortgage liens on oil and natural gas properties having at least 85 of the PV-9 (determined using commodity price assumptions by the administrative agent of the Credit Facility) of the borrowing base properties (with respect to the Credit Facility) or the oil and gas properties constituting proved reserves as set forth in the most recent reserve report (with respect to the Second Lien). If we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Debt Facilities, (including any amount of borrowings in excess of the borrowing base resulting from a redetermination of our Credit Facility), the lenders could seek to foreclose on substantially all our assets. 
 
 26 

We have written down the carrying values on our oil and natural gas properties in the past and could incur additional write-downs in the future. 
 
 SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the ceiling test ). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. If oil and natural gas prices remain low for an extended period of time, we could be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of our oil and gas properties. For example, due to the effects of pricing and timing of projects we reported a non-cash impairment write-down, on a pre-tax basis, of 355.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. While the demand for and price of oil and natural gas has generally recovered from the lows experienced in 2020, if future capital expenditures outpace future discounted net cash flow in our reserve calculations, if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes (which also reduces our estimate of discounted future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves) or if oil or natural gas prices decline, it is possible that non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties will occur again in the future. We cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be; therefore, we cannot estimate the amount of any potential future non-cash write-down of our oil and natural gas properties due to decreases in oil or natural gas prices. However, it is reasonably possible that we will record additional ceiling test write-downs in future periods. Refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation. 
 
 A worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may impact our counterparties and have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict. 
 
 We may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and a worldwide economic downturn. 
 
 Our future results may be impacted by a worldwide economic downturn, continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, changes in interest rates, continued high inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business. Such circumstances may increase the credit and performance risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Additionally, our assessment of these counterparty risks is hindered by swings in the financial markets. The same circumstances may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have. 
 
 The global economic environment, including high inflation and continued increases in interest rates, may also adversely impact our future access to capital. Tightening credit markets have affected, and may continue to affect, the oil and gas markets more strongly than other industries. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity 
 
 Due to the above-listed factors, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms. 
 
 Our hedging program may limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices, result in losses, or be inadequate to protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in commodity prices. 
 
 We enter into arrangements to hedge a portion of our production from time to time to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. As of December 31, 2022, we were over 50 hedged in both oil and gas production over the next 24 months consistent with the covenant under our Debt Facilities. Our hedges were in the form of collars, swaps, put and call options, basis swaps, and other structures placed with the commodity trading branches of certain national banking institutions and with certain other commodity trading groups. These hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the market or spot prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We cannot be certain that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from continuing volatility or prolonged declines in oil and natural gas prices. To the extent that oil and natural gas prices remain volatile or decline further, we would not be able to hedge future production at the same pricing level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. 
 
 In addition, our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract, particularly during periods of falling commodity prices. Disruptions in the financial markets or other factors outside our control could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty s creditworthiness or ability to perform, and even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending on 
 27 

market conditions at the time. If the creditworthiness of any of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks: 
 
 Pollution and property contamination arising from the Company s operations and the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators could expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities. 
 
 The performance of the Company s operations may result in significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater or other fluid discharges related to operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Spills or other unauthorized releases of regulated substances by or resulting from the Company s operations, or the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators, could expose the Company to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Certain of the properties upon which the Company conducts operations were acquired from third parties, whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes at or from such properties were not under the Company s control. Moreover, certain of these laws may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations the Company could be exposed to liability as a result of the Company s conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims against the Company for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of pollutants into the environment. New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement relating to environmental requirements may occur, resulting in the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of new or expanded projects, or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Any of these developments could require the Company to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general in addition to the Company s own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The Company may not be able to recover some or any of its costs with respect to such developments from insurance. 
 
 Government regulation of the Company s activities could adversely affect the Company and its operations. 
 
 The oil and natural gas business is subject to extensive governmental regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from oil and natural gas wells may be regulated. Governmental regulation also may affect the market for the Company s production and operations. Costs of compliance with governmental regulation are significant, and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect the results of the Company. Numerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. We cannot predict the timing or impact of new or changed laws, regulations, or permit requirements or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations, or permit requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. For example, various governmental agencies, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, the federal Bureau of Land Management BLM ), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can enact or change, begin to enforce compliance with, or otherwise modify their enforcement, interpretation or administration of, certain regulations that could adversely affect the Company. Additionally, the current presidential administration may increase the likelihood of potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any existing legislation or directives by government authorities. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on the Company, its operations, the demand for oil and natural gas, or the prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted into law or adopted and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company s operations are subject to environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities and could delay the pace or restrict the scope of the Company s operations. 
 
 The Company s oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA, OSHA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, which may require the Company to take actions resulting in costly capital and operating expenditures at its wells and properties. These laws and 
 28 

regulations may restrict or affect the Company s business in many ways, including applying specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, requiring the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activities commence, restricting the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, limiting or prohibiting construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigative, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of the Company s operations in a particular area. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though the conduct in pursuing the Company s operations was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by prior operators or other third-parties 
 
 Over time, environmental laws and regulations in the United States protecting the environment generally have become more stringent and are expected to continue to do so in the future. If existing environmental regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, the Company may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures with respect to its continued operations. Moreover, these risks are likely to be enhanced under the current presidential administration. Examples of recent environmental regulations include the following: 
 
 Ground-Level Ozone Standards . In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard NAAQS for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company s equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Company's capital expenditures and operating costs arising from the program s operations. 
 
 EPA Review of Drilling Waste Classification . Drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the RCRA and instead, are regulated under RCRA s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any future loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the Company s costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on the Company s business. 
 
 Federal Jurisdiction over Waters of the United States . In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Corps under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act, over waters of the United States, including wetlands. However, the EPA rescinded this rule in 2019 and promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule in 2020. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule defined what waters qualify as navigable waters of the United States and are under Clean Water Act jurisdiction. This new rule has generally been viewed as narrowing the scope of waters of the United States as compared to the 2015 rule, but litigation in multiple federal district courts is currently challenging the rescission of the 2015 rule and the promulgation of the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. In June 2021, the Biden Administration announced plans to develop its own definition for jurisdictional waters, and in August 2021, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order striking down the Navigable Water Protection Rule. On December 7, 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army announced a proposed rule to revise the definition of waters of the United States, which would return to the 2015 definition of waters of the United States, updated to reflect consideration of Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the scope of the Clean Water Act again in Sackett v. EPA. To the extent that a revised rule or Supreme Court decision expands the scope of the Clean Water Act s jurisdiction in areas where the Company conducts operations, the Company could incur increased costs and restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or projects, which developments could expose it to significant costs and liabilities. 
 
 Additionally, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and analogous state occupational safety and health laws require the program manager to organize information about materials, some of which may be hazardous or toxic, that are used, released or produced in the Company s operations. Moreover, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community 
 29 

right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company s operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 
 Compliance of the Company with these regulations or other laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental and occupational health and safety legal requirements could, among other things, require the Company to install new or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur significantly increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Moreover, any failure of the Company s operations to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against the Company that could adversely impact its operations and financial condition. 
 
 The ESA and other restrictions intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our oil and natural gas operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our ability to explore for and develop new oil and natural gas wells. 
 
 The ESA and comparable state laws and other regulatory initiatives restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Some of the Company s operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species and, in these areas, the Company may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and the Company may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when its operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to the Company s drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, may make determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered or the redesignation of lesser protected species in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations or cancellations on its exploration and production activities, which costs, delays, limitations or cancellations could have an adverse impact on the Company s ability to develop and produce reserves. If the Company were to have a portion of its leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of its leases. 
 
 Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect the Company s production. 
 
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Company uses hydraulic fracturing techniques in certain of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted studies or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA Underground Injection Control UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also issued final regulations in 2012 and in 2016 under the CAA that govern performance standards, including standards for the capture of methane and volatile organic compound VOC air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. While the EPA rescinded parts of the 2016 regulations in 2020, they were subsequently reinstated in July 2021. In November 2021, the EPA expanded upon the performance standards to impose more stringent methane and volatile organic compound emission standards for new, reconstructed and modified sources in the oil and natural gas industry and to create guidelines for existing oil and natural gas sources to be included in individual states' implementation plans. Additionally, in December 2022, the EPA issued a supplemental proposal to further expand the standards. Moreover, the EPA has published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the BLM published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM s decision to rescind the 2015 rule remains pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 
 30 

From time to time, legislation has been considered, but not adopted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Moreover, these risks are likely to be enhanced under the current presidential administration. Additionally, a bill was introduced in the Senate on January 28, 2020 that, if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025. 
 
 In addition, certain states, including Texas where we conduct operations, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to place certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local laws, regulations, presidential executive orders or other legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Company operates, the Company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience restrictions, delays or cancellation in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 
 
 Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to added restrictions, delays or cancellations with respect to our operations or increased operating costs in our production of oil and natural gas. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations restricting or banning some or all of hydraulic fracturing could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and prohibit or make more difficult or costly the performance of hydraulic fracturing. These developments could adversely affect demand for our production and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 
 Federal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the Company s production of oil and natural gas. 
 
 Operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for construction and operation of such disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and produced water disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas, where the Company conducts operations, as one of six states with more significant rates of induced seismicity. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that this rate has decreased in Texas, although concern continues to exist over earthquakes arising from induced seismic activities. 
 
 In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for produced water disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In Texas, the Railroad Commission of Texas has adopted similar rules for the permitting of produced water disposal wells. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells in connection with Company activities to dispose of produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in the Company having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require third party disposal well operators the Company may engage to dispose of produced water generated by Company activities to shut down disposal wells, which development could adversely affect the Company s production or result in the Company incurring increased costs and delays with respect to Company operations.

The Company s operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could increase operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas the Company produces. 
 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations, as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. 
 
 At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement CAA emission standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The EPA has also proposed strict new methane emission regulations for certain oil and gas facilities. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Although the Trump Administration had withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the Biden Administration officially reentered the United States into the agreement in February 2021 and committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 from 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the United States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30 by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. 
 
 President Biden and the Democratic Party have identified climate change as a priority, and it is possible that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will continue to be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA ), which, among other things, contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which could increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. The IRA also establishes a charge on methane emissions above certain limits from the same facilities. Additionally, in January 2021, President Biden signed an executive order that, among other things, instructed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices. In August 2022, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against the pause of oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters of the 13 plaintiff states that brought the lawsuit, which followed a June 2021 nationwide preliminary injunction by the district court that was subsequently vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 
 President Biden s executive order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments, and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigation, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 
 
 32 

There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related investments. Institutional investors who provide capital to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability issues, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending and investment practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy could restrict the availability of capital, resulting in the restriction, delay, or cancellation of development and production activities. 
 
 The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could require the Company to incur increased operating costs or costs of compliance and thereby reduce demand for the oil and natural gas produced by the Company. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in the Company restricting or cancelling development or production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climate changes, or impairing its ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for or lower the value of, the oil and natural gas the Company produces. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations. For example, our exploration and development activities and ability to transport our production to market could be adversely affected, as these events could cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time, the Company has not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social, or physical impacts of climate change on the Company s operations. 
 
 Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, or the interpretation or application thereof. From time to time, U.S. and foreign tax authorities, including state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the IRA, which includes several provisions that are specifically applicable to corporations. The IRA includes an annual 15 minimum tax on corporations that have average annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of 1 billion over a three year period. The IRA also includes a 1 tax on publicly traded corporations on the fair market value of stock repurchased during any taxable year. Such tax applies to the extent such buybacks exceed 1 million during such year, which buyback value may be offset by other stock issuances. 
 
 Further, the U.S. Congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals, and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain, the current proposals, if enacted, could have a material effect on our effective tax rate. Additionally, in recent years, lawmakers and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have proposed certain significant changes to U.S. tax laws applicable to oil and gas companies. These changes include, but are not limited to; (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. This legislation or any future similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as any similar changes in state law, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and production, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards NOLs to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flow. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had federal NOLs of approximately 616.1 million, approximately 274.2 million of which will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2033 through 2037. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
 33 

(the Code ), imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its NOLs if it experiences an ownership change (as determined under Section 382 of the Code). Generally, an ownership change occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders), each of whom is deemed to own five percent or more in value of a corporation s stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, utilization of the NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. We believe we had an ownership change in August 2022 and, therefore, are subject to an annual limitation on the usage of our NOLs generated prior to the ownership change. However, we do not expect to have any of our NOLs expire before becoming available to be utilized by the Company. Management will continue to monitor the potential impact of Section 382 with respect to our NOLs. Additional changes in our future stock ownership or future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected. 
 
 Legal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations. 
 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, environmental or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters, if appropriate. 
 
 Because we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flow. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. 
 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock: 
 
 There may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. 
 
 Funds associated with Strategic Value Partners LLC SVP own approximately 18.8 , of our outstanding common stock. SVP currently has a right to nominate two of our directors under our director nominating agreement described below. Our current board consists of nine directors in accordance with the Bylaws, as defined below, and existing terms of the director nomination agreement. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with SVP, a former holder of our senior notes that provides for continuing nomination rights of two directors subject to conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders. For example, this concentration of ownership may limit our other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters, as our significant stockholders are able to influence matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, changes to our organizational documents and approval of acquisition offers and other significant corporate transactions. 
 
 Certain provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial. 
 
 Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, effective April 22, 2016 the Charter ), and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective October 31, 2022 (the Bylaws ), and our existing director nomination agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Charter and Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement include, among other things, those that: 
 
 provide for a classified board of directors; 
 authorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval; 
 establish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings; 
 provide SVP the right to nominate up to two of our directors; and 
 limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; 
 34 

While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with SVP, a former holder of our senior notes that provides for continuing nomination rights of two directors subject to conditions on share ownership. 
 
 Additionally, on September 20, 2022, the Board adopted a stockholder rights agreement, dated as of September 20, 2022, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (the Rights Agreement ), and declared a dividend distribution of one right (each, a Right and together with all such rights distributed or issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Rights for each outstanding share of Company common stock to holders of record on October 5, 2022. In the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the Company s then-outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, each Right would entitle its holder (other than such person or members of such group) to purchase additional shares of Company common stock at a substantial discount to the public market price. In addition, at any time after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, the Board may direct the Company to exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or certain related parties, which will have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right (subject to adjustment). While in effect, the Rights Agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company or a large block of the common stock of the Company without the approval of the Board. The Rights Agreement will expire on the earliest of (a) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first business day after the 2023 annual stockholders meeting, (b) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 30, 2023, (c) the time at which the Rights are redeemed and (d) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full. 
 
 Our Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 
 Our Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Charter or our Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. 
 
 The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
 The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation or similar governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable, including with respect to claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws. 
 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Company's financial information and its audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, included in this Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements; see Forward-Looking Statements on page 4 of this report. 

The following table and discussion highlights SilverBow's drilling and completion schedule for 2022: 
 Operating Areas Net Acreage 2022 Production (Mcfe/d) Gas as of 2022 Production 2022 Net Wells Drilled 2022 Net Wells Completed Webb County Gas 12,943 139,419 100 24 20 Western Condensate 30,844 49,359 40 7 7 Southern Eagle Ford 52,135 33,877 80 1 Central Oil 66,759 37,472 14 14 10 Eastern Extension 17,306 8,723 27 Other (1) 
 905 29 1 Total 179,987 269,755 72 45 39 
 (1) Other includes non-core properties. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company drilled 15 net wells, completed 13 net wells and brought 11 net wells online. For the full year, SilverBow drilled 45 net wells, and completed 39 net wells and brought online 37 net wells. 
 
 SilverBow operated one drilling rig for the first six months of 2022, primarily focused on its Webb County Gas area. Then, in conjunction with closing the Sundance acquisition on June 30, 2022, the Company added a second drilling rig and continued operating at a two-rig drilling pace through the end of 2022. SilverBow targeted both oil and gas opportunities throughout the second half of the year, and in the fourth quarter of 2022 operated both rigs in its Webb County Gas area. The Company expects to remain operationally flexible going forward and will continue to optimize its drilling program in response to commodity prices and expected returns. 
 
 In the Webb County Gas area, SilverBow drilled 24 net wells and completed and brought 20 net wells online during 2022. The Austin Chalk formation was a key focus area of the Company's delineation and development plan, and comprised 15 of the 24 net wells drilled in the area during 2022. Well performance in the Webb County Austin Chalk continues to exceed expectations and exhibit strong commercial economics, and during the third quarter of 2022, SilverBow completed and brought online its best performing Austin Chalk well to date with a 30-day average production of 17 MMcf/d (100 gas). In 2022, the Company drilled and completed multi-well pads that targeted both the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations, which supported SilverBow's expectations for high rate of return potential in full-scale development mode, and marks a progression from the single well delineation pads targeting the Austin Chalk in prior years. Additionally, the Company focused on expanding its Webb County and Austin Chalk position during the year with the establishment of a new acreage block within Webb County, comprising approximately 7,500 net acres through a series of bolt-on acquisitions, leasing and drill-to-earn agreements. 
 
 For the full year 2022, SilverBow's capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, on an accrual basis were 327.5 million, below the midpoint of the Company's full year guidance range of 320 to 340 million. Throughout 2022, the Company experienced inflationary pressures on its capital and operating expenses as a result of high demand for products, materials and services provided by vendors in conjunction with overall supply chain disruptions and tight labor market conditions. The SilverBow team proactively took actions to mitigate the impact of these inflationary cost pressures through enhanced procurement initiatives, pre-ordering of key materials and a focus on operational efficiencies and planning. The mid-year increase from one drilling rig to two drilling rigs supported increased scale and achieved even better overall cycle-times. This enhanced activity provided greater line of sight to secure available service equipment at favorable contract rates. In aggregate, the Company's D C costs during the year were within 1 of planned costs for the year due to the cost mitigation efforts and operational efficiencies delivered by the team. 
 
 SilverBow closed four acquisitions in 2022. The acquired assets provide SilverBow a deep runway of future oil and gas development locations in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk. The Company added more than 350 gross drilling locations from acquired assets in 2022, with further inventory upside potential based on optimizations of well costs, spacing and lateral lengths 
 41 

given the highly contiguous leasehold footprints with SilverBow's existing acreage. The acquisition activity in 2022 reflects a continued focus on identifying opportunities to add to core positions in high-return areas. 
 
 For 2023, SilverBow's capital budget is expected to be in the range of 450- 475 million. The Company expects to operate two drilling rigs throughout 2023 with approximately 90 of D C activity directed towards oil development across its Central Oil, Eastern Extension and Western Condensate areas. During the fourth quarter of 2022 and extending into the first quarter of 2023, SilverBow has experienced capacity constraints and higher basis differentials in Webb County. This has been driven by a substantial increase in regional dry gas production during 2022 combined with reduced regional export capacity. Maintaining a flexible drilling program and balanced commodity mix has been, and will continue to be, a core tenet of the Company's business strategy, and the acquisitions made in 2021 and 2022 have significantly increased SilverBow's proved oil reserves, oil drilling inventory and oil production base. Taken altogether, the Company expects to see the highest near-term returns from a oil development program which is expected to drive full year 2023 oil production approximately 100 higher year-over-year and total equivalent production approximately 25 higher year-over-year. The focus on high return oil development is expected to also drive an increase in cash margins per Mcfe, with liquids production expected to comprise approximately 45 of total production by year-end 2023 as compared to 28 for full year 2022. SilverBow's first quarter 2023 and full year 2023 production guidance assume that gas production from Webb County is limited to contracted firm capacity.

Summary of 2022 Financial Results 
 
 Revenues and net income (loss): The Company's oil and gas revenues were 753.4 million and 407.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenues were higher due to increased production volumes and overall higher commodity pricing. The Company had net income of 340.4 million and 86.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher revenues due to increased production volumes and higher commodity pricing. 
 
 Capital expenditures: The Company's capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) on an accrual basis were 327.5 million and 130.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were primarily driven by continued legacy development. These expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 
 Acquisitions: The Company closed four notable acquisitions during 2022. These acquisitions, in aggregate, added 3,800 Bbls/d of liquids and 14 MMcf/d to SilverBow s full year 2022 net production. This represents 14 of the Company's full year 2022 net production. SilverBow expects these acquisitions to comprise a greater percentage of its full year 2023 net production with a full year's contribution. In total the Company paid 367.0 million in cash and issued 156.3 million in equity related to these transactions. 
 
 Working capital: The Company had a working capital deficit of 50.1 million and 65.8 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The working capital computation does not include available liquidity through our Credit Facility. 
 
 Cash Flow: For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated cash from operating activities of 331.2 million which included negative impacts attributable to changes in working capital of 16.0 million. Cash used for property additions was 272.4 million and cash used in property acquisitions, including purchase price adjustments, was 367.0 million. This excluded 54.4 million attributable to a net increase of capital related payables and accrued costs. The Company s net borrowings under its revolving Credit Facility were 315.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated cash from operating activities of 215.7 million, which included negative impacts attributable to changes in working capital of 6.2 million. Cash used for property additions was 133.6 million. This included 4.0 million attributable to a net decrease of capital related to payables and accrued costs. The Company's net repayments under its Credit Facility were 3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayments under its Second Lien Facility were 50.0 million. The Company sold shares of common stock related to our ATM Program for net proceeds of 27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 SilverBow's primary use of cash has been to fund capital expenditures to develop its oil and gas properties, fund acquisitions and to re-pay Credit Facility borrowings. The Company uses cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under its Credit Facility as its primary source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, SilverBow s liquidity consisted of approximately 0.8 million of cash-on-hand and 233.0 million in available borrowings on its Credit Facility, which had a 775.0 million borrowing base. The Company's 2023 capital budget, which is expected to be in the range of 450- 475 million, provides for drilling 60 gross (52 net) horizontal wells and is expected to be funded primarily from operating cash flow. Management believes SilverBow has robust liquidity to meet all near term obligations and execute its longer term development plans. See Note 4 to SilverBow's consolidated financial statements for more information on its Debt Facilities. 

43 

Contractual Commitments and Obligations 
 
 We generally expect to fund contractual commitments with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our Credit Facility. These commitments and obligations for the next five years and thereafter are shown below as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 
 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Non-cancelable operating leases 8,939 1,913 934 779 51 488 13,105 Gas transportation and processing (1)

 (1) Amounts shown represent fees for the minimum delivery obligations. Any amount of transportation utilized in excess of the minimum will reduce future year obligations. The Company's production and reserves are currently sufficient to fulfill the current minimum delivery obligations. 
 (2) Interest on our Credit Facility is estimated using the weighted average interest rate of 7.24 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, while interest on our Second Lien is estimated using LIBOR plus 7.5 . See Note 4 of these consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for more information. Actual interest rate is variable over the term of the facility. 
 (3) Amounts shown represent commitments for pipe inventory purchase. 
 
 Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
 
 During 2022, our reserves increased by approximately 818.9 Bcfe due to increases in our natural gas reserves primarily from our Webb County Gas area and contributions from acquisitions closed in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 43 of our total proved reserves were proved developed, compared with 46 at year-end for both 2021 and 2020. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our proved reserves were 2,234.6 Bcfe with a Standardized Measure of 4.0 billion, which is an increase of approximately 2.5 billion, or 159 , from the prior year-end levels. In 2022, our proved natural gas reserves increased 570.2 Bcf, or 49 , while our proved oil reserves increased 27.9 MMBbl, or 115 , and our NGL reserves increased 13.6 MMBbl, or 71 , for a total equivalent increase of 818.9 Bcfe, or 58 . 
 
 We have added proved reserves primarily through our drilling activities and acquisitions, including 567.2 Bcfe added in 2022. We obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserve additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this area. 
 
 We use the preceding 12-month's average price based on closing prices on the first business day of each month, adjusted for price differentials, in calculating our average prices used in the Standardized Measure calculation. Our average natural gas price used in the Standardized Measure calculation for 2022 was 6.14 per Mcf. This average price increased from the average price of 3.75 per Mcf used for 2021. Our average oil price used in the calculation for 2022 was 94.36 per Bbl. This average price increased from the average price of 63.98 per Bbl used in the calculation for 2021. Our average NGL price used in the calculation for 2022 was 34.76 per Bbl. This average price increased from the average price of 25.29 per Bbl used in the calculation for 2021.

Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 2022 - Our oil and gas sales in 2022 increased by 85 compared to revenues in 2021, primarily due to overall higher commodity pricing and higher production volumes. Average oil prices we received were 35 higher than those received during 2021, while natural gas prices were 44 higher and NGL prices were 15 higher. 
 
 Crude oil production was 16 and 11 of our production volumes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while crude oil sales revenues were 32 and 24 of oil and gas sales revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Natural gas production was 72 and 77 of our production volumes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while natural gas sales revenues were 60 and 66 of oil and gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 NGL production was 12 of our production volumes for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while NGL sales were 8 and 10 of oil and gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The following tables provide information regarding the changes in the sources of our oil and gas sales and volumes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Fields Oil and Gas Sales (In Millions) Net Oil and Gas Production Volumes (MMcfe) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Webb County Gas 325.0 194.6 50,888 42,955 Western Condensate 147.9 110.7 18,016 17,922 Southern Eagle Ford 80.2 40.8 12,365 9,858 Central Oil 165.4 53.7 13,677 6,300 Eastern Extension 32.8 3.8 3,184 455 Non-Core 2.1 3.6 330 623 Total 753.4 407.2 98,460 78,113 
 
 SilverBow's sales volume increase from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to higher production volumes across all products, driven by full year contribution from acquisitions closed in 2021 and partial year contribution from acquisitions closed in 2022. Additionally, the Company increased its drilling activity from 2021 to 2022, resulting in 37 net wells brought online in 2022 compared to 24 net wells brought online in 2021. 
 
 In 2022, our 346.2 million, or 85 , increase in oil, NGL, and natural gas sales resulted from: 
 
 Volume variances that had a 138.6 million favorable impact on sales, with a 79.1 million increase due to the 1.2 million Bbl increase in oil production volumes, a 46.2 million increase due to the 10.4 Bcf increase in natural gas production volumes and a 13.3 million increase due to the 0.5 million Bbl increase in NGL production volumes. 
 Price variances that had a 207.7 million favorable impact on sales, with an increase of 138.0 million due to the 44 increase in natural gas prices received, an increase of 61.6 million due to the 35 increase in oil prices received and an increase of 8.1 million due to the 15 increase in NGL prices received.

Costs and Expenses 
 
 The following table provides additional information regarding our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Costs and Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 General and administrative, net 21,395 21,799 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 133,982 68,629 Accretion of asset retirement obligation 534 306 Lease operating expenses 55,329 27,206 Workovers 1,655 514 Transportation and gas processing 32,989 24,145 Severance and other taxes 41,761 19,307 Interest expense, net 41,948 29,129 Provision for income taxes 9,600 6,398 
 
 Our costs and expenses during 2022 versus 2021 were as follows: 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses, Net. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were 0.22 and 0.28 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease per Mcfe was due to an overall increase in production driven by our acquisitions. Included in general and administrative expenses is 5.1 million and 4.6 million in share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD A ). These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were 1.36 and 0.88 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our per-Mcfe depreciation, depletion and amortization rate was primarily related to acquisitions in the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022 and inflation on future development costs. The increase in costs is related to the increase in the per-Mcfe rate, coupled with an overall increase in production. 
 
 Lease Operating Expenses. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were 0.58 and 0.35 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in costs is due to higher compression, labor, salt water disposal and chemical costs driven by our acquisitions in the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022. 
 
 Transportation and gas processing. These expenses all related to natural gas and NGL sales. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were 0.34 and 0.31 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Severance and Other Taxes. These expenses on a per Mcfe basis were 0.42 and 0.25 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Severance and other taxes, as a percentage of oil and gas sales, were approximately 5.5 and 4.7 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Interest Expense. Our gross interest expense was 41.9 million and 29.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in gross interest was primarily due to higher borrowings. There was no capitalized interest for both of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 which was primarily attributable to federal and state deferred taxes of 75.8 million on income before taxes of 350.0 million, 1.4 million of non-deductible expenses, partially offset by a benefit for the release of its 67.6 million valuation allowance. In March and April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused volatility in the market price for crude oil due to the disruption of global supply and demand. In response to these market conditions and given the decline in oil prices and economic outlook for the Company, management determined that it was not more likely than not that the Company would realize future cash benefits from its remaining federal carryover items and other deferred tax assets and, accordingly, recorded a full valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2020 to offset its net deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company's management determined there was sufficient positive evidence that indicated the Company would more likely than not be able to fully utilize its deferred tax assets and as a result, removed the full valuation allowance of 67.6 million. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily attributable to deferred federal income tax expense.

Critical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Property and Equipment. We follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs. Under this method of accounting, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration, development, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar activities. Future development costs are estimated on a property-by-property basis based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized. We compute the provision for DD A of oil and natural gas properties using the unit-of-production method. 
 
 The costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly, on a property-by-property basis, to determine whether such properties have been impaired. In determining whether such costs should be impaired, we evaluate current drilling results, lease expiration dates, current oil and gas industry conditions, international economic conditions, capital availability, and available geological and geophysical information. As these factors may change from period to period, our evaluation of these factors will change. Any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized. 
 
 The calculation of the provision for DD A requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. These inputs and assumptions all require a high degree of subjectivity and could have a material impact on the overall estimate of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes and associated future cash flows and the related measurement of DD A expense or the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
 
 Full-Cost Ceiling Test . At the end of each quarterly reporting period, the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties (including natural gas processing facilities, capitalized asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes, and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability) is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties (excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations, including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled, using the preceding 12-months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month, adjusted for price differentials, discounted at 10 , and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties) adjusted for related income tax effects. At December 31, 2022, the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for related income tax effects exceeded our unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties by approximately 2.7 billion. 
 
 We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates. 
 
 If future capital expenditures outpace future discounted net cash flow in our reserve calculations, if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes (which also reduces our estimate of discounted future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves) or if oil or natural gas prices remain depressed or continue to decline, it is possible that non-cash write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties will occur in the future. We cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be, thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non-cash write-down of our oil and natural gas properties due to decreases in oil or natural gas prices. 
 
 Income taxes . Our provision for income taxes includes U.S. state and federal taxes. We record our income tax provision in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. 
 
 We apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes. The actual outcome of future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates, which could impact our financial position, 
 48 

results of operations and cash flows. We record adjustments to reflect actual taxes paid in the period we complete our tax returns. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements . In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables. The new standard replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forward-looking information to estimate all expected credit losses. The updated guidance is effective for the Company for annual and quarterly reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or disclosures. 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting followed by ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope ASU 2021-01 ), issued in January 2021. The guidance provides and clarifies optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments within these ASUs were in effect beginning March 12, 2020, and an entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not elected to use the optional guidance and continues to evaluate the options provided by ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01. 
 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. The guidance simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity. Additionally, the amendment requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share (EPS). The guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or disclosures.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Commodity Risk . Our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas. This commodity pricing volatility has continued with unpredictable price swings in recent periods. 
 
 Our price-risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments (such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and options contracts) to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our Credit Facility. For additional discussion related to our price-risk management policy, refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Customer Credit Risk. We are exposed to the risk of financial non-performance by customers. Our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base. Continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base. To manage customer credit risk, we monitor credit ratings of customers and from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit, parent company guarantees if applicable, and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss. Due to availability of other purchasers, we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Concentration of Sales Risk. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 22 , 11 , 14 and 12 of our oil and gas receipts were accounted for by Kinder Morgan, Inc. Kinder Morgan ), Plains Marketing, LP Plains Marketing ), Trafigura US, Inc Trafigura and Shell Trading Shell Trading ). There were no other purchasers who individually accounted for 10 or more of our oil and gas receipts. We expect to continue these relationships in the future. We believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size, reputation and nature of the businesses and the availability of other purchasers in the areas where we operate. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2022, we had a combined 692.0 million drawn under our Credit Facility and our Second Lien Notes, which bear a floating rate of interest depending on the level of the borrowing base and the borrowing base loans outstanding and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. These variable interest rate borrowings are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. A hypothetical one-percentage point increase in interest rates on our borrowings outstanding under our Debt Facilities at December 31, 2022 would increase our annual interest expense by 6.9 million.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated March 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Estimation and Impact on Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD A Expense and Full-Cost Ceiling Test Impairment Calculation Related to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
 As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, proved oil and natural gas reserves volumes and associated future net cash flows directly impact the calculation of DD A expense and the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves volumes and associated future net cash flows including, among others, estimated future production volumes and timing of such production, pricing differentials, lease operating expenses, and amounts and timing of capital expenditures. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The estimation of oil and natural gas reserve volumes and associated future net cash flows requires management s use of internal petroleum engineers and independent petroleum engineers and geologists (referred to as management s specialists ). 
 54 

We have identified the estimation and timing of future production volumes, lease operating expenses, and amounts and timing of future capital expenditures used to estimate oil and natural gas reserves, and the associated impact on DD A expense and the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation related to proved oil and natural gas properties as a critical audit matter. These inputs and assumptions all require a high degree of subjectivity and could have a material impact on the overall estimate of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes and associated future cash flows and the related measurement of DD A expense or the full-cost ceiling test impairment calculation. Auditing management s judgment with respect to these inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment in the design of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the audit evidence obtained. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to management s estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Evaluating the professional qualifications of management s specialists and their relationship to the Company, making inquiries of management s specialists regarding the process followed and judgments used to assist in estimating the Company s proved oil and natural gas reserves, and reading the report prepared by the independent petroleum engineers and geologists. 
 Comparing estimated production volumes and production decline analyses for certain fields against results of actual production volumes and actual production decline analyses to determine the appropriateness of management s estimates. 
 Evaluating the estimates of lease operating expenses used in the reserve estimates compared to historical lease operating expenses. 
 Comparing the estimates of future capital expenditures used in the reserve estimates for certain fields to amounts expended for recently drilled and completed wells in similar locations. 
 Evaluating the Company s evidence to support the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve estimates by examining historical conversion rates and support for the Company s intent and ability to develop the proved undeveloped properties. 
 Evaluating management s estimates of oil and natural gas reserve volumes, lease operating expenses and future capital expenditures against evidence obtained in other areas of the audit for consistency and reasonableness.

Stockholder Rights Agreement . On September 20, 2022, the Board adopted a stockholder rights agreement, dated as of September 20, 2022, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent (the Rights Agreement ), and declared a dividend distribution of one right (each, a Right and together with all such rights distributed or issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Rights for each outstanding share of Company common stock to holders of record on October 5, 2022. In the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s then-outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, each Right would entitle its holder (other than such person or members of such group) to purchase additional shares of Company common stock at a substantial discount to the public market price. In addition, at any time after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, the Board may direct the Company to exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or certain related parties, which will have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right (subject to adjustment). While in effect, the Rights Agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company or a large block of the common stock of the Company without the approval of the Board. The Rights Agreement will expire on the earliest of (a) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first business day after the 2023 annual stockholders meeting, (b) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 30, 2023, (c) the time at which the Rights are redeemed and (d) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full.

years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
 
 Geological and geophysical G G costs incurred on developed properties are recorded in Proved oil and gas properties and therefore subject to amortization. G G costs incurred that are associated with unproved properties are capitalized in Unproved oil and gas properties and evaluated as part of the total capitalized costs associated with a prospect. The cost of unproved properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly, on a property-by-property basis, to determine whether such properties have been impaired. In determining whether such costs should be impaired, we evaluate current drilling results, lease expiration dates, current oil and gas industry conditions, economic conditions, capital availability, and available geological and geophysical information. Any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized. 
 
 The Company evaluates each acquisition of oil and gas properties to determine whether each should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or business in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01: Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business ASU 2017-01 ). If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set of transferred assets and activities are not a business combination. 
 
 A business combination may result in the recognition of a bargain purchase gain or goodwill based on the measurement of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred, adjusted for purchase price adjustments. The initial accounting for business combinations may not be complete and adjustments to provisional amounts, or recognition of additional assets acquired or liabilities assumed, may occur as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates. Asset acquisitions are recorded at the cost of acquiring the property. The results of operations of the oil and gas properties acquired in the Company s acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the closing dates of the respective acquisitions. See Note 9 for further discussion on recent acquisitions. 
 
 , and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties) adjusted for related income tax effects Ceiling Test ). 
 
 The quarterly calculations of the Ceiling Test and provision for DD A are based on estimates of proved reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production, timing and plan of development. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing, and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. There was ceiling test write-down for either of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 If future capital expenditures outpace future discounted net cash flows in our reserve calculations, if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes (which also reduces our estimate of discounted future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves) or if oil or natural gas prices decline, it is possible that non-cash write-downs of our oil and

On August 13, 2021, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time in the open market, shares of the Company s common stock, having aggregate proceeds of up to million (the ATM Program ). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any sales through the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, financing of capital expenditures, repayment or refinancing of outstanding debt, financing acquisitions or investments, financing other business opportunities, and general working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2021 (from August 13, 2021 through December 31, 2021), the Company sold shares of common stock for net proceeds of million after deducting sales agents' commissions and other related expenses.

 The Company s valuation allowance balance was million at December 31, 2021. There was valuation allowance at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company s NOL carryforward asset is attributable to Federal tax losses of million generated from 2013 through 2015, million generated in 2017 and million generated from 2018 through 2022. The losses generated between 2013 and 2017 will expire between 2033 and 2037 if not utilized. The losses generated from 2018 through 2022 will not expire under the current tax code, but their usage will be limited to of taxable income. We experienced an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 during 2022 and our annual usage of losses up to the change date in 2022 may be limited; however, at this time, we do no expect any of the losses to expire unused. We generated approximately million in NOL carryforward assets in 2022, of which, million relates to the time period post ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 and is not subject to limitation. Should we experience another ownership change within the meaning of Section 382, our NOLs could be further limited.

 (1) Unamortized debt issuance costs on our Credit Facility borrowings are included in Other Long-Term Assets in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had million and million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs on our Credit Facility borrowings. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility (defined below) were million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is a party to a First Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto, as amended (such agreement, the Credit Agreement and the borrowing facility provided thereby, the Credit Facility ). In conjunction with an unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base requested by SilverBow along with its administrative agent as part of the SandPoint (as defined later) and Sundance asset acquisitions in the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective June 22, 2022 (the Tenth Amendment ), which among other things, increased the borrowing base under the Credit Facility to million from million, effective upon the closing of the Sundance acquisition on June 30, 2022; extended the maturity date for the Credit Agreement to October 19, 2026 (or to the extent earlier, the date that is 91 days prior to the scheduled maturity of the Company's Second Lien notes); increased the maximum credit amounts from billion to billion; decreased the applicable margin used to calculate the interest rate under the Credit Facility by basis points, with the specific applicable margins determined by reference to borrowing base utilization; decreased the mortgage coverage and title requirements from to ; amended the restricted payment basket allowing the Company to make dividends or other distribution or return of capital to the extent that the Company's total leverage does not exceed x and the utilization percentage as of the date of such dividend or distribution is less than after giving effect to such restricted payment; and added two new lenders as parties to the Credit Agreement. Earlier in the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective April 12, 2022, as part of the regular, semi-annual redetermination. Prior to the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment had previously, among other things, increased the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement from million to million. In conjunction with its regularly scheduled semi-annual redetermination, the Company reaffirmed the borrowing base and elected commitment amount under the Credit Facility at million, effective November 22, 2022. 
 
 Effective upon the execution of the Tenth Amendment on June 22, 2022, the Credit Facility matures October 19, 2026 (or to the extent earlier, the date that is 91 days prior to the scheduled maturity of the Company's Second Lien notes), and provides for a maximum credit amount of billion, subject to the current borrowing base of million. The borrowing base is regularly redetermined on or about May and November of each calendar year and is subject to additional adjustments from time to time, including for asset sales, elimination or reduction of hedge positions and incurrence of other debt. Additionally, the Company and the administrative agent may request an unscheduled redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled redeterminations. The amount of the borrowing base is determined by the lenders, in their discretion, in accordance with their oil and gas lending criteria at the time of the relevant redetermination. The Company may also request the issuance of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount up to million, which reduces the amount of available borrowings under the borrowing base in the amount of such issued and outstanding letters of credit. There were no outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Maintaining or increasing our borrowing base under our Credit Facility is dependent on many factors, including commodity prices, our hedge positions , changes in our lenders' lending criteria and our ability to raise capital to drill wells to replace produced reserves.

basis points and ranged from to based on borrowing base utilization for ABR Loans and to based on borrowing base utilization for Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans. The Alternate Base Rate and SOFR are defined, and the applicable margins are set forth, in the Credit Agreement. Undrawn amounts under the Credit Facility are subject to a commitment fee. To the extent that a payment default exists and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will bear interest at per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's weighted average interest rate on Credit Facility borrowings was . 
 
 The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the Company and its subsidiary, including a first priority lien on properties attributed with at least of estimated proved reserves of the Company and its subsidiary effective upon the execution of the Tenth Amendment on June 22, 2022. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains the following financial covenants: 
 
 a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters, not to exceed to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and 
 
 a current ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, which includes in the numerator available borrowings undrawn under the borrowing base, of not less than to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on incurring debt and liens, limitations on making certain restricted payments, limitations on investments, limitations on asset sales and hedge unwinds, limitations on transactions with affiliates and limitations on modifying organizational documents and material contracts. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. 
 
 Total interest expense on the Credit Facility, which includes commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs, was million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of commitment fee amortization included in interest expense, net was million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes . On December 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for Senior Secured Second Lien Notes (as amended, the Note Purchase Agreement , such second lien facility, the Second Lien and such notes, the Second Lien Notes among the Company as issuer, U.S. Bank National Association as agent and collateral agent and certain holders that are a party thereto, and issued notes in an initial principal amount of million, with a million discount, for net proceeds of million. 
 
 Effective November 12, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement, which extended the maturity date from December 15, 2024 to December 15, 2026 subject to paying down the principal amount of the Second Lien from million to million. The Company made the million redemption of the Second Lien Notes on November 29, 2021. The Company accounted for this paydown as a debt modification and incurred approximately million in third party fees in connection with the amendment. The unamortized debt issuance cost and discount on the Second Lien Notes will be amortized through the new maturity date of December 15, 2026. 
 
 Interest on the Second Lien is payable quarterly and accrues at LIBOR plus ; provided that if LIBOR ceases to be available, the Second Lien provides for a mechanism to use Alternate Base Rate plus as the applicable interest rate. The definitions of LIBOR and Alternate Base Rate are set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. To the extent that a payment, insolvency or, at the holders election, another default exists and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the Second Lien

per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto. Additionally, to the extent the Company were to default on the Second Lien, this would potentially trigger a cross-default under its Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company has the right, to the extent permitted under the Credit Facility and subject to the terms and conditions of the Second Lien, to optionally prepay the notes at no premium. Additionally, the Second Lien contains customary mandatory prepayment obligations upon asset sales (including hedge terminations), casualty events and incurrences of certain debt, subject to, in certain circumstances, reinvestment periods. Management believes the probability of mandatory prepayment due to default is remote. 
 
 The obligations under the Second Lien are secured, subject to certain exceptions and other permitted liens (including the liens created under the Credit Facility), by a perfected security interest, second in priority to the liens securing our Credit Facility, and mortgage lien on substantially all assets of the Company and its subsidiary, including a mortgage lien on oil and gas properties attributed with at least of estimated PV-9 (defined below), of proved reserves of the Company and its subsidiary and of the book value attributed to the PV-9 of the non-proved oil and gas properties of the Company. PV-9 is determined using commodity price assumptions by the administrative agent of the Credit Facility. PV-9 value is the estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves discounted to present value using an annual discount rate of . 
 
 The Second Lien contains an Asset Coverage Ratio, which is only tested (i) as a condition to issuance of additional notes and (ii) in connection with certain asset sales in order to determine whether the proceeds of such asset sale must be applied as a prepayment of the notes and includes in the numerator the PV-10 (defined below), based on forward strip pricing, plus the swap mark-to-market value of the commodity derivative contracts of the Company and its restricted subsidiary and in the denominator the total net indebtedness of the Company and its restricted subsidiary, of not less than to 1.0 as of each date of determination (the Asset Coverage Ratio ). PV-10 Value is the estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves discounted to present value using an annual discount rate of . 
 
 The Second Lien also contains a financial covenant measuring the ratio of total net debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters, not to exceed to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Second Lien. 
 
 The Second Lien contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on incurring debt and liens, limitations on making certain restricted payments, limitations on investments, limitations on asset sales and hedge unwinds, limitations on transactions with affiliates and limitations on modifying organizational documents and material contracts. The Second Lien contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding under the Second Lien to be immediately due and payable. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, net amounts recorded for the Second Lien Notes were million, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on the Second Lien totaled million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 million and million, respectively, for debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the amendments to our Credit Facility. Additionally, the Company wrote-off million and million in debt issuance costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to changes under our Credit Facility.

million and million, respectively, relating to our commodity derivative activities. The Company made net cash payments of million and million for settled derivative contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded gains of million related to valuation changes on the 2021 and 2022 WTI West Texas Intermediate Contingency Payouts. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had million and million, respectively, in receivables for settled derivatives which were included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in Accounts receivable, net and were subsequently collected in January 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also had million and million, respectively, in payables for settled derivatives which were included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and were subsequently paid in January 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The fair values of our swap contracts are computed using observable market data whereas our collar contracts are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. At December 31, 2022 there was million and million in current unsettled derivative assets and long-term unsettled derivative assets, respectively, and million and million in current unsettled derivative liabilities and long-term unsettled derivative liabilities, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Company had million and million in current unsettled derivative assets and long-term unsettled derivative assets, respectively, and million and million in current unsettled derivative liabilities and long-term unsettled derivative liabilities, respectively. 
 
 The Company uses an International Swap and Derivatives Association master agreement for our derivative contracts. This is an industry-standardized contract containing the general conditions of our derivative transactions including provisions relating to netting derivative settlement payments under certain circumstances (such as default). For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to not offset the asset and liability fair value amounts of its derivatives on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the right of set-off, there was an million net fair value asset at December 31, 2022 and million net fair value liability at December 31, 2021.

 million for 2023, million for 2024, million for 2025, million for 2026 and million in the aggregate. These gas transportation and processing minimum obligations represent gross future minimum transportation charges we are obligated to pay as of December 31, 2022. However, our financial statements will reflect our proportionate share of the charges based on our working interest and net revenue interest, which will vary from property to property. Actual transportation under these contracts may exceed the minimum commitments previously stated. The Company incurred transportation expense related to these contracts of million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we have drilling commitments amounting to million for 2023, million for 2024 and million for 2025. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are party to various legal actions, which arise primarily from our activities as operator of oil and natural gas wells. In management's opinion, the outcome of any such currently pending legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capitalized share-based compensation was million and for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 We view stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards with graded vesting as single awards with an expected life equal to the average expected life of component awards, and we amortize the awards on a straight-line basis over the life of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur. 
 
 Our shares available for future grant under the Plans were at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Stock Option Awards 
 
 The compensation cost related to these awards is based on the grant date fair value and is expensed over the vesting period (generally one to five years). We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. 
 Options exercised ) Options expired ) Options outstanding, end of period Options exercisable, end of period 
 
 Our outstanding stock option awards at December 31, 2022 had million measurable aggregate intrinsic value. At December 31, 2022 the weighted-average remaining contract life of stock option awards outstanding was years and exercisable was years. The stock option awards exercisable as of December 31, 2022 had million in intrinsic value. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 The Plans allow for the issuance of restricted stock unit awards that generally may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed. The compensation cost related to these awards is based on the grant date fair value and is typically expensed over the requisite service period (generally one to five years). 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized compensation expense of million related to our restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

 (1) Revisions of previous estimates are related to upward or downward variations based on current engineering information for production rates, volumetrics, reservoir pressure and commodity pricing. The downward revisions for 2022 include approximately 47.3 Bcfe due to performance revisions, 8.9 Bcfe due to demonstrated changes in operating expenses and 2.8 Bcfe attributable to the reclassification of PUDs to unproved due to changes in the Company's five-year development plan, partially offset by positive revision of 35.8 Bcfe due to incremental interest related to non-consent participation of a working interest partner in our Webb County Gas operating area and a Company-wide positive commodity sales price revisions of 20.5 Bcfe. The downward revisions for 2021 include approximately 170.6 Bcfe attributable to the reclassification of PUDs to unproved due to changes in the Company's five-year development plan, 62.9 Bcfe due to performance revisions, and 6.6 due to demonstrated changes in operating expenses, partially offset by Company-wide positive commodity sales price revisions of 41.7 Bcfe. 
 (2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 43 and 46 of our reserves were proved developed.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows. The Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows (in thousands):

 (1) These amounts include future costs related to plugging and abandoning the Company's wells. 
 
 The Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows from production of proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were developed as follows: 
 
 1. Estimates were made of quantities of proved reserves and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year-end economic conditions. 
 2. The estimated future gross revenues of proved reserves were based on the preceding 12-months' average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month, or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements. 
 3. The future gross revenues were reduced by estimated future costs to develop and to produce the proved reserves, including asset retirement obligation costs, based on year-end cost estimates and the estimated effect of future income taxes. 
 4. Future income taxes were computed by applying the statutory tax rate to future net cash flows reduced by the tax basis of the properties, the estimated permanent differences applicable to future oil and natural gas producing activities and tax carry forwards. 
 
 The Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows is not intended to present the fair market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices and costs, an allowance for return on investment, and the risks inherent in reserves estimates.

 ten days following a public announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person by acquiring beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the Common Stock then outstanding (or, in the case of a person that had beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the outstanding Common Stock on the date the Rights Agreement was executed, by obtaining beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock representing 0.25 of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding) other than, in each case, as a result of repurchases of Common Stock by the Company or certain inadvertent acquisitions and 
 
 ten business days (or such later date as the Board shall determine prior to the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer by or on behalf of any person (other than the Company and certain related entities) that, if completed, would result in such person becoming an Acquiring Person. 
 
 An Acquiring Person generally means a person that becomes a beneficial owner of 4.99 or more of our Common Stock, with certain limited exceptions. 
 
 The Rights will expire on the earliest of (a) 5 00 p.m., New York City time on the day after the 2023 annual shareholders meeting, (b) 5 00 p.m., New York City time, on June 30, 2023, (c) the time at which the Rights are redeemed (as described below), and (d) the time at which the Rights are exchanged in full (the earliest of (a), (b), (c) and (d) being herein referred to as the Expiration Date ). 
 
 At any time prior to the earlier of (a) a person becoming an Acquiring Person and (b) the Expiration Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the Board may direct the Company to redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of 0.01 per Right (payable in cash, Common Stock, or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Board). Immediately upon the action of the Board directing the Company to redeem the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the 0.01 redemption price. 
 
 The Company, by action of the Board, may supplement or amend any provision of the Rights Agreement in any respect without the approval of any registered holder of Rights, including, without limitation, in order to (a) cure any ambiguity, (b) correct or supplement any provision contained in the Rights Agreement that may be defective or inconsistent with other provisions of the Rights Agreement, (c) shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement, or (d) otherwise change, amend, or supplement any provisions of the Rights Agreement in any manner that the Company deems necessary or desirable provided, however, that no supplement or amendment made after a person becomes an Acquiring Person shall adversely affect the interests of the registered holders of rights certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or any affiliated or associated person of an Acquiring Person or certain of their transferees) or shall cause the Rights Agreement to become amendable other than in accordance with the amendment provision contained therein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may at any time before any person becomes an Acquiring Person amend the Rights Agreements to make provisions of the Rights Agreement inapplicable to a particular transaction by which a person might otherwise become an Acquiring Person or to otherwise alter the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement as they may apply with respect to any such transaction. 
 
 The Board may adjust the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or assets issuable upon exercise of a Right, and the number of Rights outstanding to prevent dilution that may occur (a) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination, or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (b) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision or combination of, the Common Stock, (c) if holders of the Preferred Stock are granted certain rights, options, or warrants to subscribe for Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock, or (d) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). 
 
 With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1 of the Purchase Price. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions that are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock), and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash may be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. 

Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law, Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our Bylaws 
 
 Some provisions of Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares. 
 
 These provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 
 
 Delaware Law 
 
 Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless 
 
 the transaction is approved by the Board before the date the interested stockholder attained that status 
 upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced or 
 on or after such time the business combination is approved by the Board and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 
 We have elected to not be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. 
 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our Bylaws 
 
 Among other things, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 provide for the division of the Board into three classes, each class consisting as nearly as possible of one-third of the whole. The term of office of one class of directors expires each year with each class of directors elected for a term of three years and until the stockholders elect their qualified successors, subject to the terms of the Nomination Agreement (as defined below) provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock or certain board designation rights, and subject to the terms of the Nomination Agreement, be filled by a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director 
 provide that our Bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 3 of our then outstanding voting stock 

provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or by a majority of the total number of directors which the Company would have if there were no vacancies 
 authorize the Board to adopt resolutions providing for the issuance of undesignated preferred stock. This ability makes it possible for the Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us 
 provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by the Board, subject to the terms of the Nomination Agreement 
 
 establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business (other than proposals submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in our proxy proposals) to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, for a proposal to be timely submitted for consideration at an annual meeting, notice must be delivered to our secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. Our Bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholders notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting provide that our Bylaws may be amended by the Board and 
 
 provide that that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. 
 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation regarding exclusive forum. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in our Certificate of Incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable. 
 
 The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
 Director Nomination Agreement 

In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy on April 22, 2016, we entered into the Director Nomination Agreement (the Nomination Agreement with Strategic Value Partners, LLC SVP and certain other consenting noteholders named therein (the Consenting Noteholders ). The Nomination Agreement is referenced in the Certificate of Incorporation as necessary to effectuate its terms. Pursuant to the Nomination Agreement 
 
 (a) following the expiration of the initial terms of the Board, the Board will consist of seven members as follows 
 
 (i) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, which shall be a Class III Director 
 
 (ii) two nominees designated by SVP (the SVP Designated Directors ), which shall be one Class I Director and one Class III Director provided, that (A) the number of nominees designated by SVP shall be reduced to one director, which shall be a Class III Director, at such time as SVP and its affiliates (other than other Consenting Noteholders) (the SVP Entities collectively beneficially own common stock representing an equity percentage of less than 15 and greater than or equal to 8 , with the understanding that such reduction to one director shall be permanent and despite any later increase in their equity percentage, and (B) SVP shall permanently, and despite any later increase in their equity percentage, no longer be entitled to designate a nominee at such time as the SVP Entities collectively beneficially own common stock representing an equity percentage of less than 8 
 
 (iii) two nominees designated by the Consenting Noteholders (excluding SVP until such time that SVP is no longer entitled to designate an SVP Designated Director), which shall be two Class II Directors provided, that (A) the number of nominees designated by the Consenting Noteholders shall be reduced to one director, which shall be a Class II Director, at such time as the Consenting Noteholders and their affiliates (the Noteholder Entities collectively beneficially own common stock representing an equity percentage of less than 15 and greater than or equal to 8 , with the understanding that such reduction to one director shall be permanent and despite any later 
 increase in their equity percentage, and (B) except as set forth in section (b)(iv) below, such Consenting Noteholders shall permanently, and despite any later increase in their equity percentage, no longer be entitled to designate a nominee at such time as the Noteholder Entities collectively beneficially own common stock representing an equity percentage of less than 8 
 
 (iv) for the purposes of calculating the equity percentage in clauses (A) and (B) of section (b)(iii), with respect to SVP s ownership, the equity percentage shall only include the portion of SVP s equity percentage that exceeds 15 up to a maximum of 7.9 , until such time that SVP is no longer entitled to designate an SVP Designated Director. At such time that SVP is no longer entitled to designate an SVP Designated Director, all of SVP s ownership shall be included in the equity percentage calculations in clauses (A) and (B) of section (b)(iii). For the purposes of section (b)(iii), the designation right contained in such provision shall still be available at the time SVP is no longer entitled to designate an SVP Designated Director, if at such time, the equity percentage ownership threshold in clause (B) of section (b)(iii) is satisfied and 
 
 (v) one independent director and one additional director (which will be the Non-Executive Chairman) nominated by the Nominating and Strategy Committee of the Board, which shall be a Class I Director and a Class III Director. 
 
 (b) for so long as such persons are entitled to designate a nominee for director under the terms thereof, SVP and the Consenting Noteholders have the right to remove the respective directors nominated by them pursuant to the Nomination Agreement, and to designate an individual to fill the vacancy created by such removal or upon any other removal of such person as director under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws on the date of such replacement designation. 
 
 The Nomination Agreement terminates upon the earlier to occur of (a) such time as the Consenting Noteholders in the aggregate no longer beneficially own common stock representing an equity percentage equal to or greater than 8 or (b) the delivery of written notice to the Company by all of the Consenting Noteholders, requesting the termination of the Nomination Agreement. Further, at such time as a particular Consenting Noteholder no longer beneficially owns any shares of common stock, all rights and obligations of such Consenting Noteholder under the Nomination Agreement will terminate. 
 
 As of March 2, 2023, the Consenting Noteholders own less than the requisite equity percentage necessary to maintain their right to nominate two Class II Directors under the Nomination Agreement and certain negative control rights provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation. As such, the related provisions of the Nomination Agreement and Certificate of Incorporation are no longer operative.

DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 This Director and Officer Indemnification Agreement, dated as of ______ ___, ____ (this Agreement ), is made by and between SilverBow Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and _______________________( Indemnitee ). 
 RECITALS 
 A. Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that the business and affairs of a corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors. 
 B. Pursuant to Sections 141 and 142 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, significant authority with respect to the management of the Company has been delegated to the officers of the Company. 
 C. By virtue of the managerial prerogatives vested in the directors and officers of a Delaware corporation, directors and officers act as fiduciaries of the corporation and its stockholders. 
 D. Thus, it is critically important to the Company and its stockholders that the Company be able to attract and retain the most capable persons reasonably available to serve as directors and officers of the Company. 
 E. In recognition of the need for corporations to be able to induce capable and responsible persons to accept positions in corporate management, Delaware law authorizes (and in some instances requires) corporations to indemnify their directors and officers, and further authorizes corporations to purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of their directors and officers. 
 F. The Delaware courts have recognized that indemnification by a corporation serves the dual policies of (1) allowing corporate officials to resist unjustified lawsuits, secure in the knowledge that, if vindicated, the corporation will bear the expense of litigation and (2) encouraging capable women and men to serve as corporate directors and officers, secure in the knowledge that the corporation will absorb the costs of defending their honesty and integrity. 
 G. Delaware law also authorizes a corporation to pay in advance of the final disposition of an action, suit or proceeding the expenses incurred by a director or officer in the defense thereof, and any such right to the advancement of expenses may be made separate and distinct from any right to indemnification and need not be subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct or otherwise affected by the merits of any claims against the director or officer. 
 H. The number of lawsuits challenging the judgment and actions of directors and officers of Delaware corporations, the costs of defending those lawsuits, and the threat to directors and officers personal assets have all materially increased over the past several years, chilling the willingness of capable women and men to undertake the responsibilities imposed on corporate directors and officers. 
 I. Recent federal legislation and rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the national securities exchanges have imposed additional disclosure and corporate governance obligations on directors and officers of public companies and have exposed such directors and officers to new and substantially broadened civil liabilities. 
 1 

J. These legislative and regulatory initiatives have also exposed directors and officers of public companies to a significantly greater risk of criminal proceedings, with attendant defense costs and potential criminal fines and penalties. 
 K. The authority of a corporation to indemnify and advance the costs of defense to its directors and officers applies to criminal proceedings as well as to civil, administrative and investigative proceedings. 
 L. Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company and his or her willingness to serve in such capacity is expressly conditioned upon the Company s willingness to indemnify him or her in accordance with the principles reflected above, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state of Delaware, and upon the other undertakings set forth in this Agreement. 
 M. Therefore, in recognition of the need to provide Indemnitee with substantial protection against personal liability, in order to procure Indemnitee s continued service as a director or officer of the Company and to enhance Indemnitee s ability to serve the Company in an effective manner, and in order to provide such protection pursuant to express contract rights (intended to be enforceable irrespective of, among other things, any amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (collectively, the Constituent Documents ), any change in the composition of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board or any change-in-control or business combination transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancement of Expenses (as defined in Section 1(e)) to Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement and for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company s directors and officers liability insurance policies. 
 N. In light of the considerations referred to in the preceding recitals, it is the Company s intention and desire that the provisions of this Agreement be construed liberally, subject to their express terms, to maximize the protections to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder.

Indemnitee s right to such advancement is not subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not conditioned upon any prior determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to the Indemnifiable Claim or the absence of any prior determination to the contrary.

In connection with any such payment, advancement or reimbursement, if delivery of an undertaking is a legally required condition precedent to such payment, advance or reimbursement or is otherwise requested by the Company (including, without limitation, pursuant to any provision of the Constituent Documents now or hereafter in effect relating to Indemnifiable Claims), Indemnitee shall execute and deliver to the Company an undertaking in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (subject to Indemnitee filling in the blanks therein and selecting from among the bracketed alternatives therein), which need not be secured and shall be accepted by the Company without reference to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses. In no event shall Indemnitee s right to the payment, advancement or reimbursement of Expenses pursuant to this Section 3 be conditioned upon any undertaking that is less favorable to Indemnitee than, or 
 5 

that is in addition to, the undertaking set forth in Exhibit A . Indemnitee s undertaking to repay any such amounts is not required to be secured. 
 4. Indemnification for Additional Expenses. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within five business days of such written request in accordance with Section 7 hereof, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably paid or incurred by Indemnitee or which Indemnitee determines are reasonably likely to be paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Claim made, instituted or conducted by Indemnitee, in each case to the fullest extent permitted or required by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time hereafter be amended to increase the scope of such permitted or required indemnification, reimbursement or advancement of such Expenses, for (a) indemnification or payment, advancement or reimbursement of Expenses by the Company under any provision of this Agreement, or under any other agreement or provision of the Constituent Documents now or hereafter in effect relating to Indemnifiable Claims, and or (b) recovery under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company provided , however , that Indemnitee shall return, without interest, any such advance of Expenses (or portion thereof) which remains unspent at the final disposition of the Claim to which the advance related. 
 5. Contribution . To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law in effect on the date hereof or as such law may from time to time hereafter be amended to increase the scope of permitted or required indemnification, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the payment of any and all Indemnifiable Claims or Indemnifiable Losses, in such proportion as is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and or transaction(s) giving cause to such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss and or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its other directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and or transaction(s) provided that such contribution shall not be required where it is determined, pursuant to a final disposition of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss in accordance with Section 8, that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification by the Company with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee from any claim of contribution that may be brought by directors, officers, employees or other agents or representatives of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee. 
 6. Partial Indemnity. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of any Indemnifiable Loss, but not for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. 
 7. Procedure for Notification . To obtain indemnification under this Agreement in respect of an Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor, including a brief description (based upon information then available to Indemnitee) of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss. If, at the time of the receipt of such request, the Company has directors and officers liability insurance in effect under which coverage for such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss is potentially available, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss to the applicable insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall provide to Indemnitee a copy of such notice delivered to the applicable insurers, and copies of all subsequent correspondence between the Company and such insurers regarding the Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, in each case 
 6 

substantially concurrently with the delivery or receipt thereof by the Company. If requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, at the Company s expense, to enforce on behalf of and for the benefit of Indemnitee all rights (including rights to receive payment) that may exist under the applicable policies of insurance in relation to such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss. The failure by Indemnitee to timely notify the Company of any Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, the Company did not otherwise learn of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss and such failure results in forfeiture by the Company of substantial defenses, rights or insurance coverage. 
 8. Determination of Right to Indemnification . 
 (a) To the extent that Indemnitee shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Indemnifiable Claim or any portion thereof or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against Indemnifiable Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim in accordance with Section 2 and no Standard of Conduct Determination (as defined in Section 8(b)) shall be required with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim. 
 (b) To the extent that the provisions of Section 8(a) are inapplicable to an Indemnifiable Claim that shall have been finally disposed of, any determination of whether Indemnitee has satisfied any applicable standard of conduct under Delaware law that is a legally required condition precedent to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against Indemnifiable Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim (a Standard of Conduct Determination shall be made as follows (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, (ii) if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by a majority vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of all Disinterested Directors, in each case even if less than a quorum of the Board, or (iii) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or if Indemnitee so requests, by Independent Counsel, selected by the Indemnitee and approved by the Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee provided , however , that if at the time of any Standard of Conduct Determination Indemnitee is neither a director nor an officer of the Company, such Standard of Conduct Determination may be made by or in the manner specified by the Board, any duly authorized committee of the Board or any duly authorized officer of the Company (unless Indemnitee requests that such Standard of Conduct Determination be made by Independent Counsel, in which case such Standard of Conduct Determination shall be made by Independent Counsel). Indemnitee will cooperate with the person or persons making such Standard of Conduct Determination, including providing to such person or persons, upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within five business days of such request, any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys and experts fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person or persons making such Standard of Conduct Determination. 
 (c) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause any Standard of Conduct Determination required under Section 8(b) to be made as promptly as practicable. If (i) the person or persons empowered or selected under Section 8 to make the Standard of Conduct Determination shall not have made a determination within 30 days after the later of (A) receipt by the Company of written notice in accordance with Section 7 hereof from Indemnitee advising the Company of the final disposition of the applicable Indemnifiable Claim (the date of such receipt being the Notification Date and (B) the selection of an Independent 
 7 

Counsel, if such determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, and (ii) Indemnitee shall have fulfilled his or her obligations set forth in the second sentence of Section 8(b), then Indemnitee shall be deemed to have satisfied the applicable standard of conduct, absent (a) actual fraud in the request for indemnification, (b) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (c) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law provided that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person or persons making such determination in good faith requires such additional time for obtaining or evaluating any documentation or information relating thereto. 
 (d) If (i) Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder against any Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 8(a), (ii) no determination of whether Indemnitee has satisfied any applicable standard of conduct under Delaware law is a legally required condition precedent to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against any Indemnifiable Losses, or (iii) Indemnitee has been determined or deemed pursuant to Section 8(b) or (c) to have satisfied any applicable standard of conduct under Delaware law which is a legally required condition precedent to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against any Indemnifiable Losses, then the Company shall pay to Indemnitee, within five business days after the later of (x) the Notification Date in respect of the Indemnifiable Claim or portion thereof to which such Indemnifiable Losses are related, out of which such Indemnifiable Losses arose or from which such Indemnifiable Losses resulted and (y) the earliest date on which the applicable criterion specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall have been satisfied, an amount equal to the amount of such Indemnifiable Losses. 
 9. Presumption of Entitlement. 
 (a) In making a determination of whether Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Indemnifiable Claim or any portion thereof or in defense of any issue or matter therein, the Company acknowledges that a resolution, disposition or outcome short of dismissal or final judgment, including outcomes that permit Indemnitee to avoid expense, delay, embarrassment, injury to reputation, distraction, disruption or uncertainty, may constitute such success. In the event that any Indemnifiable Claim or any portion thereof or issue or matter therein is resolved or disposed of in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including any resolution or disposition thereof by means of settlement with or without payment of money or other consideration), it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of such Indemnifiable Claim or portion thereof or issue or matter therein. The Company may overcome such presumption only by its adducing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 
 (b) In making any Standard of Conduct Determination, the person or persons making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable standard of conduct, and the Company may overcome such presumption only by its adducing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The knowledge and or action, or failure to act, of any director, officer, employee, agent or representative of the Company will not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of any Standard of Conduct Determination. Any Standard of Conduct Determination that Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable standard of conduct shall be final and binding in all respects, including with respect to any litigation or other action or proceeding initiated by Indemnitee to enforce his or her rights hereunder. Any Standard of Conduct Determination that is adverse to Indemnitee may be challenged by Indemnitee in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. No determination by the Company (including by its directors or any Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not satisfied any applicable standard of conduct shall be a defense to any Claim by Indemnitee for indemnification or reimbursement or advance 
 8 

payment of Expenses by the Company hereunder or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct. 
 (c) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 9(b), (i) to the extent that any Indemnifiable Claim relates to any entity or enterprise (other than the Company) referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of the definition of Indemnifiable Claim, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have satisfied the applicable standard of conduct if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the interests of such entity or enterprise (or the owners or beneficiaries thereof, including in the case of any employee benefit plan the participants and beneficiaries thereof) and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, and (ii) in all cases, any belief of Indemnitee that is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company, the Board, any committee of the Board or any director, or on information or records given or reports made to the Company, the Board, any committee of the Board or any director by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by or on behalf of the Company, the Board, any committee of the Board or any director shall be deemed to be reasonable. 
 10. No Adverse Presumption. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any applicable standard of conduct or that indemnification hereunder is otherwise not permitted. 
 11. Non-Exclusivity. The rights of Indemnitee hereunder will be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have against the Company under the Constituent Documents, or the substantive laws of the Company s jurisdiction of incorporation, any other contract or otherwise (collectively, Other Indemnity Provisions provided , however , that (a) to the extent that Indemnitee otherwise would have any greater right to indemnification under any Other Indemnity Provision, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right hereunder and (b) to the extent that any change is made to any Other Indemnity Provision which permits any greater right to indemnification than that provided under this Agreement as of the date hereof, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right hereunder. The Company will not adopt any amendment to any of the Constituent Documents the effect of which would be to deny, diminish or encumber Indemnitee s right to indemnification under this Agreement or any Other Indemnity Provision. 
 12. Liability Insurance and Funding. For the duration of Indemnitee s service as a director and or officer of the Company, and thereafter for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any pending or possible Indemnifiable Claim, the Company shall use reasonable efforts (taking into account the scope and amount of coverage available relative to the cost thereof) to cause to be maintained in effect directors and officers liability insurance providing coverage for directors and or officers of the Company that is at least substantially comparable in scope and amount to that provided by the Company s current policies of directors and officers liability insurance, which insurance may include any insurance provided directly or indirectly (including pursuant to any fronting or reinsurance arrangement) by or through a captive insurance company meeting the requirements set forth under Section 145(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. At Indemnitee s written request, the Company shall provide Indemnitee with a copy of all directors and officers liability insurance applications, binders, policies, declarations, endorsements and other related materials, and shall provide Indemnitee with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same. Without limiting the generality or effect of the two immediately preceding sentences, the Company shall not discontinue or significantly reduce 
 9 

the scope or amount of coverage from one policy period to the next (i) without the prior approval thereof by a majority vote of the Incumbent Directors, even if less than a quorum, or (ii) if at the time that any such discontinuation or significant reduction in the scope or amount of coverage is proposed there are no Incumbent Directors, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In all policies of directors and officers liability insurance obtained by the Company, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company s directors and officers most favorably insured by such policy. The Company may, but shall not be required to, create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means, including a letter of credit, to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy its obligations to indemnify and advance expenses pursuant to this Agreement. 
 13. Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the related rights of recovery of Indemnitee (excluding insurance obtained on the Indemnitee s own behalf) against other persons or entities (other than Indemnitee s successors), including any entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of the definition of Indemnifiable Claim in Section 1(g). Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required to evidence such rights (all of Indemnitee s reasonable Expenses, including attorneys fees and charges, related thereto to be reimbursed by or, at the option of Indemnitee, advanced by the Company). 
 14. No Duplication of Payments. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment to Indemnitee in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received and is entitled to retain payment (net of any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith and any repayment by Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under any insurance policy, the Constituent Documents and Other Indemnity Provisions or otherwise (including from any entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of the definition of Indemnifiable Claim in Section 1(g)) in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. 
 15. Defense of Claims. Except for any Indemnifiable Claim asserted by or in the right of the Company (as to which Indemnitee shall be entitled to exclusively control the defense), the Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim or, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee. The Company s participation in the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim of which the Company has not assumed the defense will not in any manner affect the rights of Indemnitee under this Agreement, including Indemnitee s right to control the defense of such Indemnifiable Claims. With respect to the period (if any) commencing at the time at which the Company notifies Indemnitee that the Company has assumed the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim and continuing for so long as the Company shall be using its reasonable best efforts to provide an effective defense of such Indemnifiable Claim, the Company shall have the right to control the defense of such Indemnifiable Claim and shall have no obligation under this Agreement in respect of any attorneys or experts fees or expenses or any other costs or expenses paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with defending such Indemnifiable Claim (other than such costs and expenses actually and reasonably paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any cooperation in the Company s defense of such Indemnifiable Claim or other action undertaken by Indemnitee at the request of the Company or with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) provided that if Indemnitee believes, after consultation with counsel selected by Indemnitee, that (a) the use of counsel chosen by the Company to represent Indemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict, (b) the named parties in any such Indemnifiable Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and Indemnitee and Indemnitee shall conclude that there may be one or more legal defenses available to him or her that are different from or in 
 10 

addition to those available to the Company, or (c) any such representation by such counsel would be precluded under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain and use the services of separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any particular Indemnifiable Claim) at the Company s expense. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit Indemnitee s right to retain or use his or her own counsel at his or her own expense in connection with any Indemnifiable Claim provided that in all events Indemnitee shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the defense by the Company of any Indemnifiable Claim that the Company shall have assumed and of which the Company shall be using its reasonable best efforts to provide an effective defense. The Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any threatened or pending Indemnifiable Claim effected without the Company s prior written consent. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any threatened or pending Indemnifiable Claim to which Indemnitee is, or could have been, a party unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such Indemnifiable Claim. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to any proposed settlement provided that Indemnitee may withhold consent to any settlement that does not provide a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee. 
 16. Successors and Binding Agreement. 
 (a) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee and his or her counsel, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including any person acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the Company for purposes of this Agreement), but shall not otherwise be assignable or delegatable by the Company. 
 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Indemnitee s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, legatees and other successors. 
 (c) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 16(a) and 16(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Indemnitee s right to receive payments hereunder shall not be assignable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest or otherwise, other than by a transfer by Indemnitee s will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 16(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned or transferred. 
 17. Notices. For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or one business day after having been sent for next-day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary 
 11 

of the Company) and to Indemnitee at the applicable address shown on the signature page hereto, or to such other address as any party hereto may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be effective only upon receipt. 
 18. Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware , without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of such State. The Company and Indemnitee each hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for all purposes in connection with any action or proceeding which arises out of or relates to this Agreement and agree that any action instituted under this Agreement shall be brought only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. 
 19. Validity. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal. In the event that any court or other adjudicative body shall decline to reform any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the parties thereto shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to replace the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal with one or more alternative provisions that effectuate the purpose and intent of the original provisions of this Agreement as fully as possible without being invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal. This Agreement shall replace and supersede the indemnification agreement in effect between Indemnitee and the Company immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Indemnitee and the Company (the Prior Indemnification Agreement provided that if, after giving effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 19 and any actions contemplated thereby that are taken pursuant thereto, Indemnitee is not satisfied, in his or her sole discretion, with the rights and benefits provided to Indemnitee by this Agreement, Indemnitee may elect to have the Prior Indemnification Agreement, rather than this Agreement, govern the rights and obligations of the parties hereto in relation to the subject matter of the Prior Indemnification Agreement with the same force and effect as if this Agreement had never replaced or superseded the Prior Indemnification Agreement (it being the intent of the parties hereto to fully preserve the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Prior Indemnification Agreement in that event). 
 20. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be waived, modified or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by Indemnitee and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto or compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party hereto that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company and any Indemnitee who is an officer of the Company. 
 21. Legal Fees and Expenses Interest. 
 (a) It is the intent of the Company that Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees and or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to Indemnitee 
 12 

hereunder. Accordingly, without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, if it should appear to Indemnitee that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3) or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes Indemnitee from time to time to retain counsel of Indemnitee s choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent Indemnitee in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense, including the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, and any such suit shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneys and related fees and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any of the foregoing to the fullest extent permitted or required by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time hereafter be amended to increase the scope of such permitted or required payment of such fees and expenses. 
 (b) Any amount due to Indemnitee under this Agreement that is not paid by the Company by the date on which it is due will accrue interest at the maximum legal rate under Delaware law from the date on which such amount is due to the date on which such amount is paid to Indemnitee. 
 22. Certain Interpretive Matters. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (a) it or its or words of any gender include each other gender, (b) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, (c) the terms hereof, herein, hereby and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (d) the terms Section or Exhibit refer to the specified Section or Exhibit of or to this Agreement, (e) the terms include, includes and including will be deemed to be followed by the words without limitation (whether or not so expressed), and (f) the word or is disjunctive but not exclusive. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number will refer to calendar days unless business days are specified and whenever action must be taken (including the giving of notice or the delivery of documents) under this Agreement during a certain period of time or by a particular date that ends or occurs on a non-business day, then such period or date will be extended until the immediately following business day. As used herein, business day means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a United States federal holiday. 
 23. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 Re Year-End 2022 
 S.E.C. Guideline Reserves 
 Independent Estimation 
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
 At your request, we have independently prepared an estimate of the oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid proved reserves and future net cash flows effective December 31, 2022, attributable to SilverBow Resources (SilverBow) net interests in certain oil and gas properties. The estimated reserves are located in the Continental United States. Based on information provided by SilverBow, the estimated reserves reported herein comprise all of the SilverBow proved reserves.. 
 
 This report, completed on January 23, 2023 has been prepared for SilverBow, and is provided for inclusion in relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration statements or other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. All proved reserves are estimated in compliance with the definitions contained in Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, Rule 210.4-10(a), and in our opinion, the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 
 
 The net reserves, future net cash flow, and discounted future net cash flow to the SilverBow interest in these properties, effective December 31, 2022, are estimated to be as follows 
 
 Proved Reserves Estimated Net Reserves Estimated Net Cash Flow Oil (Barrels) Gas (Mcf) Natural Gas Liquids (Barrels) Not Discounted Discounted at 10 Percent Per Year Proved Producing 22,211,700 687,820,700 19,391,200 4,886,402,000 2,515,206,800 Proved Nonproducing 1,148,300 7,660,900 131,700 113,332,000 68,872,200 Proved Undeveloped 28,829,200 1,030,070,600 13,133,200 5,671,874,000 2,386,033,000 Total Proved 52,189,200 1,725,552,200 32,656,100 10,671,608,000 4,970,112,000 
 
 The discounted future net cash flow summarized in the above table is computed using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum. Future net cash flow as presented herein is defined as the future cash inflow attributable to the evaluated interest less, if applicable, future operating costs, ad valorem taxes, and future capital expenditures. Future cash inflow is defined as gross cash inflow less, if applicable, royalties and severance taxes. Future cash inflow and future net cash flow stated in this report exclude 

consideration of state and federal income tax. Future costs of facility and well abandonments, and the restoration of producing properties to satisfy environmental standards are not deducted from cash flow. 
 
 This reserve report conforms to the term third party reports as stated in Regulation S-K, Item 1202. The assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used by H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. to conduct the independent reserve estimates are appropriate for the purposes of this report, and we have used all methods and procedures we consider necessary under the circumstances to prepare this report. The proved reserves estimates are in compliance with the applicable definitions contained in Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. 
 
 The processes, methods, and procedures employed by us to evaluate the necessary information, estimate reserves, support assumptions, and document methodologies are effective, and meet or exceed guideline standards. We used appropriate engineering, geologic, and evaluation principles that are consistent with practices routinely recognized in the petroleum industry. Reserve estimates are based on extrapolation of established performance trends, material balance calculations, volumetric calculations, analogy with the performance of comparable wells, or a combination of these methods. 
 
 The primary economic assumptions in the reserves estimating process include the application of product prices, operating costs, and future capital expenditures that are not escalated and therefore remain constant for the projected life of each property. Product benchmark prices are based on an average of 2022 first-day-of-the-month prices in accordance with Regulation S-X guidelines. A price differential is applied to the oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids benchmark prices to adjust for transportation, geographic property location, and quality or energy content. As a reference, the 12-month average benchmark price for oil is 94.13 per barrel, referenced to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price at Cushing Oklahoma, and for natural gas is 6.436 per million British thermal units, referenced to Henry Hub gas price. The average adjusted prices, for oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, used to determine reserves are 94.36 per barrel, 6.14 per thousand standard cubic feet and 34.76 per barrel, respectively, over the projected lives of the assets. 
 
 Lease operating costs are based on historical operating expense records. For all properties, general and administrative overhead expenses have been included. Estimates of capital costs are included as required for workovers and development. SilverBow has informed us that the development activities included herein have been subjected to and received internal approvals required by SilverBow management. 
 
 In conducting this work, we relied on data supplied by SilverBow. The extent and character of ownership, oil and natural gas sales prices, operating costs, future capital expenditures, historical production, accounting, geological, and engineering data were accepted as represented, and we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted. No independent well tests, property inspections, or audits of operating statements were conducted by our staff in conjunction with this work. We did not verify or determine the extent, character, status, or liability, if any, of production imbalances, hedging activities, or any current or possible future detrimental environmental site conditions. In our judgment, there are no instances where current local, state, or federal regulations will materially impact the ability of SilverBow to recover the estimated proved reserves. 
 
 In order to estimate the proved reserves and future cash flows attributable to SilverBow, we have relied on geological, engineering, and economic data furnished by our client. Although we instructed our client to provide all pertinent data, and we made a reasonable effort to analyze it carefully with methods applied in the petroleum industry, there is no guarantee that the volumes of hydrocarbons or the cash flows projected will be realized. 
 
 Hydrocarbon reserves estimates contain inherent uncertainties. The estimation of reserves is based on the application of a wide range of technologies and the subjective interpretation of currently available data therefore, the reserves discussed herein are considered estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Future economic or operating conditions may affect recovery of estimated reserves and cash flows, and reserves of all categories may be subject to change as more performance data become available or as alternative estimating methods become applicable. Estimates of future net cash flow and 
 H.J. GRUY AND ASSOCIATES, INC. 6575 West Loop South, Suite 550, Bellaire, Texas 77401 (713) 739-1000 

discounted future net cash flow should not be interpreted to represent the fair market value for the estimated reserves. 
 
 H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. is a privately owned, independent consultancy, and compensation for our efforts is not contingent upon the outcome of our work. H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. and its employees have no direct financial interest in SilverBow Resources, or the properties, nor do we contemplate any future direct financial interest.
