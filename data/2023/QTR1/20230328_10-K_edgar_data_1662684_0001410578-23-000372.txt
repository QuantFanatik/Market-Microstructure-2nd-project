 primary application has been aviation. However, advances in measurement and computing technologies have allowed KULR VIBE to provide transformative and scalable solutions across transportation, renewable energy (wind farm), manufacturing, industrial, performance racing and autonomous aerial (drone) applications among others. KULR VIBE addresses one of the most challenging issues with advanced machinery today; excessive energy robbing vibrations that are destructive to both the machinery and in many cases the operator. The KULR VIBE suite of technologies utilize proprietary sensor processes with advanced learning algorithms to both achieve precision balancing solutions, and successfully predict component failure based on its comprehensive database of vibration signatures. Its enhanced AI learning algorithms pinpoint areas where excess vibrations cause a loss of energy that can lead to system malfunctions, weakened performance, and maintenance issues. This innovative technology can be utilized as a standalone solution or be paired with existing track and balance technology to facilitate vibration reduction, achieve increased energy production, and reduce mechanical failures thereby extending platform life. KULR VIBE recently balanced the motors and blades of a mission critical drone to demonstrate the benefits of the technology. The results were a 23 increase in battery life and a lift increase of 45 . Same motors, same blades, KULR VIBE optimized. The KULR VIBE suite of products and services have provided vibration analysis and mitigation to global companies across multiple industries and sectors. According to Fact.MR, an insights-driven global market intelligence company, the global vibration motor market is estimated at 6.5 billion in 2022 and is forecast to reach 24.1 billion by 2032, growing at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 14.1 during 2022-2032. The Future is Energy + AI We believe the future of KULR is Energy + AI. We are building our AI infrastructure on industry leading Nvidia and AMD semiconductor platforms, and they are hosted on a hybrid of private cloud and Microsoft Azure. As the world faces shortages in supply of raw materials to produce enough Li-ion batteries to power everything from EV s to smartphones, KULR is developing a modular battery storage architecture that can be used across multiple applications with real-time monitoring by AI-powered CellCheck.

Securing this MoliCel battery cell supply accelerates our ability to provide total solutions to high value customer applications with revenue potential that could exceed 350 million annually in five years. Energy Storage Lithium-ion batteries are the dominant technology on the market for energy storage because of their cost and availability but do carry well documented safety risks. While rare, cell to cell thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries can cause a fire or explosion. For example, an explosion at Arizona Public Service s McMicken battery plant injured four emergency responders in 2019 and overheating caused the 1.2 GWh Moss Landing storage facility in California to go off-line. To reach net zero by mid-century will require an additional 245 GWh of battery capacity each year until 2030, but incidents of the like distill trust in battery technologies and threaten to slow the pace which is needed to achieve decarbonization goals. KULR s passive propagation resistant (PPR) and thermal runaway shield (TRS) technologies prevent cell to cell thermal runaway propagation and inhibit fire and ejecta of a single cell from exiting the battery enclosure, making battery energy storage packs safe for homes, hospitals, schools, and universities, and more. KULR is partnering with leaders in the energy storage industry such as Volta Energy Products, the subsidiary of Buffalo NY based parent company, Viridi Parente, to increase deployments of safe, reliable, and durable energy storage safety systems to accelerate the broader energy transition.

 Battery Recycling and Management KULR-Tech Safe Case provides a safe and cost-effective solution to commercially store and transport lithium batteries, which is increasing in frequency as supply chain challenges and ESG commitments necessitate battery recycling and end-of-lifecycle management. Whether shipping a single battery, a battery-powered device or a load shipment of batteries, KULR s technology mitigates the impacts of cell-to-cell thermal runaway propagation and ensures a safe journey. KULR s Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) technology is trusted by NASA to ship and store astronauts laptop batteries on the International Space Station. In addition, KULR combines its Passive Propagation Resistant (PPR) solutions with its new CellCheck intelligent battery management system to extend battery life. The CellCheck modular battery management system platform is KULR s AI-powered battery safety technology for e-mobility, energy storage and fleet applications. It captures real time and lifetime battery intelligence, sensing adverse electrical, environmental, and physical events to analyze and control for maximum battery safety, reliability, and performance. As commercial industries across the board face greater scrutiny to comply with ESG standards, KULR is serving a total addressable market for a circular economic model for batteries that will reach over 21 billion by 2025 (estimated based on market data projections published by Grand View Research, Inc. stating that the global battery recycling market size is expected to reach 21.04 billion by 2025). E-mobility KULR is supporting the shift to electrified transport by enabling safer, lighter, and faster charging lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and micro mobility solutions. KULR s passive propagation resistant (PPR) battery pack solutions increase battery energy capacity while preventing thermal runaway events that can lead to hazardous explosions, helping the transportation industry to address growing public safety concerns around electric vehicles, electric aviation and micro-mobility markets. Vehicle technology advancements and EV range anxiety requires more battery capacity to expand the range and power of existing platforms while adding new, power-demanding components for advances such as 5G data networks. The additional strain on batteries increases the risk for overheating and serious failures and can damage sensitive chip architecture. In addition, overheating has been a key limiting factor for advancing fast charging battery technology. KULR s carbon fiber thermal management technologies reduce the thermal resistance inside battery cells while increasing electrical conductivity to dissipate heat more efficiently to enable the safe deployment of fast charging batteries. With KULR, automotive OEMs and battery manufacturers can increase the energy capacity of battery cells so less cells are needed, making for lighter vehicles that drive further before needing to be charged. Aerospace/Defense KULR s thermal management solutions enable the defense and aerospace industries to safely deploy electronic technologies that support critical missions and protect national security. Technology in this sector is developing at increasing rates - the space industry alone will be worth nearly 3 trillion in 30 years. The electronic devices being placed into aircrafts, satellites, and missiles are becoming ever smaller and more powerful. Lithium-ion batteries, which are already prone to overheating and propagation, are exposed to harsh thermal environments as well as shock and vibration during aerospace and defense operations. The Company has partnered with Lockheed Martin, Leidos and other prime contractors to develop and supply mission-critical technologies for hypersonic vehicles, high-power magnetic wave, and other defense systems. High-Powered Computing 5G Demand for improved, cost-effective cooling solutions in the rapidly growing 5G and cloud computing industries is ever-increasing. KULR s portfolio of thermal management solutions target air and liquid-cooling of high-performance computing applications such as crypto mining, cloud computing, AI, and AR/VR simulations to maximize performance, energy efficiency and safety. KULR s proprietary carbon fiber-based suite of thermal interface materials leverage advanced carbon fiber based heatsink technology that offers customers highly customizable, lightweight, and cost-effective solutions with industrial-level reliability due to their high thermal conductivity, lightweight, and low contact pressure. New Battery Cell Development KULR started a research and development initiative using carbon fiber structures to produce battery cells with higher energy density and faster charging capabilities. Fast-charging will be the killer app for next-gen batteries. Right now, overheating is a key limiting factor in advancing fast-charging battery technology. There may be a way to solve that problem by using carbon fiber inside the battery cell to reduce thermal and electrical resistance which can dissipate heat more effectively. The R D initiatives include thicker cathode with higher loading factor, silicon anode, lithium metal anode and solid-state electrolyte development. This is a long-term strategic development for KULR.

The alliance will establish a thermal management testing and design platform for high-performance battery solutions with the highest safety ratings that will be adapted to the technical requirements of Andretti s racing enterprise with the goal of transferring solutions to mass-market electric vehicle (EV) applications. New Facility and IT-Systems KULR relocated in October 2021 to a new facility located at 4863 Shawline St, San Diego, CA. The facility is 3 times larger than the previous facility with adequate room to support our new automated battery cell testing capability that will launch in Q123 as well as personnel growth. Additionally, we installed independently enclosed areas to support the machine shop, testing lab, battery lab, and Fiber Thermal Interface Material FTI manufacturing lab. We have implemented a 5S standard for the entire facility and received ISO 9001 certification in July 2022. KULR opened a new facility in January 2023 at 1692 N. Texas Avenue, Webster, TX. This facility provides 4800 ft2 space in an industrial complex where KULR will focus on research and development related activities for lithium-ion battery systems. This space will provide room for additional personnel office space, an engineering design and prototyping sandbox, a 3D printing room, an electrical room for tab welding operations, and a small warehouse for storage. Once fully operational, activities will be completed to have the new location included in KULR s existing ISO 9001 certification. KULR TRS (Thermal Runaway Shield) Manufacturing: KULR will be onboarding a fully automated TRS manufacturing system in our Texas facility in early Q323. The intent of this system is to further onshore the manufacturing of TRS thereby reducing supply chain risks, costs, and improve LT performance for our customers. This is another example of KULR nearshoring/onshoring our manufacturing of products to gain further direct control of manufacturing. By developing automated systems, we are capable of being very competitive, and in certain cases, more competitive than offshore manufacturing we considering total cost of ownership. KULR has engaged with Managed Solutions to enhance our IT infrastructure and improve all aspects of Cybersecurity. As a sub-contractor for DOD programs, it is vital that KULR have state of the art IT systems and controls. We believe the best path based on the current scale of the company is to outsource this activity to a professional IT services organization. The result of this activity was an improvement of our NIST score of over 140 points. Additionally, KULR has further increased its Cybersecurity initiatives by hiring FRSecure to act as a VCISO and provide continuous cyber threat training to our personnel. They also will audit our current level of threat sophistication and ensure any weak link is addressed immediately. Corporate KULR was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015 and was formerly known as KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc. and, prior to that, as Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation. In April 2016, KULR implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, KULR Technology Corp, was formed in 2013 and is based in San Diego, California. Since its inception, KTC primarily focused on developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies, which it acquired through assignment from and license with KTC s co-founder Dr. Timothy Knowles. Prior to 2013, KTC s technologies were used in numerous advanced space and industrial applications for NASA, Boeing, and Raytheon. A few notable achievements were the use of KTC s technologies in the X-31 aircraft (battery heat sink), Mercury Messenger (battery heat sink), and X-51 Scramjet (heat exchanger). On June 19, 2017, KULR closed a share exchange with KTC and 100 of the shareholders of KTC (the KTC Shareholders whereby the KTC Shareholders agreed to transfer an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of KTC s common stock to KULR in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of KULR s common stock to the KTC Shareholders (the Share Exchange ), resulting in KTC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of KULR and KTC s business of developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies becoming KULR s main operation. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, with KTC being treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this Annual Report reflect the assets, liabilities and historical results of KTC prior to the completion of the Share Exchange.

 On August 30, 2018, KULR changed its name from KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc. to KULR Technology Group, Inc. by filing a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. On December 31, 2018, KULR filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000. As a result, the aggregate number of the Company s authorized capital stock became 520,000,000 shares. Recent Developments COVID-19 In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread across the globe, including the U.S., and other countries in which the Company or its affiliates operate, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp contraction in many areas of the global economy and increased volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets. In response to the pandemic, the governments of many countries, provinces, states, municipalities, and other geographic regions took preventative or protective actions, including closures of certain businesses, mandatory quarantines, limits on individuals time outside of their homes, travel restrictions and social distancing or other preventative measures. Such measures have been eased or lifted in varying degrees by different governments of various countries, states and municipalities since implementation in 2020, but the continued spread of COVID-19 and increased infection rates has caused, and may continue to cause, some jurisdictions to roll back reopening plans that had been underway and re-impose quarantines, border closures, closure of certain businesses and stay-at-home orders. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy and, specifically, the U.S., and the other countries in which the Company or its affiliates operate. We continue to closely monitor and respond, where possible, to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As the global situation continues to change rapidly, ensuring the health and safety of our employees remains one of our top priorities. In the U.S., numerous states have continued to remove their COVID-19 related restrictions. This has resulted in the re-opening of, and increased occupancy capacities in, retail outlets, including those that sell our products. Any reinstatement of restrictions on the operations of retail outlets could negatively impact our short-term results of operations in the U.S. Additionally, in the U.S., there have been a number of supply chain challenges, such as container ships facing delays due to congestion in ports, impacting many industries, including the industries in which we operate. For example, during the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022, we experienced significant impact to our business due to the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, China, during which time inventory in excess of 325,000 could not be shipped. The product was shipped, and revenue was recognized during the subsequent quarter. COVID-related challenges have resulted in delays in product shipment, not cancellations. As restrictions have eased in recent months, we expect to make up for lost time and revenue as we move through our sizeable inventory. We are currently taking active steps to direct our production and supply chain activities to North America to geographically diversify and potentially reduce further COVID-19 impacts. Although we have not yet seen a significant impact from supply chain disruptions, we continue to monitor our supply chain closely. Collectively, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected our results of operations and, if the effects continue unabated, could continue to do so as long as measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic remain in effect or supply chains continue to be challenged. At this time, neither the duration nor scope of the disruption can be predicted; therefore, the ultimate impact to our business cannot be reasonably estimated, but such impact could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our significant cash on hand and short-term investments will be adequate to meet liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Appointment of Officers and Management Appointment of Chief Technology Officer On November 1, 2022, the Company announced the appointment by the Company s Board of Directors (the Board of Dr. William Walker as Chief Technology Officer CTO of the Company.

 Appointment of Lead Director of the Board On November 1, 2022, the Board appointed Dr. Joanna Massey as lead director (the Lead Director of the Board. Dr. Massey has served on the Board, and its committees, since June 2021. The Board, believing that the Lead Director position would enhance corporate governance and relieve certain duties of the Board s Chairman, Michael Mo, to allow him to focus on the performance of his Chief Executive Officer duties, designated certain responsibilities to be fulfilled by the Lead Director, including but not limited to: (i) coordinating the activities of the independent directors; (ii) setting the agenda for board meetings in conjunction with the CEO and corporate secretary; (iii) chairing executive sessions of the independent directors; and (iv) performing such other duties as are assigned from time to time by the board. Management Equity Incentive Grants On November 1, 2022, the Board unanimously approved equity grants, to each of Dr. Joanna Massey and Morio Kurosaki, equal to 30,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be vested in four equal quarterly installments (the first vest occurred on December 31, 2022), and grants of a fully vested 7,500 shares for services performed during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. On November 1, 2022, the Board also unanimously approved the termination of a previously issued equity incentive grant of 1,500,000 shares to each of Keith Cochran and Michael Mo, which grants had vesting schedules corresponding with the achievement of certain market-capitalization milestones. In order to more accurately reflect the incentive compensation that the previously issued grants were intended to achieve, the Board approved replacement equity grants to each of Keith Cochran and Michael Mo in the form of Restricted Stock Units RSUs for the stock settlement of 1,500,000 shares, which RSUs contain provisions for delayed stock settlement and for vesting to occur in four equal annual installments. The foregoing is a summary description of certain terms of the RSUs. Sales and Marketing Strategy The Company employs various channels to market and sell its products and solutions, including direct sales to customers, as well as sales through representatives and strategic partners. We believe that establishing direct relationships with Key Accounts allows for deeper technical interactions, faster turnaround times, and provides valuable feedback that helps inform product development and marketing efforts. To ensure that our target customers fully understand the unique features and benefits of our products and services, we organize technology day events. We use a combination of marketing approaches to reach prospects and customers, such as leveraging employee, representative, and strategic partner relationships, maintaining an informative website, attending industry conferences, and conducting market research. Recently, we expanded our direct sales and marketing teams, and we are excited to welcome Mr. Ted Krupp, a highly experienced professional with important relationships in the Aerospace and Defense sectors, as our new VP of Sales and Marketing. Looking ahead, we plan to further expand our direct sales team to enhance our Key Account coverage and support a growing representative and distributor network. Advertising and Communications Strategy We employ a diverse range of advertising and communication tools to reach our audience. These include commissioning impartial white papers and technical papers, participating in industry events, conferences, and symposiums as attendees, sponsors, and guest speakers. We maintain a public relations consultant who oversees our press releases and media relations, ensuring that we maintain a positive presence in newspapers, magazines, and blogs. To bolster our social media outreach activities, we have a dedicated SEO specialist. We leverage our strong reputation within the thermal management and lithium-ion battery safety communities to spread positive feedback through word-of-mouth. Additionally, we utilize several social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, to reach a broader audience. Intellectual Property and Patent Strategy Our intellectual property strategy includes pursuing patent protection for new innovations in core carbon fiber architecture development, application development, acquisition of intellectual property, and licensing of third-party patents and intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we have twelve patents granted and assigned to KULR, an exclusive license to four third party patents, and ten pending nonprovisional and provisional patent applications.

 Product and Services In addition to KULR ONE and KULR VIBE, here are some of the technologies and products we offer to customers: Lithium-Ion Battery Thermal Runaway Shield TRS : KULR has developed a thermal insulation technology aimed at passive resistance to thermal runaway propagation in Li-ion batteries in partnership with National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center NASA JSC ). HYDRA TRS acts as a heat sink during normal Li-ion battery pack operation but also prevents thermal runaway propagation, which is a serious concern for aerospace and defense customers and electric vehicle manufacturers. The HYDRA is a vaporizing thermal capacitor that provides passive prevention of thermal runaway propagation TRP in Li-ion battery packs. Thermal runaway can occur spontaneously in a Li-ion cell due to a short. This can trigger an explosive release of electric energy that ruptures the end cap resulting in a flare and combustion of cell materials. Released heat drives the triggered cell temperatures to > 500 C, causing a dramatic increase in neighboring cell temperatures. Temperatures above the critical 130 C greatly increases the chance for a short in adjacent cells and result in TRP. TRS keeps neighboring cell temperatures from rising above 100 C (well below the 130 C threshold) and prevents TRP. KULR Automated Battery Cell Screening and Test System: KULR completed the installation of a fully automated battery cell testing platform this January in our Sand Diego facility. The system fully supports the stringent requirements of NASA and the DOD. This platform has been designed to meet the entire specifications of NASA WI-037 battery testing requirements. This fully automated system is believed to be the only fully automated system capable of such performance. We have designed the system to be modular and have installed a minimum of 500K cell capacity annually capable of handling 18650 and 21700 cells. Volume processing will start in February 2023. CellCheck: A scalable battery management platform to provide a new level of safety, performance optimization and regulatory compliance capabilities to our customers. We achieve this by putting together a modular architecture that is built on large data sets, performing an array of analytics, and then layering on top of it AI algorithms to provide predictive and preventative intelligence to our customers. It s modular so that we can incorporate new capabilities and enhancements to the platform as the battery evolution accelerates in the coming years. This is another significant step to position KULR as a one-stop-shop total solutions provider of battery thermal energy and safety management. KULR-Tech Safe Case: This product was developed for the commercial transportation and storage of Li-ion batteries. It is an extension of the product jointly developed with NASA, the TRS Bags which safely store and transport Li-ion batteries to and in the International Space Station. The cases have been tested and granted special permits by the Department of Transportation (DOT) for shipment of Li-ion batteries up to 2.1KWh for shipment of batteries classified as DDR (damaged, defective or recall), recycling and prototype. Fiber Thermal Interface Material FTI : KULR thermal interface materials TIMs consist of vertically oriented carbon fiber velvets attached to a film of polymer or metal. The fiber packing density and orientation are selected to serve a wide range of applications, including hostile thermal and chemical environments, sliding interfaces, and interfaces with widely varying gaps. They can be coated for electrical isolation. They require low contact pressure and provide high thermal conductivity. Their light weight and high compliance make them uniquely suited for aerospace, industrial and high-performance commercial devices. Phase Change Material PCM Heat Sink : KULR PCM composite heat sinks consisting of a conductive carbon fiber velvet embedded with a proprietary heat dissipation medium having high latent heat at its melting point. Such heat sinks offer passive thermal control for instruments that would otherwise overheat or under-cool during periodic operations. A typical application involves lasers that dissipate heat but need tight thermal control where active cooling is unavailable. Internal Short Circuit ISC Device : In March 2018, KULR reached an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL ), a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, to be the exclusive manufacturing and distribution partner for the patented ISC device, which causes predictable battery cell failures in Li-ion batteries, making them easier to study and, therefore, safer. Li-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power; billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. They provide power for everything from smart phones and laptops to electric cars and space crafts. But Li-ion batteries fail, sometimes with catastrophic results. Due to the relative rarity of cell failures, scientists and researchers had been unable to reliably or accurately replicate latent defect cell failures in lab settings, impeding research into safer battery technology. CRUX Cathode : The CRUX Cathode is composed of a carbon fiber velvet, providing a means of generating powerful electron pulses by field emission from the tops of the carbon fibers. CRUX Cathodes can be customized for different applications

 including the generation of microwaves, x-rays, and laser radiation. They can be fabricated in a wide variety of physical configurations, ranging from simple planar and cylindrical forms to more complex lobed shapes. Competition Currently, the battery industry uses a number of solutions to mitigate thermal runaway propagation that are offered by Aspen Aerogel, Unifrax, Lydall, LHS, 3M, Engineered Syntactic Systems, Celono, AllCell and others. Each of their solutions offer unique features and benefits for a specific application. We do not believe, however, that there is a one-size-fits-all solution across all applications. We believe our PPR design solution offers competitive light-weight and effective solutions for high energy battery cells because it is more flexible and can fit into different design configurations. For applications that require passive, light-weight solutions for high energy density battery cells, TRS offers a competitive solution. Thermal interface material is a large and fragmented market with many large suppliers including Henkel Bergquist, Fujipoly, Laird, 3M, Honeywell and others. These solutions are typically based on silicone and thermal particles. KULR s FTI offers high bulk thermal conductivity and low contact pressure requirements, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other thermal interface solutions. Our licensed ISC device offers a reliable way to trigger battery cell thermal runaway compared to nail penetration, over-charging or over-heating the cell. ISC does not rely on mechanically damaging the battery exterior to activate the short, as do most of the other evaluation methodologies. Instead, the ISC devices trigger true internal shorts. This makes it possible to accurately pinpoint and fix problems leading to malfunctions, an ability that we believe will give us a competitive advantage over other testing solutions. Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance Certain substances we use in our manufacturing process are subject to federal governmental regulations (such as Environmental Protect Agency regulations). We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, and that the cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws is not material. As a small generator of hazardous substances, we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances, such as acetone that is used in very small quantities to manufacture our products. We are currently in compliance with these regulations. Most new materials sold in the U.S or in many other countries require regulation by government authorities. In most other countries, there are no specific regulations that require additional regulation, but some countries do have registration requirements with which we comply to the best our ability. Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had 62 full time employees and 16 contractors. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes. In addition, KULR leverages outsource partners for IT management, Software Development, Battery Cell R D, and Machine Automation. Intellectual Property We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets. We have, and will continue to, file applications for and/or obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by implementing organizational nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. As of December 31, 2022, we held eight U.S. patents and six non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2035. In addition, KULR has exclusive license on four patents from its partnerships. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine KULR products; KULR has been granted trademarks for Class 9 and Class 17 applications.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the Company s common stock involves a high degree of risk. In determining whether to purchase the Company s common stock, an investor should carefully consider all of the material risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report before deciding to purchase the Company s securities. An investor should only purchase the Company s securities if he or she can afford to suffer the loss of his or her entire investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We are a young company with a limited operating history, making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment. KULR was formed in 2015 and KTC was formed in 2013. The Company, as a whole, has limited operating history. We have not yet demonstrated sales of products at a level capable of covering our fixed expenses. Since inception, we have not demonstrated the capability to produce sufficient materials to generate the ongoing revenues necessary to sustain our operations in the long-term. Nor have we demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient sales to sustain the business. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever produce a profit. Many of the Company s products represent new products that have not yet been fully tested in commercial product settings and for which manufacturing operations have not yet been fully scaled. This means that investors are subject to all the risks incident to the creation and development of multiple new products and their associated manufacturing processes, and each investor should be prepared to withstand a complete loss of their investment. Because we are subject to these uncertainties, there may be risks that management has failed to anticipate and you may have a difficult time evaluating our business and your investment in our Company. Our ability to become profitable depends primarily on our ability to successfully commercialize our products in the future. Even if we successfully develop and market our products, we may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to achieve or sustain profitability, which could cause us to cease operations. We have no sustainable base of products approved for commercial use by our customers, have never generated significant product revenues and may never achieve sufficient revenues for profitable operations, which could cause us to cease operations. KULR primarily sells bulk materials or products made with these materials to other companies for incorporation into their products. Although KULR s technologies were previously used in numerous advanced space and industrial applications for NASA, there has been no significant incorporation of our materials or products into customer products that are released for commercial sale as of the date of this report. Because there is no demonstrated history of large-scale commercial success for our products, it is possible that such commercial success may never happen and that we will never achieve the level of revenues necessary to sustain our business. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. We anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that our current cash balance plus capital available under the Company s Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA will be adequate to fund our operations over the next; however we may require additional funds for our anticipated operations and if we are not successful in securing additional financing, we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, product candidates or products. We could experience significant disruptions in supply from our current or future sources. We could experience significant disruptions as a result of global supply chain issues and, in the event of a disruption, we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or alternative purchasers of our products. Identifying suitable supplier and purchasers is a resource-intensive process that requires us to become satisfied with quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. In addition, any indirect supply chain disruptions due to United States trade policy with China or the recent military conflict in Ukraine may further complicate existing supply chain constraints and direct or indirect customers demand for our products. Interruption of our supplies and in demand of our products by our purchasers, or the loss of one or more key suppliers or purchasers, could have a negative effect on the Company s business and operating results. Any delays, interruption or increased costs or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and result in lower net sales and operating income both in the

 short and long term, which could in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition and the price of our shares. In addition, we cannot adequately predict the effects of the global supply chain disruptions on our customers or potential customers and the indirect effects such disruptions could have on our operations both in the short and long term, which could in turn negatively impact our business, financial condition and the price of our shares. We have limited experience in higher volume manufacturing that will be required to support profitable operations, and the risks associated with scaling to larger production quantities may be substantial. We have limited experience manufacturing our products. We have established small-scale commercial or pilot-scale production facilities for our carbon-based thermal management products, but these facilities do not have the existing production capacity to produce sufficient quantities of materials for us to reach sustainable sales levels. At present, we rely on outsourced partners to produce high volume products. In order to develop internal capacity to produce much higher volumes, it will be necessary to produce multiples of existing processes or engineer new production processes in some cases. We have begun building up the scale of our automated battery cell facilities in our new leased facility in San Diego but there is no guarantee that we will be able to economically scale-up our production processes to the levels required. If we are unable to scale-up our production processes and facilities to support sustainable sales levels, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease operations. We have a long and complex sales cycle and have not demonstrated the ability to operate successfully in this environment. It has been our experience since our inception that the average sales cycle for our products can range from one to five years from the time a customer begins testing our products until the time that they could be successfully used in a commercial product. We have only demonstrated a limited track record of success in completing customer development projects, which makes it difficult for you to evaluate the likelihood of our future success. The sales and development cycle for our products is subject to customer budgetary constraints, internal acceptance procedures, competitive product assessments, scientific and development resource allocations, and other factors beyond our control. If we are not able to successfully accommodate these factors to enable customer development success, we will be unable to achieve sufficient sales to reach profitability. In this case, the Company may not be able to raise additional funds and may be forced to curtail or cease operations and you could lose all or a significant part of your investment. We are dependent on customers and partners to design and test our solution into new applications which may not be brought to market successfully. The Company targets its thermal management solution for new applications and devices that require high performance and unique features offered by its products. Developing new applications and devices involves a lengthy and complex process, and they may not be commercialized on a timely basis, or at all. The Company s success is directly related to the success of these new products. Furthermore, because the Company s solutions are relatively new to mass market consumer electronics, the design and testing time is longer than traditional solutions. Moreover, in transitioning to new technologies and products, we may not achieve design wins, our customers may delay transition to these new technologies, our competitors may transition more quickly than we do, or we may experience product delays, cost overruns or performance issues that could harm our operating results and financial condition. We could be adversely affected by our exposure to customer concentration risk. We are subject to customer concentration risk as a result of our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. During 2022, we had 3 customers whose purchases accounted for 87 of total revenues. Due to the nature of our business and the relatively large size of many of the applications our customers are developing, we anticipate that we will be dependent on a relatively small number of customers for the majority of our revenues for the next several years. It is possible that only one or two customers could place orders sufficient to utilize most or all of our existing manufacturing capacity. In this case, there would be at risk of significant loss of future revenues if one or more of these customers were to stop ordering our materials, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and on your investment. We operate in an advanced technology arena where hypothesized properties and benefits of our products may not be achieved in practice, or in which technological change may alter the attractiveness of our products. Because there is no sustained history of successful use of our products in commercial applications, there is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications may be technically feasible. Some of the scientific and engineering data related to our products has been generated in our own laboratories or in laboratory environments at our customers or third-parties. It is well known that laboratory data is not always representative of commercial applications.

 Likewise, we operate in a market that is subject to rapid technological change. Part of our business strategy is to monitor such change and take steps to remain technologically current, but there is no assurance that such strategy will be successful. If the Company is not able to adapt to new advances in materials sciences, or if unforeseen technologies or materials emerge that are not compatible with our products and services or that could replace our products and services, our revenues and business prospects would likely be adversely affected. Such an occurrence may have severe consequences, including the potential for our investors to lose all of their investment. Competitors that are larger and better funded may cause the Company to be unsuccessful in selling its products. The Company operates in a market that is expected to have significant competition in the future. Global research is being conducted by substantially larger companies who have greater financial, personnel, technical, and marketing resources. There can be no assurance that the Company s strategy of offering better thermal management solutions based on the Company s proprietary carbon fiber-based products will be able to compete with other companies, many of whom will have significantly greater resources, on a continuing basis. In the event that we cannot compete successfully, the Company may be forced to cease operations. Because of our small size and limited operating history, we are dependent on key employees. The Company s operations and development are dependent upon the experience and knowledge of Michael Mo, our Chief Executive Officer, Simon Westbrook our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. William Walker, our Chief Technology Officer, Keith Cochran, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Carpenter, our Vice President of Engineering. If the services of any of these individuals should become unavailable, the Company s business operations might be adversely affected. If several of these individuals became unavailable at the same time, the ability of the Company to continue normal business operations might be adversely affected to the extent that revenue or profits could be diminished, and you could lose all or a significant amount of your investment. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and our inability to enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade-secret laws of the United States and to protect our intellectual property rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed, reduce our market share or otherwise harm our business. In the event of unauthorized use of our intellectual property, litigation to protect or enforce our rights could be costly, and we may not prevail. Many of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, and our issued and pending U.S. patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage and could be challenged by third parties. Our inability to secure issuance of our pending patent applications may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights these pending patent applications were intended to cover. Our competitors may attempt to design around our patents to avoid liability for infringement and, if successful, our competitors could adversely affect our market share. Furthermore, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition. Our pending trademark applications may not be approved by the responsible governmental authorities and, even if these trademark applications are granted, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these trademark applications. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries could limit our ability to protect our products and their associated trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. We also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached, and may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise. Adequate remedies may not be available if there is an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. In addition, others may obtain knowledge about our trade secrets through independent development or by legal means. The failure to protect our processes, apparatus, technology, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business by jeopardizing critical intellectual property. Where a product formulation or process is kept as a trade secret, third parties may independently develop or invent and patent products or processes identical to our trade-secret products or processes. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to make and sell products or use such processes and could potentially result in costly litigation in which we might not prevail.

 We could face intellectual property infringement claims that could result in significant legal costs and damages and impede our ability to produce key products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our technologies conflict with the proprietary rights of others, we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings and we could face substantial monetary damages and be precluded from commercializing our products, which would materially harm our business and financial condition. Patents in the thermal management solutions industry are numerous and may, at times, conflict with one another. As a result, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover the multitude of product types. Ultimately, the courts must determine the scope of coverage afforded by a patent and the courts do not always arrive at uniform conclusions. A patent owner may claim that we are making, using, selling or offering for sale an invention covered by the owner s patents and may go to court to stop us from engaging in such activities. Such litigation is not uncommon in our industry. Patent lawsuits can be expensive and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing a third party s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents, including the commercialization of our products. In addition, there is a risk that we would have to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party s patents (which damages may be increased, as well as attorneys fees ordered paid, if infringement is found to be willful), or that we will be required to obtain a license from the other party in order to continue to commercialize the affected products, or to design our products in a manner that does not infringe a valid patent. We may not prevail in any legal action, and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, requiring cessation of activities that were found to infringe a valid patent. We also may not be able to develop a non-infringing product design on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not obtain U.S. Government contracts to further develop our technology. We can give no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining government contracts. The process of applying for government contracts is lengthy, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying with all requirements throughout such application process. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be awarded any U.S. Government contracts utilizing our carbon fiber-based solutions. Downturns in general economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability. Downturns in general economic conditions can cause fluctuations in demand for our products, product prices, volumes and gross margins. Future economic conditions may not be favorable to our industry. A decline in the demand for our products or a shift to lower-margin products due to deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect sales of our products and our profitability and could also result in impairments of certain of our assets. Furthermore, any uncertainty in economic conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect our business by reducing the prices that our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products or by reducing the demand for our products. An increase in the cost of raw materials or electricity might affect our profits. Any increase in the prices of our raw materials or energy might affect the overall cost of our products. If we are not able to raise our prices to pass on increased costs to our customers, we would be unable to maintain our existing profit margins. Our major cost components include items such as production materials and electricity, which items are normally readily available industrial commodities. During our history as a business, we have not seen any material impact (as defined by GAAP) on our cost structure from fluctuations in raw material or energy costs, but this could change in the future. Our results of operations could deteriorate if our manufacturing operations were substantially disrupted for an extended period. Our manufacturing operations may be subject to disruption due to extreme weather conditions, floods and similar events, major industrial accidents, strikes and lockouts, adoption of new laws or regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in governmental enforcement policies, civil disruption, riots, terrorist attacks, war, and other events. We cannot assure you that no such events will occur. If such an event occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on us.

 We may become subject to liabilities related to risks inherent in working with hazardous materials. Our development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as acetone. We are subject to federal, provincial and local laws and EPA regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. We are not specifically insured with respect to this liability. Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations and currently do not expect to make material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near-term, if we fail to comply with these regulations substantial fines could be imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production, alter manufacturing processes or cease operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future, or that our operations, business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations. Significant disruptions of information technology systems, breaches of data security and other incidents could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We maintain information in digital and other forms that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the privacy, security, confidentiality, and integrity of such confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of any future collaborators and our contractors, consultants, vendors and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage or unauthorized access or use resulting from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, hacking, phishing schemes intended to cause an unauthorized transfer of funds and other social engineering attacks, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. In December 2021, we were the subject of a phishing scheme involving a fraudulent email and wire instructions, resulting in the loss of approximately 138,000 in corporate funds. We took immediate action to contain and eradicate the security breach, including the implementation of control enhancements to prevent a similar situation from occurring again. We believe this was an isolated event and do not believe our technology systems have been compromised. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches such as the one that occurred in December 2021, there can be no assurance (i) that we will ever recover the funds lost, or (ii) that we will not suffer additional losses in the future. Additionally, while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, negative publicity and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. Any security compromise affecting us, our partners or our industry, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and lead to regulatory scrutiny, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The failure of financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our current and projected business operation and our financial condition and results of operations. During March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB ), Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC was appointed as receiver. A statement by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated that all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts. The standard deposit insurance amount is up to 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Although we do not have any funds deposited with the aforementioned banks that failed , we regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. A failure of a depository institution to return deposits could impact access to our invested cash or cash equivalents and could adversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.

 Future adverse regulations could affect the viability of the business. As a small generator of hazardous substances, we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances, such as acetone that is used in very small quantities to manufacture our products. We are currently in compliance with these regulations. However, there can be no assurance that future regulations might not change or raise the compliance standards, of which the Company may become in violate or for which we may incur substantial costs to comply. In most cases, as far as we are aware, there are no current regulations elsewhere in the world that prevent or prohibit the sale of the Company s products. However, there is no assurance that any regulations will not be enacted in the future to require the Company s products or production materials to be subject to test for toxicity or other health effects before they can be sold or used in the production process, if such regulations are enacted in the future, the Company s business could be adversely affected because of the requirement for expensive and time-consuming tests or other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that future regulations might not severely limit or even prevent the sale of the Company s products in major markets, in which case the Company s financial prospects might be severely limited, causing investors to lose some or all of their investment. Our directors and officers may be exposed to liability . We currently maintain a policy for director and officer liability insurance, also known as D O Insurance. However, the maximum coverage under our D O Insurance policy may not be sufficient to cover all such liability exposure and, as a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and will divert time and attention away from revenue generating activities. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Our management identified weaknesses in our internal controls, as described in Item 9A here within. Our internal control over financial reporting may still or could in the future have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which and continued existence of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and if we fail to comply in a timely manner, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or how costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In addition, although attestation requirements by our independent registered public accounting firm are not presently applicable to us, we could become subject to these requirements in the future and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any resulting changes to internal controls over financial

 reporting. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and share value may be negatively affected. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your common stock without adversely affecting the price, or at all depending on volume offered for sale at any time. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American LLC Exchange NYSE American ). We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell the common stock at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies using our common stock as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business. We are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American s listing requirements; if an issuer s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a low selling price (generally trading below 0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. If the NYSE American delists our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our common stock would qualify to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the Pink Sheets (a quotation medium operated by Pink Sheets LLC). If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity for our securities; a determination that our common stock are a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited. Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

 Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market. From time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to amended Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), and current public information and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise capital, we have and may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for a significant amount of our common stock. These issuances would dilute the percentage ownership interest, which would have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our shareholders vote and might dilute the book value of our common stock. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, to purchase shares of our common stock. Our common stock could be further diluted as a result of the issuance of convertible securities, warrants or options. In the past, we have issued convertible securities (such as convertible debentures and notes), warrants and options in order to raise money or as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors. We have shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of these convertible securities, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, could reduce the market price of our common stock or could result in adjustments to exercise prices of outstanding warrants (resulting in these securities becoming exercisable for, as the case may be, a greater number of shares of our common stock), or could obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our stockholders. The outbreak of Coronavirus has led to restrictions on travel and public meetings and has disrupted markets and shipping schedules. The COVID-19 virus pandemic has created global restrictions on travel and meetings, temporary and permanent closures of businesses and business activities, unemployment, loss of customers and suppliers, and reluctance of business management to make critical commitments and, instead, conserve cash. For example, we have experienced delays in customer acceptance of delivered products and shipment delays from our suppliers or customers suppliers, which delays have disrupted ours and our customers product development and testing processes. At this stage, the outlook has improved as federal, state and local economies have reopened and returned to pre-pandemic levels, there is no assurance the future impact of COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects during 2023 and beyond. Global economic uncertainty and financial market volatility caused by political instability, changes in international trade relationships and conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could make it more difficult for us to access financing and could adversely affect our business and operations. Our ability to raise capital is subject to the risk of adverse changes in the market value of our stock. Periods of macroeconomic weakness or recession and heightened market volatility caused by adverse geopolitical developments could increase these risks, potentially resulting in adverse impacts on our ability to raise further capital on favorable terms. The impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the US and China or an escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the US and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, also could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global trade patterns, which may in turn impact our ability to source necessary reagents, raw materials and other inputs for our research and development operations. We do not intend to pay dividends. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors,

 and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Voting power of our shareholders is highly concentrated by insiders. Our officers, directors and affiliates currently beneficially own approximately 34.2 of our outstanding Common Stock eligible to vote. Such concentrated control of the Company may adversely affect the value of our Common Stock. If you acquire our Common Stock, you may have no effective voice in our management. Sales by our insiders or affiliates, along with any other market transactions, could affect the value of our Common Stock. Our articles of incorporation allow for our board to create a new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors have the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of our preferred stock terms of which may be determined by the Board without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our Common Stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.

 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The Company did not repurchase any of its equity securities during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. ITEM 6. [Reserved] Not applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of KULR Technology Group, Inc. KULR and its wholly-owned subsidiary, KULR Technology Corporation KTC (collectively referred to as KULR or the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. References in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to us , we , our and similar terms refer to the Company. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties and other factors. These statements are often identified by the use of words such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, could, estimate, or continue, and similar expressions or variations. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report, and other factors that we may not know. Overview KULR Technology Group, Inc., through our wholly-owned subsidiary KULR Technology Corporation, develops and commercializes high-performance thermal management technologies for batteries, electronics, and other components across an array of battery-powered applications. For aerospace and Department of Defense DOD applications, our solutions target high performance applications in direct energy, hypersonic vehicles and satellite communications. For commercial applications, our main focus is a total solution to battery safety and sustainability by which we aim to mitigate the effects of thermal runaway propagation which has been known to cause random fires in lithium-ion Li-ion batteries. This total battery safety solution can be used for electric vehicles, energy storage, battery recycling transportation, cloud computing and 5G communication devices. Our proprietary core technology is a carbon fiber material that provides what we believe to be superior thermal conductivity and heat dissipation for an ultra-lightweight and pliable material. By leveraging our proprietary cooling solutions that have been developed through longstanding partnerships with advanced technology users like NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab and others, our products and services make commercial battery powered products safer and electronics systems cooler and lighter. KULR s business model continues to evolve from being a component supplier, to providing more design and testing services to our customers. The next step of evolution is to provide total system solutions to address market needs. In order to scale up as a systems provider more quickly and efficiently in (i) the Li-ion battery energy storage and recycling markets, (ii) battery cell design and safety testing, and (iii) advanced thermal management systems, such as hypersonic vehicles, KULR will actively seek partners for joint venture, technology licensing and other strategic partnership models. The goal is to leverage the Company s thermal design technology expertise to create market leading products, which KULR will take to market directly to capture more value for KULR shareholders. We have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations, as a result, we will eventually need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability. Until that time, we shall have to continue to raise cash, as and when required, through equity or debt financings. Recent Developments COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a novel strain coronavirus, a pandemic. During 2020 and continuing into 2023, the global economy has been, and continues to be, affected by COVID-19. While the Company continues to see signs of economic recovery as certain governments begin to gradually ease restrictions, provide economic stimulus and accelerate vaccine distribution, the rate of recovery on a global basis has been affected by resurgence of the virus or its variants in certain jurisdictions. The Company continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its business and operational assumptions and estimates and has determined there were no material adverse impacts on the Company s results of operations and financial position at December 31, 2022.

 The full extent of the future impact of COVID-19 on the Company s operations and financial condition is uncertain. Accordingly, COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects during 2023 and beyond, including the demand for its products, interruptions to supply chains, ability to maintain regular research and development and manufacturing schedules as well as the capability to meet customer demands in a timely manner. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. War in Ukraine The short and long-term worldwide implications of Russia s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions on Russia by the United States or other countries and possible counter sanctions by Russia, and the resulting economic impacts on oil prices and other materials and goods, could affect the price of materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If the price of materials used in the manufacturing of our product candidates increase, that would adversely affect our business and the results of our operations. New Officer Hires On November 1, 2022, Dr. William Walker was appointed as the new Chief Technology Officer. Appointment of Lead Director On November 1, 2022, our existing independent director, Dr. Joanna Massey, was designated Lead Director of our Board. Exercise of Warrants During March 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 70,143 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants pursuant to which the Company received an aggregate of 87,679 of gross proceeds. During April 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,346,525 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants pursuant to which the Company received an aggregate of 2,933,156 of gross proceeds. Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2021 Revenue Our revenues consisted of the following types: 

For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Product sales 2,643,325 1,495,328 Contract services 1,351,309 917,540 Total revenue 3,994,634 2,412,868 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated 3,994,634 and 2,412,868 of revenues from 36 and 20 customers, respectively, representing an increase of 1,581,766, or 66 . Revenue from product sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 1,147,997 or 77 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Product sales during these periods include sales of our component product, carbon fiber velvet CFV thermal management solution, internal short circuit ISC battery cells and devices, patented TRS technology, thermal fiber thermal interface FTI materials and heatsink technology. The increase in revenue from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to two contracts for custom TRS kits and heatsink technology which generated approximately 1,270,000 and 322,000 respectively, partially offset by a decrease attributable to contracts which generated approximately 485,000 for battery cells for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue from contract services during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 433,769 or 47 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to three large contracts which generated approximately 1,272,000, partially offset by a decrease attributable to contracts which generated approximately 862,600

 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our service revenues, which include certain research and development contracts and onsite engineering services, have not been hampered by restrictions arising from working under COVID-19 shelter-in-place regulations. Our customers and prospective customers are large organizations with multiple levels of management, controls/procedures, and contract evaluation/authorization. Furthermore, our solutions are new and do not necessarily fit into pre-existing patterns of purchase commitments. Accordingly, the business activity cycle between expression of initial customer interest to shipping, acceptance and billing can be lengthy, unpredictable, and lumpy, which can influence the timing, consistency and reporting of sales growth. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consisted of the cost of our products as well as labor expenses directly related to product sales or research contract services. Generally, we earn greater margins on revenue from products as compared to revenue from services, so product mix plays an important part in our reported average margins for any period. Also, we are introducing new products at an early stage in our development cycle and the margins earned can vary significantly between periods, customers and products due to the learning process, customer negotiating strengths, and product mix. The Company expects that margins will normalize as it prepares for the anticipated volume production of its product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cost of revenues was 1,630,527 and 1,102,038, respectively, representing an increase of 528,489, or 48 . The increase was primarily due to increased costs as a result of increased revenues. The gross margin percentage was 59 and 54 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Research and Development Research and development R D includes expenses incurred in connection with the R D of our CFV thermal management solution, high-areal-capacity battery electrodes, 3D engineering for a rechargeable battery and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, R D expenses were 3,977,563 and 1,662,183, respectively, representing an increase of 2,315,380 or 139 . The increase is primarily comprised of 1,337,351 related to planned increases in headcount in order to build future capacity, and 978,029 related to new R D initiatives designed to build future revenue growth. We expect that our R D expenses will increase as we expand our future operations. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation, marketing and advertising, salaries, payroll taxes and other benefits, accounting and tax, consulting fees, travel and entertainment, rent expense, office expenses, and legal and professional fees. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses were 16,672,526 and 11,162,062, respectively, an increase of 5,510,464 or 49 . This increase is primarily due to an increase in employee related costs to build future capacity for planned revenue growth of 2,484,407, marketing and advertising expenses of 1,500,371, travel expenses primarily related to customer and vendor relations of 484,214, NetSuite implementation costs of 390,000, and 315,773 of SEC filing fees and professional services. Other (Expense) Income For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other expenses, net, were 1,150,497 and 397,736, respectively, representing an increase of 752,761 or 189 . The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in interest expense recorded in connection with notes payable and the Prepaid Advance of 932,538, an increase in the related amortization of debt discount of 383,627, and the loss on debt extinguishment of 8,508, partially offset by a 272,856 increase in the change in fair value of accrued issuable equity, 158,675 gain on forgiveness of PPP loan and interest, and a decrease of debt redemption costs of 140,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash balances of 10,333,563 and 14,863,301, respectively, and working capital of 6,055,477 and 13,302,935, respectively.

 On May 13, 2022, we issued a 5,000,000 Promissory Note to Yorkville for gross proceeds of 4,750,000. On the same date, we entered into a SEPA which gives us the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to 50,000,000 of shares of our common stock to Yorkville during the 24 months following the effective date of the SEPA. Further, on September 23, 2022, we entered into the Supplemental SEPA, which allows us to request advances, (each, a Prepaid Advance ), still up to an aggregate of 50,000,000, from Yorkville. Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental SEPA, Yorkville has the right to receive shares, and may select the timing and delivery of such shares (via an Investor Notice ), in an amount up to the balance of the Prepaid Advance in order to pay down the Prepaid Advance.

Our cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to our net loss of 11,911,151, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of 4,670,955, as well as 434,522 of net cash generated from changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash used in investing activities was 4,647,974 and 2,737,235, respectively. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was related to deposits paid for equipment of 1,421,432, purchases of property and equipment of 2,682,970, and the purchase of intangible assets for 543,572. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to deposits paid for equipment of 2,153,950, purchases of property and equipment of 383,285, and the purchase of an intangible asset for 200,000. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash provided by financing activities was 17,472,361 and 15,526,070, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to net proceeds from the Prepaid Advance of 10,573,068, proceeds from a promissory note of 4,750,000, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 3,020,836, proceeds from the SEPA of 250,000, proceeds from the exercise of options of 53,457. These amounts were partially offset by repayments of the promissory note of 1,000,000, and payments of issuance costs related to the prepaid advance liability of 85,000, financing costs related to the SEPA for 72,800 and payments of issuance costs in connection with notes payable for 17,200. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from proceeds from the exercise of warrants in the amount of 11,719,204, proceeds from the sale of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants of 6,500,000, and proceeds from the exercise of options of 121,866.

As of December 31, 2022, future cash requirements for our current liabilities include 3,550,294 for accounts payable and accrued expenses and 223,645 for future payments under operating leases.

In addition, the Company committed to pay nonrefundable license fees and a minimum royalty of 67,500. Future cash commitments for long term liabilities consists of 97,958 for the long-term lease and a minimum royalty payment of 27,500. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had 9,000,000 of principal outstanding for a prepaid advance liability pursuant to the Supplemental SEPA. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company issued 2,839,217 shares of common stock in settlement of 3,000,000 of the Prepaid Advance. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the principal balance due on the Prepaid Advance is 6,000,000. While the Company expects that the prepaid advance liability will be repaid with the issuance of common stock, any prepaid advance balances outstanding for more than twelve months must be repaid in cash. The Company intends to meet its cash requirements from its current cash balance, proceeds from the SEPA or the Supplemental SEPA, and from future revenues. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash generated from equity and debt offerings. Under ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The above conditions are indicators that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 a going concern could exist as we have a history of recurring net losses, recurring use of cash in operations and declining working capital. Despite these conditions, we have a successful track record of raising capital as needed and continue to have a positive, ongoing relationship with a financial institution that has provided access to capital and will continue to support us. While no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising additional capital from Yorkville, as they are not obligated to advance funds so long as there is an outstanding Prepaid Advance, Yorkville has represented that in most scenarios, with mutual consent, they will continue to provide financial support as evidenced by the funds provided during March 2023. On March 10, 2023, the Company and Yorkville closed on a second Prepaid Advance in the amount of 2,000,000. Upon satisfaction of the Prepaid Advance liability, the Company will utilize its ability to draw down on the remaining 33,000,000 available under the SEPA. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and access to future capital to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date the financial statements have been issued and that our above plans alleviate any potential substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of March 24, 2023, our cash balance was approximately 7.3 million. Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial conditions, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures must be in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which these reported amounts rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. Significant estimates used in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, assumptions used in projecting future cash flows and liquidity, fair value calculations for intangible assets, equity securities, stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial results will be affected. Certain estimates could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to the Company as well as general economic conditions. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our financial statements included at the end of this Annual Report. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenues following the five-step model in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. The timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. A receivable is recorded when revenue is recognized prior to payment, and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, we record deferred revenue when payment is received from customers for which the Company had not yet satisfied its performance obligation under the contract, or the customers have not officially accepted the goods or services provided under the contract.

 Asset Acquisition In determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business and is instead deemed to be an asset. An asset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalizing transaction costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. Stock-Based Compensation We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value amount of the shares expected to ultimately vest is then recognized over the period for which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. The estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report for a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Index to Consolidated Financial Statements which appears on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) (the Exchange Act ). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level because of the material weakness discussed below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not design or maintain effective controls to ensure that there is an appropriate review and approval of electronic payments (wires, EFT s, ACH s and credit card payments). We are in the process of implementing a detailed plan for remediation of the material weakness, including developing and maintaining preventative controls around the electronic payment process to ensure proper segregation of duties. As of December 31, 2022, we have upgraded our enterprise software from QuickBooks to NetSuite which provides more documented authorizations and workflow and have implemented a control whereby approval is obtained for credit card payments prior to the purchase being made. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we have upgraded our banking platform such that all electronic payments will require dual approval in order for funds to be transferred.

 We will continue to devote time and attention to these remedial efforts, and we believe the above actions will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above during the first half of 2023. However, as we continue to evaluate and take corrective actions to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, we may take additional actions to address control deficiencies or modify certain of the remediation measures described above. Our remediation efforts will not be considered complete until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 as a result of the material weakness described above. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over current or future financial reporting. Inherent Limitations of the Effectiveness of Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm This Annual Report does not contain an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm related to internal control over financial reporting because the rules for smaller reporting companies provide an exemption from the attestation requirement. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. ITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS None.

 Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings Our directors, executive officers and control persons have not been involved in any of the following events during the past five years: any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to file reports of initial ownership of common stock and other equity securities and subsequent changes in that ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners have complied with all applicable filing requirements of Section 16(a), except that a Form 4 for Timothy Ray Knowles was filed late, resulting in the late disclosure of one transaction in his spouse s shares over which Mr. Knowles does not have direct voting or dispositive control. Nomination Process As of December 31, 2022, we did not affect any material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to the Board of Directors. We do not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the current stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our operations develop to a more advanced level. We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and there is no specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors assesses all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment. A stockholder who wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive Officer at the address appearing on the face page of this annual report.

Pre-Approval Policies Our Audit Committee, has adopted a policy governing the pre-approval by the Board of Directors of all services, audit and non-audit, to be provided to our Company by our independent auditors. Under the policy, the Audit Committee has pre-approved the provision by our independent auditors of specific audit, audit related, tax and other non-audit services as being consistent with auditor independence. Requests or applications to provide services that require the specific pre-approval of the board of directors must be submitted to the Audit Committee by the independent auditors, and the independent auditors must advise the Audit Committee as to whether, in the independent auditor s view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC s rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee has considered the nature and amount of the fees billed by Marcum and believes that the provision of the services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining the independence of Marcum.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of KULR Technology Group, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KULR Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficiency) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audits matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Description of Matter No. 1 As disclosed in Note 3 to the December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements, on October 5, 2022 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase all of the assets, including intellectual property, of Vibetech International, LLC Vibetech for consideration of 3,500,000, of which, 2,000,000 will be paid in cash, and 1,500,000 is to be paid in common stock. The Company also entered into an employment agreement with the owner of Vibetech for which significant amounts of the consideration paid are contingent and subject to claw back provisions tied to such employment. We identified the Company s accounting for the acquisition to be a critical audit matter as such accounting can be complex and require judgement on the part of management. 
 F-2 

Table of Contents 
 How We Addressed Matter No. 1 in Our Audit Our audit procedures to address this critical audit matter included the following: (i) we examined the contractual purchase agreements between the Company and Vibetech, (ii) we evaluated the various assets acquired to ensure management s accounting analysis was complete, (iii) we evaluated the terms and conditions of the employment agreement between the Company and the former owner of Vibetech, including the contingent consideration arrangement in which the payments are automatically forfeited if employment terminates, and (iv) we evaluated the Company s conclusions that a single asset (the intellectual property) constituted the majority of the purchase price and should not be accounted for as a business combination. We also engaged the assistance of our firm s internal valuation specialists in our overall testing procedures. Description of Matter No. 2 As disclosed in Note 2 to the December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate its liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern for a period within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As disclosed, the Company concluded that matters existed that could indicate substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern was probable as a result of its current working capital levels, history of operating and net losses, and cash used in operating and investing activities in 2022. The Company also disclosed its plans to alleviate the indicators that substantial doubt exists. We identified the Company s evaluation of its liquidity and financial conditions to be a critical audit matter as such evaluation required significant estimates and judgment on the part of management. How We Addressed Matter No. 2 in Our Audit Our audit procedures to address this critical audit matter included the following: (i) we evaluated the Company s future cash flow projections, which included examining future sources of revenue, comparing future cash outflows to historical amounts, and performing independent analytical procedures over the Company s future cash flow projections, (ii) we reviewed and evaluated the Company s plans for dealing with adverse conditions and events if liquidity was to become constrained in the future, (iii) we evaluated relevant transactions that transpired subsequent to December 31, 2022 that had an impact on the liquidity analysis, including recent capital raises and conversions of the prepaid advance liability, and (iv) we evaluated the Company s contractual arrangement with the financial institution identified in Note 2, which included independently communicating with such financial institution regarding the arrangement and their ability and intent to continue to support the Company. /s/ Marcum LLP Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

EXHIBIT 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK The following summarizes the material terms of the capital stock of KULR Technology Group, Inc. KULR, our Company, we or us ). KULR is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and accordingly its internal corporate affairs are governed by Delaware law and by its certificate of incorporation, as amended (our certificate of incorporation and its by-laws, which are filed as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov . The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which are subject to future amendment in accordance with the provisions thereof. Our common stock is the only class of our securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Authorized Capital Stock Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share. The number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of a recent date is set forth on the cover page of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of the same date, we had preferred stock designated as follows: 1,000,000 shares designated as Series A Preferred Stock (of which none were outstanding); 31,000 shares designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (of which none were outstanding); 400 shares designated as Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (of which none were outstanding); and 650 shares designated as Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (of which none were outstanding). Common Stock Voting Rights. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Dividends. Subject to the preferential rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of our preferred stock, holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of any of our funds legally available when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (our Board ). The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends depend upon our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt service obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. Liquidation. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our affairs, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share proportionately in our assets available for distribution to stockholders, subject to the preferential liquidation rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of our preferred stock. Other Rights. The holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights and no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities, and our common stock is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions. Preferred Stock Under our certificate of incorporation and subject to the limitations prescribed by law, our Board, without stockholder approval, may issue our preferred stock in one or more series, and may establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in such series and may fix the designation, powers, privileges, preferences and relative participating, optional or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. 

 When and if we issue additional shares of preferred stock, we will establish the applicable preemptive rights, dividend rights, voting rights, conversion privileges, redemption rights, sinking fund rights, rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up and any other relative rights, preferences and limitations for the particular preferred stock series. Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law, Our Certificate of incorporation and By-laws Delaware statutory law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make acquisition of our Company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise more difficult. These provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and takeover bids that our Board may consider inadequate and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. The description of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws set forth below is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which have been filed as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Blank Check Preferred Stock. Our certificate of incorporation permits us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of such series. The ability to issue such preferred stock could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. Number of Directors; Filling Vacancies; Removal. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that the Board will consist of not less than one member, with the exact number of directors to be fixed exclusively by the Board. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that a board vacancy resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a director or other cause, as well as a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office even though that may be less than a quorum of the Board. Special Meetings. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by our Board, certain officers of our Company or two-thirds or more in amount, of each class or series of the capital stock of our Company entitled to vote at such meeting on the matters that are the subject of the proposed meeting. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take an action opposed by our Board. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law . Section 203 of the DGCL provides that, subject to certain specified exceptions, a corporation will not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless (1) before that time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (2) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding certain shares) or (3) on or after such time, both the board of directors of the corporation and at least 66 2 / 3 percent of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder approves the business combination. Section 203 of the DGCL generally defines an interested stockholder to include (x) any person that owns 15 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately prior to the relevant date and (y) the affiliates and associates of any such person. 

 Section 203 of the DGCL generally defines a business combination to include (1) mergers and sales or other dispositions of 10 percent or more of the corporation s assets with or to an interested stockholder, (2) certain transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to the interested stockholder of any stock of the corporation or its subsidiaries, (3) certain transactions which would increase the proportionate share of the stock of the corporation or its subsidiaries owned by the interested stockholder and (4) receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit (except proportionately as a stockholder) of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial benefits. Under certain circumstances, Section 203 of the DGCL makes it more difficult for a person who would be an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period, although the certificate of incorporation or stockholder-adopted by-laws may exclude a corporation from the restrictions imposed under Section 203. Neither our certificate of incorporation nor our by-laws exclude our Company from the restrictions imposed under Section 203 of the DGCL. We anticipate that Section 203 may encourage companies interested in acquiring our Company to negotiate in advance with our Board since the statute s supermajority stockholder approval requirement would not be applicable if our Board approves, prior to the time the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, either the business combination or the transaction which results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is VStock Transfer LLC. Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American LLC Exchange under the symbol KULR.
