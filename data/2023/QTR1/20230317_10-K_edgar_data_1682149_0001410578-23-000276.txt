 PART I Item 1. Business Overview We believe that the future of audio technology is in wireless devices and that WiSA is well positioned to deliver best-in-class immersive wireless sound technology for intelligent devices and next generation home entertainment systems. We currently sell modules which wirelessly transmit and receive audio directly to speakers. Additionally, we plan to license our proprietary software technology, currently embedded in our wireless modules, to other companies who can then embed our technology into other Wi-Fi enabled smart devices. The segment of the wireless audio market that WiSA focuses on is comprised of scalable multichannel solutions with levels of latency that are low enough to synchronize with video. The term multichannel refers to the use of multiple audio tracks to reconstruct a sound field using multiple speakers. As part of the effort to grow the wireless multichannel home audio segment, WiSA Technologies, Inc (f/k/a Summit Wireless) was a founding member of the WiSA Association, an association dedicated to providing industry leadership and consumer choice through interoperability testing between brands. Products certified and marked with a WiSA Association logo have been tested to interoperate. This preserves consumer choice by enabling consumers to choose different wireless transmitting products across different brands where audio is decoded with speakers that have the WiSA Association logo displayed. Our marketing strategy focuses on, what we believe, are two emerging wireless audio market needs: immersive, multi-channel audio and lower signal latency. WiSA currently sells custom semiconductor chips and wireless modules to a growing list of consumer electronics customers, including major brands in the consumer electronics industry. We believe that a growing adoption of our technology by leaders in this industry will revolutionize the way people experience media content through their mobile devices, televisions TVs ), game consoles and personal computers PCs ). Our Business Focus Our primary business focus is to enable mainstream consumers and audio enthusiasts to experience high quality wireless immersive audio. We intend to continue selling our proprietary wireless modules to consumer electronics companies while also expanding our focus to implement a lower-cost solution by porting our software onto commercially available internet of things IoT modules with integrated Wi-Fi technology. Industry Background The primary growth segments for in-home entertainment have been Bluetooth stereo accessories which include single speakers, headsets, and more recently, multi-room stereo speakers that use your home s Wi-Fi network to stream audio throughout house. Another market that continues to grow is the sound bar market. Sound bars are typically sold with wireless subwoofers and may also be sold with wireless rear speakers. Our Technology Our fundamental technology addresses some of the main issues that we perceive hinder the growth of immersive audio in the home: complexity of installation and setup, cost, interoperability between smart devices and the speakers or soundbars. We believe that consumers want to experience theater-quality immersive sound from the comfort of their homes. However, traditional immersive audio systems, commonly referred to as home theater surround sound systems, are wired and often require expensive audio-visual AV receivers to decode the audio stream, leaving the consumer with the burden of concealing the wires. Hiring a professional to hide the wires into the walls or floor is invasive, complicated, costly, and time consuming. Further, people who rent as opposed to own their home, may not be able to install these systems as the installation construction needed may not be permitted under a lease agreement. Our first-generation wireless technology addresses these problems by transmitting wireless audio to each speaker at Blu-ray quality (uncompressed 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rates) and emphasizing ease of setup. To our knowledge, WiSA s custom chips and modules technology is one of the only technologies available today that can stream up to eight (8) separate wireless audio channels with low latency, removing lip-sync issues between the audio and video sources. In addition, every speaker within a system that utilizes our technology can be synchronized to less than one microsecond, thus eliminating phase distortion between speakers. WiSA s first-generation technology shows that wireless immersive audio systems are viable home audio solutions for the average consumer and audio enthusiast alike.

 Having successfully developed wireless audio solutions for the high-end of the immersive audio market, WiSA is continuing its development of proprietary software targeted at bringing its best-of-class immersive audio technology to entry/mid-level audio systems. Noting the growth of the sound bar market, WiSA plans a low-cost, entry-level wireless audio solution designed to meet the needs of the consumer looking for a sound bar-based, value-driven immersive audio system. To address this market segment, WiSA is currently developing certain proprietary software for which patent applications have been submitted that will enable sound bars as well as smart devices that have Wi-Fi and video media to deliver immersive audio. A prototype version of our software technology has been demonstrated to select customers (pursuant to confidentiality agreements). Our goal is to commercialize a software based-solution, which other brands can integrate into their devices, that will (i) reduce integration costs for mass market use, (ii) utilize Wi-Fi for wireless connectivity, making it easy to integrate into today s high volume, low cost systems on a chip SOC and modules, (iii) provide a low power consumption option to allow for use in battery-powered devices, and (iv) provide compatibility with popular consumer electronic operating systems. WiSA Association Our wholly-owned subsidiary, WiSA, LLC, operates the WiSA Association, which is an association of brands, manufacturers, and influencers within the consumer electronics industry, with the purpose of promoting a standardized method of interoperability between wireless audio components using WiSA s technology. The WiSA Association creates, maintains and manages specifications for wireless interoperability that are available to all WiSA Association members. For products with a WiSA Association certification, the WiSA Association also creates, maintains, and manages testing criteria and specifications for all products to be listed, marketed and sold. WiSA-certification is an industry-wide stamp of approval certifying that a product is interoperable with other products in the WiSA ecosystem and has passed several high-performance tests ensuring interoperability and wireless performance standards are met. As the sole owner of WiSA, LLC, we certify all WiSA Association products. In 2018, we introduced the WiSA Ready certification. The WiSA Ready certification identifies entertainment sources such as TVs, gaming systems or computers that are equipped to deliver up to eight (8) channels of HD audio to WiSA-certified speakers when connected with a WiSA Universal Serial Bus USB transmitter. This program simplifies consumer setup and reduces costs by replacing AV receivers or wireless hubs with a low-cost USB accessory. We believe that using WiSA Ready products allows consumers to more simply and conveniently enjoy wireless multi-channel sound, eliminating the clutter, wires, and complicated installs generally required to create immersive audio experiences. LG Electronics and Hisense have introduced TV and projector product lines that have been certified WiSA Ready . Additionally, TCL, Skyworth, and Bang Olufsen have built WiSA s modules into some of their TVs. Currently, WiSA-certified products are required to use WiSA modules in order to meet the standards set by the WiSA Association. As a result, WiSA Association members purchase modules from us in order to build their products to meet such standards. Among WiSA-certified products, consumers will be able to outfit their home entertainment system with WiSA-certified speakers and components from any participating vendor with the assurance that the devices will interoperate and provide high quality wireless HD surround sound. The WiSA Association manages logo usage and trademark guidelines, investigates alternative markets, connects brands to manufacturing resources, and, we believe, provides industry leadership in solving the challenges facing the home theater and commercial markets in the integration of wireless audio technology. As part of building the category of immersive audio and driving consumer awareness, WiSA has created the WiSA Wave, which includes a number of online direct-to-consumer marketing programs. WiSA Association has dramatically increased consumer awareness, as measured by web traffic through WiSA s websites. There were approximately 1.4 million web visitors in 2022. WiSA utilizes Google analytics to identify and measure unique user web traffic. WiSA Wave activities have expanded to include joint marketing WiSA products with retailers, the creation of WiSA storefronts on retailer websites, retailer co-op ads, and multibrand ads supporting WiSA members. Additionally, WiSA uses the WiSA Wave to drive the promotion and sale of the Platin Audio line of immersive audio speaker systems, a brand of speakers designed to promote WiSA Certified functionality at new price points and product performance levels.

 Modules WiSA has designed wireless modules that provide high performance wireless audio for our customers to integrate into their products, such as a speaker, TV, media hubs and USB or HDMI dongles. These modules include our custom semiconductors with our intellectual property IP built in as well as a Wi-Fi radio for communications. By designing and selling these modules, we believe that we can reduce our customers design expense, accelerate their time-to-market cycle, and reduce the cost of each module. WiSA offers both a TX module to transmit the audio from a host device like a media hub, TV or dongle to WiSA-enabled speakers and an RX model for speakers that receive the wireless audio signal and processes it for audio play out. Modules for Consumer Products WiSA s TX modules are targeted for integration into TVs, AV receivers, media hubs and USB or HDMI dongles. WiSA s transmitter, with its integrated antenna, is designed to support rooms as large as 10 meters by 10 meters with uncompressed, 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rate. The module supports a simple interface, with Inter-IC Sound I2S or USB audio and control. In addition, WiSA s technology has been approved by Digital Content Protection, LLC, the licensing agency for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection, as an audio-only output technology for retransmission of audio content. WiSA s receiver interfaces to a digital amplifier and is designed to be integrated directly into a home theater speaker. The four (4) printed circuit board (PCB) antennas simplify system integration while providing robust reception of 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rates virtually anywhere within a 10 meter by 10 meter space. It supports one or two separate audio outputs via I2S. An optional interface on the receiver module can be enabled to configure the speaker type and provide volume/mute control at the speaker. Alternatively, the speaker type can be assigned at the factory for preconfigured Home Theater in a Box applications. The WiSA Opportunity We believe that the following attributes: cost, mobility, video support, ease of installation and quality create a market opportunity for WiSA s technologies to be adopted by the consumer electronics industry as described further below. Cost We believe that the simplicity and cost structure of our current WiSA SoundSend transmitter and upcoming embedded software solution will make our prices competitive for a wider range of applications, allowing consumer electronics companies to integrate our technology, while also delivering high quality audio. Video Support Wireless audio capable of supporting video has become a priority for consumers across a variety of high-volume multimedia platforms, including TV s, smartphones, game consoles and set-top boxes. Video applications require audio and video to be perfectly synchronized in order to avoid lip-sync and speaker audio phase distortion issues. WiSA s technology prioritizes low latency and synchronization to less than one microsecond, thus practically eliminating phase distortion between speakers. Ease of Installation We believe that the home entertainment market has moved toward simplicity in recent years. The costly and inconvenient home theaters of the past have left consumers with a desire for audio systems that provide a simplified installation process. We believe that new audio systems, including the predominant sound bar system, are unable to provide high levels of performance, especially in the surround-sound market. WiSA s technology greatly simplifies the installation process of true surround-sound systems. This allows consumers to install a home theater system with the same amount of effort as a sound bar, but enjoy a far superior experience. We believe that an overwhelming majority of the content entering consumers homes through digital TV and streaming services is provided in a multi-channel format, which is why WiSA s goal is to facilitate enjoyment of true surround sound for both the everyday consumer and audio enthusiast.

 In addition to easy installation, WiSA modules provide consumers with a multitude of options, allowing customization of a home theater specific to each consumer, without being forced to stick with one brand of speaker. For example, our hope is that a consumer might start with a WiSA enabled sound bar for their TV and then add a WiSA enabled subwoofer. That same system can be easily upgraded to a variety of surround sound systems by simply adding more speakers. Our technology will allow consumers to upgrade an audio system or just one component of the system without the need to replace the entire system. Consumers can keep the original transmitter, sound bar, and subwoofer and integrate them seamlessly into a new system. Being able to outfit a home entertainment system with WiSA-enabled speakers and components gives consumers the ability to express their individual preference and needs and provides the assurance that the devices will interoperate, delivering what we believe is the highest standard in HD wireless surround sound. Dissatisfaction with Bluetooth Performance and Quality We believe that consumers want better performance and quality from their Bluetooth audio devices. For example, they may want headsets that stay connected over longer distances or products that offer better audio fidelity. By offering a solution that addresses these needs at a comparable price point to Bluetooth, we believe that we can build consumer demand for our technology. Profitability of Audio Component Accessories High-definition televisions HDTVs are getting thinner and it is becoming increasingly difficult to incorporate the latest electronic advances into such thin displays. Over two hundred million smart TVs are currently sold annually. We expect that eventually most of the electronics will be external to the display. We believe that the first physical feature to be removed from HDTVs will be the audio component, since there is very little room for quality speakers in today s thin displays. We believe that HDTV manufacturers know that they need to provide an audio alternative. Additionally, since cost is a significant consideration, we believe that some manufacturers may offer external sound bars which will satisfy some consumers, but perhaps not the consumers who desire a high-quality audio alternative. We believe that these developments are creating an inflection point in the market, and manufacturers are looking to WiSA s technology to create a standard for wireless audio interoperability that will support a long-term product strategy for the successful development of high quality, wireless audio products. By designing speaker systems that incorporate WiSA s technology, consumer electronics companies will be able to sell easy-to-install surround sound audio solutions alongside TVs. Enjoyment of improved audio on existing content We believe that the growth in the number of video devices streaming multi-channel audio content, coupled with new 3D immersive sound experiences from Dolby s Atmos and DTS DTS:X formats, will help propel the demand for wireless speakers well into the future. Enjoyment of wireless audio without interference from other wireless signals Having other devices nearby that also use the 5 GHz band should not affect the performance of a WiSA-enabled audio system, as WiSA s technology can seamlessly switch to another frequency within the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz U-NII spectrum utilized by WiSA technology has up to 24 channels available that are constantly monitored for interference using the Dynamic Frequency Selection sub-band between 5.2 and 5.8 GHz. When interference is detected, the next channel, having been monitored for over one minute and confirmed for accessibility, is ready to be accessed and WiSA-enabled devices switch seamlessly to that channel, without the user ever noticing or the audio experience being affected. What Distinguishes WiSA from its Competitors Both the proprietary technology and the adoption of the technology by leaders in consumer electronics are differentiating factors for WiSA. Our management believes that WiSA is one of the only companies with the technical capabilities of transmitting high resolution, low latency, and speaker synchronization of wireless audio capable of supporting up to eight channels. Premium consumer brands, like Bang Olufsen, Harman International, a division of Samsung, and LG Electronics have begun to adopt our technology as a valued feature in performance products.

 Category Defining Wireless Audio Our first generation wireless audio technology delivers industry leading eight channels of uncompressed audio directly to the speakers in 24 bit and up to 96 kHz sample rates. This means that a consumer can experience audio exactly as it was mastered in the studio. WiSA s technology supports surround sound systems up to 7.1 or 5.1.2 for Dolby Atmos configurations. Alternative technologies such as, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards were not designed to transmit fixed low latency audio that is synchronized to video. However, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards can work well for audio-only wireless transmission, when video is not a part of the listening experience. In audio-only applications, latency is less critical and audio data can be buffered in memory to ensure proper speaker synchronization even when data retransmissions are needed in today s congested wireless environments. In video applications, retransmissions add to latency. Standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards have long variable latency that can exceed acceptable audio to video synchronization and make quality multichannel audio experience unachievable. A few custom silicon-based solutions exist today that improve on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards based performance, but compared to WiSA, such products have longer latencies, lower performing speaker synchronization, and are limited to 2-4 audio channels and often only support 16 bit CD quality audio. WiSA s technology roadmap includes proprietary software that will enable standard Wi-Fi protocol to support multi-channel audio for video applications, while permitting WiSA to leverage Wi-Fi s lower chip and module cost structure. WiSA s first generation technology was designed for the mid to high end home theater market and offers a unique feature set that is expected to be included in new product designs for years. WiSA s new Wi-Fi strategy enables the Company to compete in the entry-level home theater market at Bluetooth price points, while delivering superior multi-channel performance for higher volume applications. The Company s recently announced Discovery module is the first product that integrates WiSA s new software which enables a transceiver module to keep up to four independent wireless audio channels synchronized in a room size up to 10 meters square. The Discovery modules is ideally suited for entry level home entertainment systems, including sound bars, TVs, subwoofers and Dolby Atmos applications. WiSA Customers WiSA currently sells wireless modules containing custom semiconductor chips to a growing list of consumer electronics customers, including major brands such as Bang Olufsen, KEF, LG, Harman International, a division of Samsung, Savant, Skyworth and System Audio. We believe that the use of our products by well-known consumer electronics brands will provide an opportunity to create wireless audio products that are simple to install and perform at high levels. Brands such as Bang Olufsen and Harman have chosen WiSA technology to drive their wireless home audio/theater product assortments. We believe that their leadership has brought credibility to the technology and paved the way at retail for other brands to follow. Our Strategy Our goal is to establish and maintain a leadership position as the ubiquitous standard for hi-fidelity wireless, multichannel audio. To obtain and enhance our position as the leading standard in the audio space, we intend to: improve recognition of our WiSA Certification brand and the WiSA standard brand; provide excellent products and services to our customers and members; make sure our technology is accessible to many consumers by having our technology in consumer electronics devices that sell at a variety of price points; expand market awareness of wireless multi-channel hi-fidelity audio experience availability; reduce hardware costs; enhance and protect our IP portfolio; invest in highly qualified personnel; and 
 build innovative products alongside the world s leading consumer electronics companies.

 We currently sell our modules in relatively small quantities. As new customers introduce WiSA-enabled products and current customers introduce second and third-generation WiSA-enabled products, we expect that orders for our modules will increase proportionally. With larger orders, we believe that we can take advantage of economies of scale and improve gross margins on our modules. Interoperability Interoperability is a key aspect of wireless technology. We believe that this is especially true with audio technology, where unique designs, price points, audio quality and capabilities as well as consumer brand loyalties are significant factors for the end consumer. Creating home theater and audio components that all work with an interoperable standard creates a high level of confidence in retailers and consumers in the functionality of the entire entertainment system. Interoperability also increases the opportunity for specialized brands to create new and innovative products knowing they can focus on their specific part of the market and rely on others to create the necessary cohort components. Proprietary Software A significant amount of our time and resources are being allocated towards launching a software licensing part of our business. Customers will receive a license for our TX software, so that any of their devices with a suitable Wi-Fi radio can transmit audio compliant with our standard without having to purchase and integrate our TX module. We believe that this software will be well positioned for use by major consumer electronics companies in many devices including TVs, handsets, gaming consoles, and computers. Patent applications have been submitted for key technology innovations in this software. Research and Development As of March 14, 2023, our research and development department consisted of 29 dedicated employees. WiSA s engineering team has a wide range of expertise, capable of developing all levels of product design, from Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASIC to modules to finished products. WiSA research and development has and will continue developing trade secrets for Digital Signal Processing DSP ), RF design and testing of WiSA technologies. WiSA has developed multiple ASICs and certified modules for integration into multiple wireless audio designs by ODMs which are currently shipping to consumers. The ASIC hardware solution uses a high-performance proprietary network protocol for transmission of multi-channel audio. WiSA is also currently shipping and developing modules that are Wi-Fi compatible. The Software SW solution enables multi-channel audio capabilities on off the shelf IoT modules running RTOS and future Linux/Android based multimedia systems. The software solution uses a Wi-Fi network for transmission of multi-channel audio. WiSA released to production a low cost 2.4GHz IoT module supporting (5) audio channels and in the process of porting our software to a 5GHz IoT module in 2023. We have engaged an Indian design center to focus on Android integration of the core SW for embedded TV applications. Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment Our modules are designed and developed in Oregon, and our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China. Our manufacturing facilities have been ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified. We purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers; however, we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our modules. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. Our operations team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our modules and seeks to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components, while leveraging our contract manufacturers volume purchases for best pricing on common parts. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us meet our supply and support requirements. Our manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our devices in accordance with our purchase orders. Demand forecasts and manufacturing purchase orders are based upon customer orders, historical trends, and analysis from our sales and product management functions. We believe that our manufacturing capabilities are essential to maintaining and improving product quality and performance, and that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. While some modules are delivered from our production facility in Oregon, we have a third-party warehouse and fulfillment center in Hong Kong that delivers the majority our modules.

 Sales Channels and Customers WiSA sells modules and integrated circuits ICs directly to OEM brands worldwide which in turn, sell their system level products to end customers through a vast channel of retailers and dealer networks. Internationally known brands such as Bang Olufsen, Harman International, a division of Samsung, LG, System Audio, KEF, and many others are among our current customers, with products aimed at the wireless home theater market. Most of these brands sell through retailers store fronts and online e-tail. Marketing and Advertising Effective and consistent marketing and advertising is critical as we grow our wireless audio solutions. We have worked with multiple PR agencies on establishing effective messaging to face all segments within our category including press, brands, reviewers, retailers and consumers. Our focuses are ease of set-up, high quality performance, expandability and the benefits of a true multi-channel surround sound audio solutions. Competition The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Competitive products include products that: (a) are resistant to interference, low latency, long-range, and able to stream uncompressed audio; (b) target applications in the PC accessory audio, iPod accessory audio, home theater, and consumer enterprise voice markets; (c) enable smart TVs, computers and mobile devices to connect to their multiple peripherals wirelessly, and simultaneously from a single host, with the ability to mix-and-match peripherals; and (d) utilize Bluetooth technology as a means of transmission. We believe that our technology competes favorably with our competitors for a variety of reasons, including, among others: Our technology transmits audio packets with fixed latency in a manner well-suited for multi-channel audio networks and video applications. Our technology contains WiFi compatible software which provides the following future key benefits: o WiFi is not inherently proficient for transporting low latency audio. WiSA has spent the last 5 years developing a protocol that can leverage off the shelf high volume low cost 2.4GHz and 5GHz IoT chips and modules and scale to higher audio channel counts. As chip technology performance improves so will our performance. o WiFi compatibility allows us to operate more efficiently in congested environments while delivering the performance the market demands. o A software solution will allow WiSA Technologies to pivot into new markets quicker than those making custom proprietary chip solutions. 
 There are many other factors that impact our ability to be competitive and may impact our success against both larger and emerging competitors. Intellectual Property We have key IP assets, including patents and trade secrets developed based on our technical expertise. As of March 14, 2023, we had 13 issued and 10 pending U.S. patents covering our technology. Our currently issued patents expire at various times from September 25, 2027 through March 1, 2040. IP is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our IP as appropriate. A multi-channel audio for surround sound system has technical requirements not required by simple stereo only systems. Multi-channel systems require each audio channel to be precisely played in time to create a sound field that correlates to video being viewed by a consumer. WiSA has developed hardware and software core technologies that manage system network latency and speaker phase. WiSA s patents are based on protecting our low latency network algorithms and multi receiver synchronization.

 We pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the U.S. and occasionally in foreign countries where our customers manufacture, distribute, or sell licensed products. We actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technological innovations. We have multiple patents covering aspects and improvements for many of our technologies. Our trademarks cover our various products, technologies, improvements, and features, as well as the services that we provide. These trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program, and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications. We protect our IP rights both domestically and internationally. From time to time, we may experience problems with OEMs of consumer entertainment products in emerging economies. In the event it becomes necessary, we will take all necessary steps to enforce our IP rights. Moreover, we have relatively no issued patents outside the U.S. Growing our licensing revenue in developing countries may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent rights in these countries, which is uncertain. Further, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained, if any, is uncertain. Employees As of March 14, 2023, we had a total 49 employees working in the United States and internationally. In the United States, we had 46 employees, including 29 employees that work in our research and development department, 11 employees in our sales and marketing department, 1 employee that works in our manufacturing/logistics/fulfillment department and 5 employees that work in our general and administrative department. Additionally, we have one logistics employee and one sales employee in Taiwan. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Overview WiSA Technologies, Inc formerly known as Summit Wireless Technologies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries also referred to herein as we , us , our , or the Company was originally formed as a limited liability company in Delaware on July 23, 2010. Our business is to deliver the best-in-class immersive wireless sound technology for intelligent devices and next generation home entertainment systems through the sale of module components to audio companies as well as audio products to resellers and consumers. The address of our corporate headquarters is 15268 NW Greenbrier Pkwy, Beaverton, OR 97006. Our website address is www.wisatechnologies.com . The information contained in or accessible through our website is not part of this Report and is intended for informational purposes only. We are an early stage technology company and our primary business focus is to enable mainstream consumers and audio enthusiasts to experience high quality wireless audio. We intend to continue selling our proprietary wireless modules to consumer electronics

 companies while also expanding our focus to implement a lower cost solution by porting our software onto commercially available internet of things IoT modules with integrated Wi-Fi technology. Our technology addresses some of the main issues that we perceive are hindering the growth of the home theater: complexity of installation and cost. We believe that consumers want to experience theater quality surround sound from the comfort of their homes. However, wired home theater systems often require expensive audio-visual AV receivers to decode the audio stream, leaving the consumer with the burden of concealing the wires. Hiring a professional to hide the wires into the walls or floor is invasive, complicated, costly and time consuming. Further, people who rent as opposed to own may not be able to install these systems as the installation construction needed may not be permitted under a lease agreement. Our first-generation wireless technology addresses these problems by transmitting wireless audio to each speaker at Blu-ray quality (uncompressed 24-bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rates) and emphasizing ease of setup. To our knowledge, our custom chips and modules technology is one of the few technologies available today that can stream up to eight (8) separate wireless audio channels with low latency, removing lip-sync issues between the audio and video sources. In addition, every speaker within a system that utilizes our technology can be synchronized to less than one microsecond, thus eliminating phase distortion between speakers. Our first-generation technology shows that wireless home theater systems are viable home audio solutions for the average consumer and audio enthusiast alike. Current research and development investments focus on developing Wi-Fi compatible software for transmitting multichannel wireless audio for which patent applications have been submitted. A software solution enables smart devices that have Wi-Fi and video media to deliver surround sound audio and allows us to port our wireless audio technology to popular Wi-Fi based modules and systems on a chip SOC already shipping in volume. The WiSA Wireless Discovery module announced in January 2021 is the first IoT module solution with our embedded wireless audio software that supports up to four separate wireless audio channels and, we believe, reduces the cost per wireless channel by over 50 for soundbars and entry level home theater applications up to a 3.1 configuration. Our goal is to continue to commercialize and improve performance of a software based-solution, which other brands can integrate into their devices, that will (i) reduce integration costs for mass market use, (ii) utilize Wi-Fi for wireless connectivity, making it easy to integrate into today s high volume, low cost SOC and modules, (iii) provide a low power consumption option to allow for use in battery powered devices, and (iv) provide compatibility with popular consumer electronic operating systems. To date, our operations have been funded through sales of our common and preferred equity, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, sale of debt instruments, and revenue from the sale of our products. Our consolidated financial statements contemplate the continuation of our business as a going concern. However, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with an emerging business, as noted above we have no established source of capital, and we have incurred recurring losses from operations since inception. Continuing Impacts of the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations The COVID-19 pandemic represents a fluid situation that presents a wide range of potential impacts of varying durations for different global geographies, including locations where we have offices, employees, customers, vendors and other suppliers and business partners. Given the fact that our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels, we have experienced and we continue to expect that our sales will experience some volatility as a result of the changing and less predictable operational needs of many customers as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic as well as supply chain disruptions and the impacts of inflation. To date, we have experienced shipment delays from our suppliers due to COVID -19, which have not had a material adverse impact on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022. Although we have not directly experienced a material supply interruption, our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains as a result of COVID-19, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in delayed, reduced or canceled orders, or collection risks, and which have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience material supply delays or interruptions in the future due to COVID -19. To date, travel restrictions and border closures have not materially impacted our ability to obtain inventory or manufacture or deliver products or services to customers. However, if such restrictions become more severe, they could negatively impact those activities in a way that would harm our business over the long term. Travel restrictions impacting people can restrain our ability to assist our customers and distributors as well as impact our ability to develop new distribution channels, but at present we do not expect these restrictions on personal travel to be material to our business operations or financial results.

 Critical Accounting Policies The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies. We utilize the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) as allowed by Section 107(b)(1) of the JOBS Act for the adoption of new or revised accounting standards as applicable to emerging growth companies. As part of the election, we will not be required to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such time that a company that does not qualify as an issuer (as defined under Section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act, and we will utilize certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. For example, we will not have to provide an auditor s attestation report on our internal control in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to utilize this extended transition period. Our consolidated financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards as they become applicable to public companies. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3,365,000, a decrease of 3,176,000, or 49 , compared to the revenue of 6,541,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was a result of lower Component revenue which decreased by 3,189,000, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, offset partially by Consumer Audio Product sales which increased by 13,000, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in Component revenue was due in part to (i) a slow-down in consumer spending on consumer electronics which resulted in excess end product inventory at retailers and (ii) supply chain interruptions experienced by certain of our customers as a result of COVID-19, with their delaying orders to us until other components for their products could be obtained. Gross Profit and Operating Expenses Gross Profit Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 395,000 a decrease of 1,469,000 compared to 1,864,000 gross profit for the year ended December 31. 2021. The decrease in gross profit is mainly attributable to low volumes of Component sales. The gross margin as a percent of sales was 11.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 28.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 16.8 points. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due in part to (i) reduced sales volumes in comparison to the fixed portion of costs included in our manufacturing and (ii) the Company s fourth quarter 2022 price reductions of its consumer audio products in response to the slow down in consumer spending on consumer electronics. Research and Development Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 7,144,000, an increase of 1,908,000, compared to expenses of 5,236,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily related to increased salary and benefit expense of 874,000, increased stock-based compensation, professional and consulting expense and recruiting fees of 106,000, 783,000 and 95,000, respectively.

Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 898,000, compared to 9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of 889,000 in interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to the amortization of debt discounts associated with the senior secured convertible note in the principal amount of 3,600,000 (the Convertible Note that the Company incurred in August 2022. Minimal interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily related to interest accrued on the Paycheck Protection Loan which was forgiven in the third quarter of 2021. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability Change in fair value of warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 2,852,000, compared to 0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in fair value of the warrant liability for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to the issuance of warrants during December 2022 associated with our stock offering and the subsequent decrease in our common stock price at year end compared to the price of our stock on the date of the warrant issuance. Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability Change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 47,000, compared to 0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in fair value of the derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to the decrease in our common stock price. Gain on Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program Loan We recorded a gain of 859,000 due to the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Loan for the year ended December 31, 2021. No such forgiveness occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022. Warrant Inducement Expense Warrant inducement expense was 1,146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such warrant inducement expense represents the fair value of warrants issued to warrant holders in connection with a solicitation of such warrant holders to exercise their outstanding warrants during the year ended December 31, 2021. No such inducement expense occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022. Deemed Dividend on Exchange of Convertible Preferred Stock for Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of 1,192,000 in connection with the exchange of all 250,000 shares of preferred stock for 250,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 187,500 shares of common stock, which warrants were subsequently fully exercised on a cashless basis for 79,244 shares of common stock. No such deemed dividend occurred the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 were 2,897,000, compared to 13,108,000 as of December 31, 2021. We used net cash in operating activities of 17,514,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used net cash in operating activities of 11,508,000. Excluding the net loss and non-cash adjustments, the increase in the use of net cash from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily related to the increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. On August 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ), by and between the Company and an institutional investor (the Investor ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investor the Convertible Note and a warrant (the Warrant to purchase up to 20,970 shares of the Company s common stock, at an exercise price of 99.70 per share (the Exercise Price ), in consideration for 3,000,000. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the closing of the private placement of the Convertible Note and Warrant, pursuant to which Maxim acted as placement agent (the Private Placement ), the Company received gross proceeds of 3,000,000. After the deduction of banker fees, commitment fees and other expenses associated with the transaction, the Company received net proceeds of 2,483,000. On August 24, 2022, the Company and the Investor agreed to amend Section 3.1(b) of the Convertible Note to provide that the Conversion Price (as defined in the Convertible Note) could not be lower than 0.50 (the Floor Price until stockholder approval had been obtained, after which stockholder approval the Floor Price may be reduced to no lower than 0.25, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the August 2022 Note. The changes were effected by cancellation of the Convertible Note and the issuance of a replacement senior secured convertible note (the New Convertible Note to the Investor. The New Convertible Note contains identical terms as the Convertible Note, except for the amendment to the Section 3.1(b). The Convertible Note matures on August 15, 2024, does not bear interest and ranks senior to the Company s existing and future indebtedness and is secured to the extent and as provided in the security agreements entered into between the Investor and the Company. The Convertible Note is convertible in whole or in part at the option of the Investor into shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Shares at the Conversion Price (as defined in the Convertible Note) at any time following the date of issuance of the Convertible Note. As of December 31, 2022, the Convertible Note had an outstanding principal amount of 2,089,000. On December 1, 2022, WiSA consummated a public offering (the Offering of an aggregate of 504,000 units (the Units and 36,000 pre-funded units (the Pre-Funded Units at an effective public offering price of 14.00 per Unit, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 7.6 million. Each Unit consisted of (i) one share (the Shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), (ii) one Series A Warrant (the Series A Warrants ), and (iii) one Series B Warrant (the Series B Warrants and, together with the Series A Warrants, the Warrants ), each such Warrant being exercisable from time to time for one Share at an exercise price of 14.00 per share. Each Pre-Funded Unit consisted of (i) one pre-funded warrant (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), each such Pre-Funded Warrant being exercisable from time to time for one Share, (ii) one Series A Warrant and (iii) one Series B Warrant.

The Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercisable for one Share at an exercise price of 0.10 per share, and as of December 31, 2022 were exercised in full with no Pre-Funded Warrants remaining outstanding. We raised approximately 6.4 million in net proceeds from the Offering. Going Concern Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net operating losses each year since inception. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.9 million and reported net cash used in operations of 17.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. In September 2022, we entered into the ATM Program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM Program and the ATM Program was subsequently terminated in January 2023 (See Note 11 Subsequent Events for additional information). We expect operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to research and development activities, plans to expand our product portfolio, and increase our market share. Our ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. Based on current operating levels, we will need to raise additional funds during the next 12 months by selling additional equity or incurring debt (See Note 11 Subsequent Events for additional information). To date, we have funded our operations primarily through sales of its securities in public markets, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock and the sale of convertible

 notes. Additionally, future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the selling price of our products, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt. There can be no assurance that, in the event we requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital and reduce discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. As a result, the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The consolidated financial statements, notes to the consolidated financial statements and the respective report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm required to be filed in response to this Item 8 begin on page F-1. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, including this Report, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and was accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) ender the Exchange Act) includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management (with the participation of the CEO and CFO) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Company s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. This Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm because as a smaller reporting company we are not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections Not applicable.

Each Manager s Retention Bonus Amount is payable (if at all) on the earlier of the six-month anniversary of the date of a Change of Control or at the time of such Manager s involuntary termination other than for Cause (as defined in the Retention Plan) or termination for Good Reason (as defined in the Retention Plan).

Pursuant to such authority and the Retention Plan, on September 1, 2022, the Committee also approved aggregate Retention Bonus Amounts of 1,250,000. Among the managers deemed by the Committee to be eligible for such payments, the Committee approved Retention Bonus Amounts for the following Company named executive officers: Brett Moyer, Chief Executive Officer, 300,000; George Oliva, Chief Financial Officer, 200,000; and Gary Williams, Chief Accounting Officer and Vice President of Finance, 75,000. Equity Incentive Plans 2018 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan of the Company (the LTIP On January 30, 2018, the Board approved the establishment of the LTIP. The LTIP is intended to enable the Company to continue to attract able directors, employees, and consultants and to provide a means whereby those individuals upon whom the responsibilities rest for successful administration and management of the Company, and whose present and potential contributions are of importance, can acquire and maintain Common Stock ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for the Company s welfare. The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying options) that may be issued under the LTIP pursuant to awards of Restricted Shares or Options will be limited to 15 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, which calculation shall be made on the first trading day of each new fiscal year; provided that, in any year no more than 8 of the Common Stock or derivative securitization with Common Stock underlying 8 of the Common Stock may be issued in any fiscal year. For fiscal year 2022, up to 108,373 shares of Common Stock were available for participants under the LTIP. For fiscal year 2021, up to 23,746 shares of Common Stock were initially available for participants under the LTIP. The number of shares of Common Stock that are the subject of awards under the LTIP which are forfeited or terminated, are settled in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock or in a manner such that all or some of the shares covered by an award are not issued to a participant or are exchanged for awards that do not involve shares will again

At a special meeting of our stockholders held on January 24, 2023, our stockholders approved certain amendments to the LTIP to: (i) increase the annual share limit of Common Stock that may be issued in any single fiscal year only for the 2023 fiscal year under the LTIP from 8 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding to 15 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding (which amount equates to the maximum amount that may be issued in the aggregate under the LTIP); and (ii) permit immediately quarterly calculations based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the first trading day of each fiscal quarter, rather than solely as of the first trading day of the fiscal year. 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan On July 27, 2020, the Board approved the establishment of the 2020 Plan and the reservation of an aggregate of 650,000 shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan, subject to stockholder approval, which was obtained on October 20, 2020.

In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the Audit Committee, or disinterested directors, as applicable, will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate: (i) whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances; (ii) the nature and extent of the related party s interest in the transaction; (iii) the material terms of the transactions; (iv) the importance of the transaction both to the Company and to the related party; (v) in the case of a transaction involving an executive officer or director, whether the transaction would interfere with the performance of such person s duties to the Company; and (vi) in the case of a transaction involving a non-employee director or a nominee for election as a non-employee director (or their immediate family member), whether the transaction would disqualify the director or nominee from being deemed an independent director, as defined by Nasdaq, and whether the transaction would disqualify the individual from serving on the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee or other committees of the Board under applicable Nasdaq and other regulatory requirements.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of WiSA Technologies, Inc. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WiSA Technologies, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity(deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern Uncertainty The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that WiSA Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s recurring losses from operations, a net capital deficiency, available cash and cash used in operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016. /s/ March 16, 2023

 million and reported net cash used in operations of million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company expects operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to research and development activities, plans to expand its product portfolio, and increase its market share. The Company s ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. Based on current operating levels, the Company will need to raise additional funds in the next 12 months by selling additional equity or incurring debt. To date, the Company has funded its operations primarily through sales of its securities in public markets, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock and the sale of convertible notes. Additionally, future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the selling price of the Company s products, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of the Company s products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of this report. Management of the Company intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt. There can be no assurance that, in the event the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital and reduce discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. As a result, the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company primarily considered such factors as the Company s history of operating losses; the nature of the Company s deferred tax assets and the timing, likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible. At present, the Company does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a full valuation allowance was maintained, and no deferred tax assets were shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance increased by and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). The CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to the tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. On December 21, 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidation Appropriations Act, 2021 (the CAA Act ). The tax provisions under the CARES Act and CAA Act, do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements given the existence of a full valuation allowance. The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP Loan ). Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP Loan. On May 3, 2020, the Company received the PPP loan from Wells Fargo Bank. During the third quarter of 2021, the full amount of the PPP Loan was forgiven. The CARES Act specifically requires taxpayers to exclude canceled indebtedness from gross income, and, accordingly, the debt forgiveness amount was treated as nontaxable. On June 29, 2020, California Assembly Bill 85 AB 85 was signed into law, which suspends the use of California net operating losses and limits the use of California research tax credits for tax years beginning in 2020 and before 2023. However, on February 9, 2022 California Senate Bill 113 SB 113 was signed into law and removed the limitation on the net operating losses and credits for the 2022 year and allows, after taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the ability to utilize net operating losses and credits. These changes did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of a possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. The Company s management does not believe that any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a materially adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
