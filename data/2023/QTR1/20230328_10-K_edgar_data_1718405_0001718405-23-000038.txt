 PART I 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 About the Company 
 Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (formerly known as Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 28, 2017. In this 2022 Form 10-K, we , us , our , the Company , Hycroft , and "HYMC" refer to Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries. We are a U.S.-based gold and silver development company that owns the Hycroft Mine in the prolific mining region of Northern Nevada. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements Notes included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements of this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 On May 29, 2020, we, consummated a business combination transaction (the Recapitalization Transaction that resulted in MUDS Acquisition Sub, Inc. Acquisition Sub acquiring all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the direct subsidiaries of Hycroft Mining Corporation Seller and substantially all of the other assets of Seller and assuming substantially all of the liabilities of Seller. In conjunction with the Recapitalization Transaction, Seller s indebtedness existing prior to the Recapitalization Transaction was either repaid, exchanged for indebtedness of the Company, exchanged for shares

of common stock or converted into shares of Seller common stock, and our post-Recapitalization Transaction indebtedness included amounts drawn under the Credit Agreement among MUDS, MUDS Holdco Inc., Allied VGH LLC, Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC Sprott Private Resource Lending II (Collector) Inc., and Sprott Resources Lending Corp. Sprott Credit Agreement and the assumption of the newly issued 10 Senior Secured Notes Subordinated Notes ). 
 
 Our property, the Hycroft Mine, has historically operated as an open-pit oxide mining and heap leach processing operation and is located approximately 54 miles northwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. Mining operations at the Hycroft Mine were restarted in 2019 on a pre-commercial scale and discontinued in November 2021 as a result of the then current and expected ongoing cost pressures for many of the reagents and consumables used at the Hycroft Mine and to further determine the most effective processing method for the sulfide ore. In March 2023, Hycroft, along with its third-party consultants, completed and filed the Hycroft Property Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary Humboldt and Pershing Counties, Nevada with an effective date of March 27, 2023 (the 2023 Hycroft TRS and prepared in accordance with the SEC s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants as set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K Modernization Rules ). The 2023 Hycroft TRS provides an initial assessment of the mineral resource estimate utilizing a milling and pressure oxidation POX process for sulfide mineralization and heap leaching process for oxide and transition mineralization. The 2023 Hycroft TRS included: (i) additional exploration drilling results from 2021 and 2022; (ii) additional assay information associated with historical drilling that was previously missing; (iii) other updates after additional review of historical assay certificates; and (iv) other adjustments. The 2023 Hycroft TRS supersedes and replaces the Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary for the Hycroft Mine, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules, with an effective date of February 18, 2022 2022 Hycroft TRS and the 2022 Hycroft TRS should no longer be relied upon. Our ongoing disclosures and many of management s estimates and judgements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022 are based on the 2023 Hycroft TRS. The Company will continue to build on the work to date and investigate opportunities identified through progressing the technical and data analyses leading up to the 2023 Hycroft TRS and will provide an updated technical report at an appropriate time. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed processing of gold and silver ore previously placed on leach pads prior to ceasing mining operations in November 2021 and we sold 17,728 ounces of gold and 44,084 ounces of silver. As of December 31, 2022, the Hycroft Mine had measured and indicated mineral resources of 10.6 million ounces of gold and 360.7 million ounces of silver and inferred mineral resources of 3.4 million ounces of gold and 96.1 million ounces of silver, w hich are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores. 
 Segment Information 
 The Hycroft Mine is our only operating segment and includes the operations, development, and exploration activities and accounts for 100 of our Revenues and Production costs . Corporate and Other includes corporate General and administrative costs. See Note 19 Segment Information to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments. 
 Principal Products, Revenues, and Market Overview 
 The principal products produced during 2022 and 2021 at the Hycroft Mine were unrefined gold and silver bars (dor and gold and silver laden carbons and slags, both of which were sent to third party refineries and sold at prevailing spot prices after adjustments for refining and other associated fees, to financial institutions or to precious metals traders. Dor bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags were sent to refineries to produce bullion that meet the required market standards of 99.95 pure gold and 99.90 pure silver. Under the terms of our refining agreements, dor bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags were refined for a fee, and our share of the separately recovered refined gold and refined silver were credited to our account or delivered to our buyers. 
 Product Revenues and Customers 
 In 2022, Revenues from gold and silver recovered from our pre-commercial scale heap leaching operations made up 97 and 3 , respectively, of our total revenue and, as such, we consider gold our principal product. In 2022, all of our Revenues were derived from metal sales to three customers; however, we do not believe we have any dependencies on these customers due to the liquidity of the metal markets and the availability of other metal buyers and financial institutions. As the Company ceased active mining operations in November 2021 and completed the processing of gold and silver ounces from the leach pads, we do not expect to have significant Revenues from gold and silver sales until restarting mining operations.

Gold and Silver Uses 
 Gold and silver have two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and coins. Fabricated silver also has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, mirrors, cameras, electronics, energy, engines, novelty explosives and coins. Gold and silver investors buy gold and silver bullion, coins and jewelry. 
 Gold and Silver Supply and Demand 
 The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and metal recycling and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. Based on publicly available information published by the World Gold Council, gold production from mines increased 1.2 in 2022 compared with 2021 totaling approximately 3,612 metric tons (or 116.1 million troy ounces) and represented approximately 75.9 of the 2022 global gold supply of 4,755 metric tons. According to the World Gold Council, gold demand in 2022 was approximately 4,741 metric tons (or 152.4 million troy ounces) and totaled approximately 274.4 billion in value. In 2022, gold demand by sector was comprised of jewelry (46 ), investments including bar and coin and ETFs (23 ), central bank purchases (24 ), and technology (7 ). 
 
 The supply of silver consists of a combination of current production from mining (approximately 82 and metal recycling and other (approximately 18 ). Based on publicly available information, estimated silver production from mines increased approximately 2.5 in 2022 compared with 2021 totaling approximately 843 million troy ounces and represented approximately 82 of the 2022 global silver supply of 1,030 million troy ounces. Silver demand in 2022 was approximately 1,101 million troy ounces and totaled approximately 26.3 billion in value. In 2022, silver demand by sector was comprised of photovoltaics (12 ), other industrial (37 ), jewelry (18 ), silverware (5 ), photography (3 ), and investments (25 ). 
 Gold and Silver Prices 
 The price of gold and silver is volatile and is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation and monetary policies, fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold and silver producing countries throughout the world. The following table presents the annual high, low, and average afternoon fix prices for gold and silver over the past three years on the London Bullion Market (in U.S. dollars per ounce). 
 GOLD PRICES SILVER PRICES Year High Low Average High Low Average 2020 2,067 1,474 1,770 28.89 12.01 20.55 2021 1,943 1,684 1,799 29.59 21.53 25.04 2022 2,039 1,628 1,800 26.18 17.77 21.71 2023 (through Mar. 24th) 1,994 1,811 1,884 24.44 20.09 22.48 
 On March 24, 2023, the afternoon fix price for gold and silver on the London Bullion Market was 1,994 per ounce and 23.17 per ounce, respectively. 
 Competition 
 The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately one third of total worldwide mined gold production. We are a gold and silver development company with a single property. The Hycroft Mine has large gold and silver mineral resources included in the 2023 Hycroft TRS. We have not fully developed our milling and POX operations and we have not established our long-term production and cost structure. Our costs are expected to be determined by the location, grade and nature of our ore body, processing technologies applied to our ore, and costs including energy, reagents, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long-term is based on our ability to develop and cost effectively operate the Hycroft Mine in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. 
 We compete with other mining companies in connection with hiring and retaining qualified employees. There is substantial competition for qualified employees in the mining industry, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than us and a more stable history. As a result, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors Industry Related Risks The Company faces intense competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees , for additional discussion related to our current and potential competition.

Employees 
 At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 74 employees, of which 64 were employed at the Hycroft Mine. None of our employees are represented by unions. 
 We believe the miner is the most important thing to come out of a mine and we support that belief through our philosophy of continuous improvement. Our mandated mine safety and health programs include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation, and program auditing. These programs are a focus for our leadership and top management and are essential at all levels to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors operate safely. 
 One of the metrics we use to measure our safety performance is the industry standard Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate TRIFR ). The Hycroft Mine s TRIFR per 200,000 man-hours worked (including contractors) was Nil (0.00) at the end of 2022, as compared to 0.64 at the end of 2021 and the mining industry average of approximately 2.02 for 2022. In 2021, we recruited new leadership from strong safety cultures in the mining industry that helped us successfully rebuild the Hycroft Mine safety culture utilizing elements in advanced safety practices and management making them the cornerstone for our safety success. We emphasize safety as a cornerstone of our corporate culture and continue with the practices, and people to elevate our safety performance in all site activities. During 2022 we continued to focus our efforts on safety with enhanced and expanded activities to further develop and reinforce our safety culture. 
 COVID-19 
 We have implemented health and safety policies for employees, contractors, and visitors that follow guidelines from the Center for Disease Control CDC and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). During 2022 and 2021, our operations faced certain limitations due to COVID-19 related absences, however the impact, while negative, did not materially and adversely affect our operations. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors Industry Related Risks The on-going effects of the coronavirus pandemic may adversely impact our business and financial condition , as well as Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion related to COVID-19. 
 Government Regulation of Mining-Related Activities 
 Government Regulation 
 Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our current mining, exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in Nevada and the United States. Although we are not aware of any current claims, orders or directions relating to our business with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations, changes to, or more stringent application, interpretation, or enforcement of, such laws and regulations in Nevada, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs, which could adversely impact the profitability levels of our projects. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Our mining projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The federal laws and regulations, among other things: 
 impose strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended CERCLA )); 
 govern the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste (the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended RCRA )); 
 restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including mining and processing activities (the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended (the Clean Air Act )); 
 8 

Table of Contents 

require federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including the issuance of permits to mining facilities and assessing alternatives to these actions (the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, as amended NEPA )); 
 regulate the use of federal public lands to prevent undue and unnecessary degradation of the public lands (the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (the FLPMA )); 
 restrict and control the discharge of pollutants and dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States (the Clean Water Act of 1972, as amended (the Clean Water Act )); and 
 regulate the drilling of subsurface injection wells (the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended (the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Underground Injection Control Program promulgated thereunder). 
 We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, to federal laws or regulations may be adopted or imposed by the current governmental administration. At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Protection (the Division ), which has the authority to implement and enforce many of the federal regulatory programs described above as well as state environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals, delays in beginning or expanding operations, limitations on production levels, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of fines, penalties or remediation costs for non-compliance, and post-mining closure, reclamation and bonding. 
 It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards our employees, public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are, and will be, conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, our past and future activities in the United States may cause us to be subject to liability under such laws and regulations. For information about the risks to our business related to environmental regulation, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors Industry Related Risks : 
 Our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed; 
 Changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect our cost of operations or result in operations delays; 
 Environmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability; and 
 Our exploration and development operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a notice of non-compliance from the closure branch of the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection NDEP Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation BMRR regarding a historical reclamation matter. As such, the Company has accelerated certain reclamation activities in order to regain compliance. During 2021, there was no known material non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by us. During 2022 and 2021, there were no known material environmental incidents. We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2022 and 2021 and we do not expect to incur any material expenditures in 2023 for such environmental control facilities. 
 Reclamation 
 We are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by amending, backfilling, stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing are completed, mitigating potential impacts to surface water and groundwater resources. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Our reclamation obligations at the Hycroft Mine are secured by surface management surety bonds that meet the financial assurance requirements of the State of Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management BLM ). Our most recent reclamation cost estimate was approved by the BLM and the State of Nevada in July 2020. As of December 31, 2022, our surface management surety bonds totaled 58.7 million, of which 58.3 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the Hycroft Mine, and 0.4 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the adjacent water supply well field and exploration within the project boundary. The Company began performing reclamation activities on its Crofoot leach pad beginning in 2022 and expects to complete the reclamation activities in 2028. No additional material reclamation expenditures are expected to be incurred until after mining and mineral processing are completed. If we incur additional long-term environmental impacts from future mining activities, we will likely have additional reclamation obligations as well as additional financial assurance requirements. For our existing obligations, as well as any future obligations we may incur we may choose to engage in reclamation activities before mining and mineral processing are completed, but these expenses are not anticipated to be material to the overall reclamation obligation. When we perform reclamation work in the future, the work will be planned to conform to our mining operations and will be required to be

documented when completed under our governing permits with the government regulatory agencies. The reclamation obligation would be adjusted accordingly as allowed under current regulations, and the financial assurance requirements would be adjusted to account for the completed reclamation work. If we are required to comply with material unanticipated financial assurance requirements in the future, our financial position could be adversely affected, or our posted financial assurance may be insufficient. For financial information about our estimated future reclamation costs, see Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligation to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration Regulations 
 Safety and health are core values which is why we have mandatory mine safety and health programs that include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. We consider these programs to be essential at all levels within Hycroft to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors only operate in a safe and healthy workplace. 
 Our operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act ). Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the Dodd-Frank Act ), issuers are required to disclose specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities in periodic reports. MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. The number of citations and orders charged against mining operations in the U.S., and the dollar penalties assessed for such citations, have generally increased in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to provide certain mine safety disclosure, which we have done in Part I Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure s of this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 Property Interests and Mining Claims 
 Our development activities are conducted in the State of Nevada. Mineral interests in Nevada may be owned by the United States, the State of Nevada, or private parties. Where prospective mineral properties are held by the United States, mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land. Where prospective mineral properties are owned by the State of Nevada or private parties, some type of property acquisition agreement or access agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests. Additionally, mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained and, therefore, possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim. For general information about our mineral properties and mining claims, see Item 2. Properties . For information about the risks to our business related to our property interests and mining claims, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors Industry Related Risks : 
 There are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations; 
 Legislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of our operations on our unpatented mining claims or the amount of Net Proceeds Mineral Tax we pay to the State of Nevada.

 Risks Related to Changes in the Hycroft Mine s Operations 
 The Company has mineral resources at the Hycroft Mine, but the mine may not be brought into production . 
 The Company is not currently conducting commercial mining operations at the Hycroft Mine. There is no certainty that the mineral resources estimated at the Hycroft Mine will be mined or, if mined, processed profitably. The Company has no specific plans and cannot currently predict when the Hycroft Mine may be back in production. The commercial viability of the Hycroft Mine is dependent on many factors, including metal prices, the availability of and ability to raise capital for development, government policy and regulation and environmental protection, which are beyond the Company s control. The Company may not generate commercial-scale revenues until the Hycroft Mine is back in production. 
 The figures for the Company s mineral resources are estimates based on interpretation and assumptions and the Hycroft Mine may yield less mineral production or less profit under actual conditions than is currently estimated. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, mineral resource figures in the Company s filings with the SEC, press releases, and other public statements made from time to time are based upon estimates made by the Company s personnel and independent geologists. These estimates are imprecise and depend upon geologic interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be inaccurate. There can be no assurance that mineral resources or other mineralization figures will be accurate or that this mineralization could be mined or processed profitably. 
 Because the Company has not completed a feasibility study or recommenced commercial production at the Hycroft Mine, mineral resource estimates may require adjustments or downward revisions based upon further exploration or advancement 
 12 

Table of Contents 

work or actual production experience. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately mined, if any, may differ from that indicated by drilling results. There can be no assurance that recovery of minerals in small-scale tests will be duplicated in large-scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. 
 Until mineral resources are mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineral resources may vary depending on metal prices, which largely determine whether mineral resources are classified as ore (economic to mine) or waste (uneconomic to mine). Current mineral resource estimates were calculated using sales prices of 1,900 per ounce of gold price and 24.50 per ounce of silver. A material decline in the current price of gold or silver or material changes in processing methods or cost assumptions could require a reduction in mineral resource estimates. Any material reductions in estimates of mineral resources, or of the Company s ability to upgrade these mineral resources to mineral reserves and extract these mineral resources, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s prospects, and restrict its ability to successfully implement strategies for long-term growth. In addition, the Company cannot provide assurances that gold and silver recoveries experienced in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. 
 The Company has not completed a feasibility study for the proposed processing method for the Hycroft Mine and actual capital costs, operating costs, production, and economic returns may differ significantly from those the Company has anticipated. There are no assurances future advancement activities by the Company, if any, will lead to a favorable feasibility study or profitable mining operations . 
 
 The Company completed and issued the 2023 Hycroft TRS which replaced the 2022 Hycroft TRS. The 2023 Hycroft TRS provides an initial assessment of the mineral resource estimate and is not a feasibility study for the Hycroft Mine. Typically, a company will not make a production decision until it has completed a feasibility study. Feasibility studies derive estimates of cash operating costs based upon, among other things: 
 anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of the mineral reserves to be mined and processed; 
 anticipated recovery rates of gold and other metals from the mineral reserves; 
 cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and 
 anticipated climatic conditions and environmental protection measures. 
 Completing a feasibility study for the Hycroft Mine will require significant additional work and study to reduce the range of uncertainty associated with the study s estimates and conclusions. Cash operating costs, production, and economic returns, and other estimates contained in studies or estimates prepared by or for the Company may differ significantly from those anticipated by the Company. In addition, if estimated costs are too high, there may be further delays or a cancellation of advancement at the Hycroft Mine. 
 There is no certainty that a feasibility study for the Hycroft Mine will be completed or, if completed, that it will result in sufficiently favorable estimates of the economic viability of the Hycroft Mine to justify a construction decision. 
 The Company may not be able to successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals. 
 The Company currently has no commercial mining operations or sustaining revenue from the exploration, development and care and maintenance operations currently conducted at the Hycroft Mine. Mineral exploration and advancement involve a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The future advancement of the Hycroft Mine will require obtaining permits and financing and the construction and operation of the mine, processing plants, and related infrastructure. The Company s ability to establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals from the Hycroft Mine will be affected by: 
 timing and cost, which can be considerable, of the construction of additional mining and processing facilities; 
 availability and costs of skilled labor and mining equipment; 
 availability and cost of appropriate refining arrangements; 
 necessity to obtain additional environmental and other governmental approvals and permits, and the timing of those approvals and permits; 
 availability of funds to finance equipment purchases, construction, and advancement activities; 
 management of an increased workforce and coordination of contractors; 
 potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, or local groups, which may delay or prevent advancement activities; and 
 13 

Table of Contents 

potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, labor, materials and supplies and foreign exchange rates. 
 It is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during advancement, construction, start-up commissioning, and transition to commercial operations. In addition, delays in the commencement of mineral production often occur. Accordingly, there are no assurances that, if the Company decides to initiate construction or mining activities, that it will be able to successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce gold and silver at the Hycroft Mine. 
 Industry-Related Risks 
 The market prices of gold and silver are volatile. A decline in gold or silver prices could result in decreased revenues, decreased net income, increased losses, and decreased cash inflows which may negatively affect the business. 
 Gold and silver are commodities. Their prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond the Company s control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, central bank activities, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. The prices of gold and silver, as quoted by The London Bullion Market Association on December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were 1,813.75 and 1,805.85 per ounce for gold, respectively, and 23.945 and 23.085 per ounce for silver, respectively. The prices of gold and silver may decline in the future. A substantial or extended decline in gold or silver prices would adversely impact the Company s financial position. In addition, sustained lower gold or silver prices may materially adversely affect the Company s business, including: 
 halting, delaying, modifying, or canceling plans for the mining of oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores or the development of new and existing projects; 
 reducing existing mineral resources by removing ore from mineral resources that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices; and 
 causing the Company to recognize an impairment to the carrying values of its long-lived assets. 
 The Company faces intense competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and contractors. 
 The mining industry is intensely competitive for employees and contractors, and includes several large established mining companies with substantial mining capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than the Company s. The Company competes with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees as well as contractors. If unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees and contractors, the Company s exploration and development programs and/or operations may be slowed or suspended, which may materially adversely impact the Company s financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The Company cannot be certain that future development activities will be commercially successful. 
 Substantial expenditures are required to construct and operate the Hycroft Mine including additional equipment and infrastructure that is typically seen in milling and POX operations to allow for extraction of gold and silver from the sulfide mineral resource, to further develop the Hycroft Mine to establish mineral reserves and identify new mineral resources through exploration drilling and analysis. In 2023, the Company expects to continue to advance its POX evaluation reflected in the 2023 Hycroft TRS. In conjunction with the 2023 Hycroft TRS, the Company intends to focus its technical efforts for 2023 on, among other things, (1) completing metallurgical testing including bench top autoclave tests and reviewing the results thereof; (2) following-up on higher grades encountered during the 2021 drill program to improve the overall grade of mineral resources; and (3) assessing the potential to convert material currently considered waste and upgrade inferred material to a higher resource classification in the designed pits through Phase 2 of the 2022-2023 exploration drill program. The Company cannot provide any assurance that an economic process can be developed for the sulfide mineral resource using POX or other similar sulfide extraction processes, that any mineral resources discovered will be in sufficient quantities and grades to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely or economic basis. 
 Several factors, including costs, actual mineralization, consistency and reliability of ore grades, and commodity and reagent quantities and prices affect successful project development. The efficient operation of processing facilities, the existence of competent operational management, as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development. The Company can provide no assurance that the development and advancement of the Hycroft Mine sulfide processing operations will result in economically viable mining operations.

The Company s reliance on third-party contractors and consultants to conduct exploration and development projects exposes the Company to risks. 
 In connection with the exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine, the Company contracts and engages third party contractors and consultants to assist with aspects of the projects. As a result, the Company is subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside its control, including: 
 negotiating agreements with contractors and consultants on acceptable terms; 
 the inability to replace a contractor or consultant and their operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement; 
 reduced control over those aspects of exploration or development operations which are the responsibility of the contractor or consultant; 
 failure of a contractor or consultant to perform under their agreement or disputes relative to their performance; 
 interruption of exploration or development operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor or consultant ceases their business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events; 
 failure of a contractor or consultant to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent they are responsible for such compliance; and 
 problems of a contractor or consultant with managing their workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues. 
 In addition, the Company may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of contractors or consultants. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could increase the Company s costs, interrupt or delay exploration or development activities or the ability to access its mineral resources, and materially adversely affect the Company s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. 
 A shortage of equipment and supplies and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at the Hycroft Mine could adversely affect the Company s ability to operate. 
 The Company is dependent on various supplies and equipment to engage in exploration and development activities. The shortage of supplies, equipment, and parts and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at the Hycroft Mine could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to explore and develop the Hycroft Mine. Such shortages could also result in increased costs and cause delays in exploration and development projects. 
 Mining development and processing operations pose inherent risks and costs that may negatively impact the Company s business. 
 Mining development and processing operations involve many hazards and uncertainties, including, among others: 
 metallurgical or other processing problems; 
 ground or slope failures; 
 industrial accidents; 
 unusual and unexpected rock formations or water conditions; 
 environmental contamination or leakage; 
 flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of nature; 
 fires; 
 seismic activity; 
 pandemics adversely affecting the availability of workforces and supplies; 
 mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems; and 
 availability of skilled labor, critical materials, equipment, reagents, and consumable items. 
 These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company s properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in future mining or processing, increased future production costs, long-lived asset impairments, monetary losses and legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on future development plans, the Company s ability to raise additional capital, and/or the Company s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Environmental regulations could require the Company to make significant expenditures or expose the Company to potential liability. 
 To the extent the Company becomes subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities, or the costs that may be incurred, including costs to remedy environmental pollution, would reduce funds otherwise available to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If unable to fully remedy an environmental violation or release of hazardous substances, the Company might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy or corrective action. The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site can vary and may impact the cost of remediation. Actual remedial costs may exceed the financial accruals that have been made for such remediation. Additionally, the timing of the remedial costs may be materially different from the current remediation plan. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property or natural resources and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of the Company s past and current operations, which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties, injunctive relief and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including those required to restore the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in mining operations. The Company cannot provide any assurance that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have a material negative effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Company relies upon numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain, and the Company may not be able to obtain or renew all of the required permits, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for the current limited operations at the Hycroft Mine. Additional governmental permits are needed to accomplish the long-term plans to mine sulfide ores under plans yet to be developed. Obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving costly undertakings by the Company. The duration and success of efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within the Company s control, including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review. The Company may be unable to obtain or renew necessary permits on a timely basis or at all, and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company s estimates. Failure to comply with permit terms may result in injunctions, fines, suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties. The Company can provide no assurance that it has been, or will at all times be, in full compliance with all of the terms of its permits or that the Company has all required permits. The costs and delays associated with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could alter all or a portion of any mine plan proposed in the future, delay or stop the Company from proceeding with the development of the Hycroft Mine or increase the costs of development or production, any or all of which may materially adversely affect the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 Failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in penalties and costs. 
 While the Company is not conducting active mining operations at the Hycroft Mine, the facilities and prior operations have been and are, and the Company s future development plans may continue to be, subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation, including those enacted under the following laws: 
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended; 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended; 
 Clean Air Act of 1963, as amended; 
 National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, as amended; 
 Clean Water Act of 1972, as amended; 
 Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended; 
 Federal Land Policy and Land Management Act of 1976, as amended; and 
 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940, as amended. 
 Additional regulatory authorities may also have or have had jurisdiction over some of the Company s operations and mining projects including the Environmental Protection Agency, NDEP, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, BLM, and the Nevada Department of Wildlife NDOW ). 
 16 

Table of Contents 

These environmental regulations require the Company to obtain various permits, approvals and licenses and also impose standards and controls relating to development and production activities. For instance, the Company is required to hold a Nevada Reclamation Permit with respect to the Hycroft Mine. This permit mandates concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and requires the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Changes to the amount required to be posted for reclamation bonds could materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for development. For example, the Company had to obtain certain permits associated with mining in the area of an eagle habitat. Failure to obtain such required permits or failure to comply with federal and state regulations could also result in delays in beginning or expanding exploration, future operations, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of penalties for non-compliance or discharge of pollutants, and post-mining closure, reclamation, and bonding, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial performance, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Compliance with current and future government regulations may cause the Company to incur significant costs. 
 Mining operations are subject to extensive federal and state legislation governing matters such as mine safety, occupational health, labor standards, prospecting, exploration, production, exports, toxic and hazardous substances, explosives, management of natural resources, land use, water use, air emissions, waste disposal, environmental review, and taxes. While the Company has ceased mining operations at the Hycroft Mine, continued compliance with these regulations and other legislation relating to regulation obligations with respect to the Hycroft Mine and its future exploration and development could require significant financial outlays to comply with these laws. The enactment of new legislation or more stringent enforcement of current legislation may also increase these costs, which could have a material negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. The Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to adapt to these regulatory developments on a timely or cost-effective basis. Violations of these laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements could lead to substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, including possible shutdown of future operations, as applicable. 
 There are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause the Company to lose its rights in mineral properties and jeopardize the business. 
 The Hycroft Mine consists of private mineral rights, leases covering private lands, leases of patented mining claims, and unpatented mining claims. Areas of the Hycroft Mine are unpatented mining claims located on lands administered by the BLM Nevada State office to which the Company has only possessory title. Because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims. These uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper location and posting and marking of boundaries, and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. The Company believes a substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, and this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry. 
 The present status of the Company s unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows the Company the right to mine and remove valuable minerals, such as precious and base metals, from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs. The Company is generally allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. However, legal ownership of the land remains with the United States. The Company remains at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the United States or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements. Prior to 1994, a mining claim locator who was able to prove the discovery of valuable, locatable minerals on a mining claim, and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims, had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the mining claim from the Federal government. The right to pursue a patent, however, has been subject to a moratorium since October 1994, through federal legislation restricting the BLM from accepting any new mineral patent applications. If the Company does not obtain fee title to its unpatented mining claims, the Company can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain compensation in connection with the forfeiture of such claims. 
 There may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which the Company holds a material interest. If there are title defects with respect to any properties, the Company may be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce its interest in the affected property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management s time from ongoing business operations.

The Company s insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the business. 
 The mining industry is subject to risks and hazards, including, but not limited to, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, slide-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, equipment or facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, long-lived asset impairments, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many of these risks is not generally available to the Company and if it is, the Company may elect not to obtain it because of the high premium costs or commercial impracticality. Any liabilities incurred for these risks and hazards could be significant and could materially and adversely affect the Company s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. 
 Legislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of mine development on the Company s unpatented mining claims. 
 Members of the U.S. Congress have periodically introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the Mining Law of 1872. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims. Such proposed legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact the Company s ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims. A majority of the Company s mining claims at the Hycroft Mine are unpatented claims. Although the Company is unable to predict what legislated royalties might be, the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of the Company s unpatented mining claims and the economics of any future mine operations on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could materially adversely affect the Company s financial performance and results of operations. 
 Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could materially increase the Company s costs, and the costs of its suppliers, for further exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact the Company s ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such regulations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, the Company cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect its financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness, and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by the Company or other companies in the mining industry could cause reputational harm. 
 Climate change could have an adverse impact on the Company s cost of operations. 
 The potential physical impacts of climate change on the Company s development activities or future operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the areas in which the Company operates. These climate changes may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, and changing temperatures. These changes in climate could materially adversely affect mining operations, including by affecting the moisture levels and pH of ore on leach pads, could materially and adversely affect the cost to construct and operate the Hycroft Mine, and materially and adversely affect the Company s financial performance and operations. 
 The on-going effects of the coronavirus pandemic may adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have largely abated. However, the remaining on-going effects are uncertain. In the future, the pandemic could begin worsening again in the U.S. and elsewhere, creating renewed uncertainty. The worsening of the current COVID-19 pandemic could continue to, and future similar epidemics or pandemics could also, materially and negatively impact the Company s business including without limitation, employee health, workforce productivity, insurance premiums, ability to travel, the availability of industry experts and personnel, restrictions or delays to current and future drill and work programs and/or the timing to process drilling and other metallurgical testing, and other factors that will depend on future developments beyond the Company s control, which may have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the Company s financial condition and results could be adversely and materially impacted due to pandemic closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains, and credit losses when vendors or counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to the Company.

Business-Related Risks 
 The Company will need to raise additional capital, but such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
 The exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine for mining and processing mineral resources will require significant investment. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration, development, or production at the Hycroft Mine. The covenants in the Sprott Credit Agreement could significantly limit the Company s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities, increase the cost of borrowing, and make it difficult or impossible to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. 
 The Company s primary future cash requirements for 2023 will be to fund working capital needs, capital and project expenditures, satisfying debt service required under the Sprott Credit Agreement, and other corporate expenses so the Company can continue to develop the Hycroft Mine by conducting targeted exploration drilling and completing the necessary technical studies to determine the likely timeline to bring the sulfide mineral resources into commercial scale operation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrestricted cash of 142.0 million. Stockholders are cautioned that expectations regarding the Company s liquidity and capital resources are based on a number of assumptions that are believed to be reasonable but could prove to be incorrect. For example, the Company s expectations are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, anticipated costs and other factors that are subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond the Company s control. If the Company s assumptions prove to be incorrect, it may require additional financing sooner than expected to continue to operate the business, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
 If the Company loses key personnel or is unable to attract and retain additional personnel, the Company may be unable to develop the business. 
 The Company s development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees, specifically, Diane Garrett, its President and Chief Executive Officer, Stanton Rideout, its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other key employees the Company may hire in the future. The Company will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain its operations. If the Company is unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons, the Company s development and growth plans could be significantly curtailed. 
 The Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit the Company s ability to operate its business. 
 The Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. These restrictions limit the Company s ability and the ability of restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, as applicable: 
 incur additional debt; 
 pay dividends or make other restricted payments, including certain investments; 
 create or permit certain liens; 
 sell assets; 
 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and 
 consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or transfer all or substantially all of the Company s assets or the assets of its restricted subsidiaries. 
 These restrictions could limit the Company s ability to finance future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. 
 In addition, the Sprott Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with a number of customary covenants, including: 
 covenants related to the delivery of monthly, quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements, budgets and annual projections; 
 maintaining required insurance; 
 compliance with laws (including environmental); 
 compliance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA 
 maintenance of ownership of 100 of the Hycroft Mine; 
 19 

Table of Contents 

restrictions on consolidations, mergers or sales of assets; 
 limitations on liens; 
 limitations on issuance of certain equity interests; 
 limitations on issuance of additional indebtedness; 
 limitations on transactions with affiliates; and 
 other customary covenants. 
 The Company has received several waivers to date from covenant obligations under the Sprott Credit Agreement. The Company can make no assurances that it will satisfy these covenants or that its lenders will continue to waive any future failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants under the Sprott Credit Agreement could result in a default. See Note 10 Debt, Net to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information. If a default occurs under the Sprott Credit Agreement and/or the Royalty Agreement among the Company, Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO) Inc. (the Sprott Royalty Agreement ), the lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which, in the case of the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement, constitutes all or substantially all of the Company s assets. 
 The Company s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had substantial outstanding indebtedness under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. Subject to the limits and terms contained in the Sprott Credit Agreement, if the Company is unable to incur additional debt or grant additional security interests from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes, then the risks related to the Company s high level of debt could intensify. This high level of debt and royalty payment obligations could: 
 make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy obligations with respect to its outstanding debt; 
 require a substantial portion of the Company s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service and/or royalty payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 limit the Company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; 
 increase vulnerability to commodity price volatility, including increases in prices of commodities the Company purchases and decreases in prices of gold and silver that the Company sells, each as part of operations, general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 limit flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which the Company competes; 
 place the Company at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and 
 increase the Company s cost of borrowing. 
 Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, the Company s ability to meet payment obligations under the debt, and the price of the Company s common stock. The Sprott Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit the Company s ability to engage in activities that may be in the Company s long-term best interests. Failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of nearly all of the Company s debt. 
 If the Company defaults on its obligations to pay any of its indebtedness or otherwise defaults under the agreements governing the indebtedness, lenders could accelerate such debt and the Company may be subject to restrictions on the payment of other debt obligations or cause a cross-acceleration. 
 Any default under the agreements governing the Company s indebtedness that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of such indebtedness, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent the Company from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on other debt instruments. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on indebtedness and royalty payment obligations, or if otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in any agreement governing the indebtedness, the Company would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness and other indebtedness under the cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions of such agreements. In the event of such default: 
 20 

Table of Contents 

the lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to terminate any commitments thereunder, declare all the funds borrowed thereunder due and payable and, if not promptly paid, in the case of the Company s secured debt, institute foreclosure proceedings against company assets; and 
 even if the lenders or holders do not declare a default, they may be able to cause all of the Company s available cash to be used to repay indebtedness owed to them. 
 As a result of such default and any actions the lenders may take in response thereto, the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 The Company may not have sufficient cash or may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service outstanding indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy indebtedness obligations, which may not be successful. 
 The Company s ability to make scheduled payments on its debt, including pursuant to the Sprott Credit Agreement and Subordinated Notes, and royalty obligations or refinance debt obligations (if necessary) depends on its financial condition, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company s control, including the market prices of gold and silver. The Company may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow sufficient to permit it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Company s indebtedness and royalty obligations. 
 If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund the Company s debt service obligations and royalty obligations, it could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. The Company may be unable to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow the Company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Sprott Credit Agreement restricts the Company s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict the ability to raise debt to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may be unable to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service and royalty payment obligations then due. 
 The Company s inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy its debt and royalty obligations, or to refinance indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect the Company s financial position and results of operations and the ability to satisfy its obligations. 
 If the Company cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, it will be in default and the lenders under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement could foreclose against the assets securing its borrowings and the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 Land reclamation requirements for the Hycroft Mine may be burdensome and expensive and include requirements that the Company provide financial assurance supporting those requirements. 
 Land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on companies with mining operations to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents, treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards, and reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance landforms and vegetation. 
 To carry out reclamation obligations imposed on the Company in connection with its activities at the Hycroft Mine, the Company must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further development programs. The Company has established a provision for its reclamation obligations on the Hycroft Mine, as appropriate, but this provision may be inadequate. If required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, the Company s financial position could be adversely affected. 
 The Company is also required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved reclamation plans for the Hycroft Mine if the Company is unable to do so. Third party financial assurances may not be available to the Company or the Company may elect not to obtain it because of the high costs, associated collateral requirements may be too expensive, or it may be commercially impractical, which could materially adversely affect the Company s financial position.

Future litigation or similar legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and results of operations. 
 Lawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings may arise in the course of the Company s operations. The Company may also face heightened regulatory or other public scrutiny as a result of going public via a transaction with a special purpose acquisition company. These sorts of lawsuits or proceedings can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fines. In addition, lawsuits and other legal proceedings may be time-consuming and may require a commitment of management and personnel resources that will be diverted from the Company s normal business operations. Although the Company generally maintains insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of the Company s insurance policies. Moreover, the Company may be unable to continue to maintain its existing insurance policies at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits and other legal proceedings being uninsured. The Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance. 
 The Company is dependent upon information technology systems that are subject to disruption, damage, failure, and risks associated with implementation and integration. 
 The Company is dependent upon information technology systems to conduct its operations. The information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, extortion to prevent or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to operational downtimes, operational delays, extortion, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into its operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
 The two largest stockholders of the Company can exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of the Company s other stockholders. 
 As of March 27, 2023, 2176423 Ontario Limited, an entity affiliated with Eric Sprott Eric Sprott and American Multi-Cinema, Inc. AMC owned approximately 9 and 12 , respectively, of the Company s outstanding voting securities, respectively, and each have the right to acquire 23,408,240 additional shares, respectively, of common stock upon the exercise of warrants held by them. In addition, AMC has the right to receive an additional 61,189 shares of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock units granted to AMC for their Board of Directors representative. Because of their significant stockholdings, each of Eric Sprott and AMC could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise influence the business. This influence could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or entrenching management or the Board of Directors, which could conflict with the interests of other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s common stock. 
 Risks related to the Company s Common Stock and Warrants 
 The market prices and trading volume of shares of the Company s common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of the Company s common stock to incur substantial losses. 
 The market prices and trading volume of shares of the Company s common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers to incur substantial losses. For example, during 2022, the market price of the Company s common stock fluctuated from an intra-day low of 0.28 per share on March 2, 2022 to an intra-day high of 3.10 on March 29, 2022, and the last recorded sales price of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq on March 27, 2023 was 0.3852 per share. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, for example, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 78,900 to 386,186,700 shares. Within the month of March 2022, the market price of the Company s common stock fluctuated from an intra-day low of 0.28 on March 2, 2022 to an intra-day high of 3.10 on March 29, 2022. 
 The Company believes the historical volatility may reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to the Company s underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and it is unknown how long these dynamics will last. Under the circumstances investing in the Company s common stock may cause stockholders to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of their investment. 
 Extreme fluctuations in the market price of the Company s common stock has been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns the Company has experienced creates several risks for stockholders, including the following: 
 the market price of the Company s common stock has experienced and may experience in the future rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to the Company s financial performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties the Company continues to face; 
 factors in the public trading market for the Company s common stock include the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in the Company s securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on the Company s common stock and any related hedging and other trading factors; 
 the Company s market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to recent volatility, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to the Company s financial performance or prospects, purchasers of its common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuations; and 
 to the extent volatility in the Company s common stock is caused, as has widely been reported, by a short squeeze in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of its common stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses,stockholders purchase at inflated prices unrelated to the Company s financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated. 
 The market price of the Company s shares of common stock and publicly-traded warrants may fluctuate widely. 
 The trading price of the Company s common stock and warrants listed for trading may fluctuate substantially and may be lower than their current prices. The market prices and trading volume of shares of the Company s common stock have experienced, and may experience in the future, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of the Company s common stock to incur substantial losses. The Company may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in its stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting the Company. Accordingly, the market price of shares of the Company s common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in the Company s business. Overall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, that could negatively affect the market price of the Company s common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Company s common stock, including: 
 publication of research reports by analysts or others about the Company or the precious metals market, which may be unfavorable, inaccurate, inconsistent or not disseminated on a regular basis; 
 changes in market interest rates that may cause purchasers of shares of the Company s common stock to demand a different yield; 
 changes in market valuations of similar companies; 
 market reaction to any additional equity, debt or other securities that the Company may issue in the future, and which may or may not dilute the holdings of existing stockholders; 
 actual or anticipated variations in the Company s annual or quarterly results of operations; 
 additions or departures of key personnel or Board of Directors members; 
 actions by institutional or significant stockholders; 
 short interest in the Company s stock and the market response to such short interest; 
 the dramatic increase in the number of individual holders of the Company s stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing; 
 23 

Table of Contents 

speculation in the press or investment community about the Company or industry; 
 strategic actions by the Company or its competitors, such as acquisitions or other investments; 
 the ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting the Company or industry; 
 investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect the Company; and 
 general market, economic and political conditions, such reductions in precious metals prices, increases in fuel and other commodity prices used in business operations, currency fluctuations, and acts of war or terrorism. 
 In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies securities, securities class action litigations have often been instituted against these companies. Litigation of this type, if instituted against the Company, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require the Company to make significant payments. 
 You may experience dilution as a result of future equity offerings. 
 On March 14, 2022, the Company entered into definitive agreements to issue 46,816,480 units in a private placement, with each unit consisting of one share of the Company s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. In addition, the Company conducted an at-the-market registered public offering in which it sold 89,553,584 additional shares of common stock. The private placement and the at-the-market registered public offering substantially increased the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In the future, the Company may issue additional shares of common stock to raise cash to bolster the Company s liquidity, to pay indebtedness, for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. The Company may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. The Company may also acquire interests in other companies or other assets by using a combination of cash and shares of common stock or using only shares of common stock. The Company may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the prices per share paid by stockholders, and stockholders purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which the Company sells additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the prices per share paid by stockholders. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of existing stockholders or reduce the market price of the Company s common stock, or both. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of shares of the Company s common stock. Further, sales of substantial amounts of the Company s common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of the Company s common stock. 
 A short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of the Company s common stock that largely exceeds supply and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a potential short squeeze have led to, may be currently leading to, and could again lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of the Company s common stock. 
 Stockholders may purchase shares of the Company s common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of the Company s common stock. Speculation on the price of the Company s common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of common stock available for purchase on the open market, stockholders with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock for delivery to lenders of the Company s common stock. Those repurchases may, in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of the Company s common stock until additional shares are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a short squeeze have led to, and could again lead to volatile price movements in shares of the Company s common stock that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the Company s financial performance or prospects and, once stockholders purchase the shares of the Company s common stock necessary to cover their short positions, or if investors no longer believe a short squeeze is viable, the price of the Company s common stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of the Company s common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment. T he Company cautions stockholders against investing in the Company s common stock, unless stockholders are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of their investment.

There can be no assurance that the Company s proposed reverse stock split will increase the price of the Company s common stock. 
 At the annual meeting of the Company s stockholders to be held on May 24, 2023, the Company will ask stockholders to approve (among other proposals) a proposal to approve the amendment of the Company s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ), to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of no less than 1-for-10 and no more than 1-for-25, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board, and with such action to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Board of Directors (the Reverse Stock Split ). 
 The Company expects that the Reverse Stock Split will increase the per share trading price of the Company s common stock. However, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split on the per share trading price of the Company s common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of reverse stock splits for other companies is varied. It is possible that the per share trading price of the common stock after the Reverse Stock Split will not increase in the same proportion as the reduction in the number of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock following the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, although the Company believes the Reverse Stock Split may enhance the marketability of the Company s common stock to certain potential investors, there can be no assurance that, if implemented, the Company s common stock will be more attractive to investors. Even if the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, the per share trading price of the Company s common stock may decrease due to factors unrelated to the Reverse Stock Split, including the Company s future performance. If the Reverse Stock Split is consummated and the per share trading price of the common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Despite approval of the Reverse Stock Split by the Company s stockholders and the implementation thereof by the Board of Directors, there is no assurance that the price of the Company s common stock would be, or remain, following the Reverse Stock Split at a level high enough to enable us the Company to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or to attract capital investment in the Company. 
 The proposed Reverse Stock Split may decrease the liquidity of the Company s common stock and result in higher transaction costs . 
 The liquidity of the Company s common stock may be negatively impacted by the Reverse Stock Split, given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split, particularly if the per share trading price does not increase as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, if the Reverse Stock Split is implemented, it may increase the number of stockholders who own odd lots of fewer than 100 shares of common stock. Brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally higher than the costs of transactions of more than 100 shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Reverse Stock Split may not result in increasing the marketability of the Company s common stock. 
 Information available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate. 
 The Company has received, and may in the future receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by the Company s directors, officers or employees. Investors should read carefully, evaluate and rely only on the information contained in documents filed by the Company with the SEC in determining whether to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate and could materially impact the trading price of the Company s common stock which could cause stockholders to incur losses on their investments. 
 Increases in market interest rates may cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for the Company s common stock, which could result in a decline in the Company s stock price. 
 One of the factors that may influence the price of the Company s common stock is the return on the Company s common stock (i.e., the amount of distributions as a percentage of the price of the Company s common stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of the Company s common stock to expect a return, which the Company may be unable or choose not to provide. Further, higher interest rates would likely increase the Company s borrowing costs and potentially decrease the cash available. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Company s common stock to decline.

Volatility in the price of the Company s common stock may subject it to securities litigation. 
 As discussed above, historically, the market for the Company s common stock has been characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and the Company expects that its share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. The Company may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources. 
 The Company does not anticipate paying common stock dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 The Company currently plans to invest all available funds and future cash flows, if any, in the development and growth of its business. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently has no plans to do so. The Company s debt agreements contain provisions that restrict its ability to pay dividends. As a result, a rise in the market price of the Company s common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, is the only source of potential gain for the foreseeable future and stockholders should not rely on an investment in the Company s common stock for dividend income. 
 Future offerings of debt, which would be senior to the Company s common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities, which may be senior to its common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could adversely affect the market price of its common stock. 
 In the future, the Company may attempt to increase capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including convertible or non-convertible senior or subordinated notes, convertible or non-convertible preferred stock, medium-term notes and trust preferred securities. Upon liquidation, holders of the Company s debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of common stock. In addition, any preferred stock the Company may issue could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on distribution payments that could limit the Company s ability to make a distribution to the holders of its common stock. Since the Company s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of future offerings. Thus, stockholders bear the risk of future offerings reducing the market price of the Company s common stock. 
 The Company received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Company s common stock and warrants could be delisted from trading unless the common stock price trades above 1.00 per share. 
 As previously disclosed, on October 3, 2022, the Company received notice (the Notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock, which continues to trade at this time on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol HYMC. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days, or until April 3, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180-calendar day period. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by April 3, 2023, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares 1 million) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price, and provide written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split. The Company s Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation that would effect a reverse stock split. The amendment must be approved by stockholders. The Company expects to submit the amendment to stockholders at its annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 24, 2023. 
 If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In that event, the Company may appeal such delisting determination to a hearings panel. Further, if the Company does regain compliance, the Company cannot provide assurance that the trading price of its common stock will not fall below 1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days and that it will not receive another notice that it was not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or that it will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, even if it maintains compliance with the other listing requirements.

There is no guarantee that the Company s outstanding warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless . 
 The Company s outstanding warrants have a strike price that is higher than the last recorded sales price of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq on March 27, 2023. Specifically, the Company has 34,289,898 warrants outstanding that expire on May 29, 2025 that entitle holders to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 11.50, 9,583,334 warrants outstanding that expire on October 6, 2025 that entitle holders to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 10.50 per share and 46,816,480 warrants outstanding that expire on March 15, 2027 that entitle holders to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 1 .068 per share. 
 Certain of the Company s warrants are being accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which could increase the volatility in the Company s net income (loss) and may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company s common stock. 
 In addition to other securities, warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock were issued in a private placement to the SPAC sponsor and underwriter (the 5-Year Private Warrants in the aggregate amount of 7,740,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share on May 29, 2020, and concurrently with the closing of the Recapitalization Transaction, as part of a forward purchase unit offering, the Company issued an additional 2,500,000 5-Year Private Warrants to the SPAC sponsor at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. 
 The Company determined that the 5-Year Private Warrants are a liability required to be marked-to-market with the non-cash fair value adjustments recorded in earnings at each reporting period. Changes in the trading price of the Company s common stock and the fair value of the 5-Year Private Warrants could result in significant volatility in the warrant liability and net income (loss) in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Once the 5-Year Private Warrants are sold to a third-party, they are classified as public warrants and are no longer marked-to-market. 
 Anti-takeover provisions contained in the Company s charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
 The Company s charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. The Company is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make it more difficult to remove management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for the Company s securities. These provisions include: 
 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 
 the right of the Company s Board of Directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company s Board of Directors; 
 a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of the Company s Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 
 the ability of the Company s Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 
 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, the directors and officers; and 
 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Company s Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company. 
 The Company is an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the applicable reduced disclosure requirements may make the Company s common stock less attractive to stockholders. 
 The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act ). As such, the Company elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on- 
 27 

Table of Contents 

frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, the Company s stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 12, 2023, the fifth anniversary of the IPO, (b) in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of its common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of the Company s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 The Company is also a smaller reporting company , and will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that the Company s voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is 250 million or more measured on the last business day of the second fiscal quarter, or the Company s annual revenues are 100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year and the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is 700 million or more measured on the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited consolidated financial statements. The Company s stockholders may find its common stock less attractive as a result of the status as an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company and the Company s reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements afforded to these companies.

Hycroft Technical Report Summary 
 On March 28 2023, the Company, along with its third-party consultants, completed and filed the 2023 Hycroft TRS prepared in accordance with the Modernization Rules. The 2023 Hycroft TRS provides an initial assessment of the mineral resource estimate utilizing a milling and POX process for sulfide mineralization and heap leaching process for oxide and transition mineralization. As a result of additional information, including historical assay certificates and drilling results obtained during 2022 and included in the 2023 Hycroft TRS, the 2023 Hycroft TRS supersedes and replaces the 2022 Hycroft TRS. Accordingly, the 2022 Hycroft TRS should no longer be relied upon. In addition, see the sections entitled Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Mineral Resources , Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements , and Risk Factors when reviewing the information set forth in this Section. 
 The information that follows relating to the Hycroft Mine is derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from, the 2023 Hycroft TRS. Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are not fully described herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the 2023 Hycroft TRS, incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 96.1 to this 2022 Form 10-K and made a part hereof. 
 During 2022, the Company, together with its consultants, continued to advance work on the mill and POX process to treat the Hycroft sulfide mineral resource. The mill and POX process remains the focus of ongoing work, as it generates higher gold and silver recoveries in sulfide bearing ores. Recoveries become a critical factor in developing and optimizing the mineral economics of the deposit. POX recoveries will be further verified with ore-specific variability testing. As that work progressed in 2022, the Company continued to identify additional opportunities that may yield significant economic benefits to the project. 
 Upon furnishing the 2023 Hycroft TRS, the Hycroft Mine had measured and indicated mineral resources of 10.6 million ounces of gold and 360.7 million ounces of silver and inferred mineral resources of 3.4 million ounces of gold and 96.1 million ounces of silver, which are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores. 
 Overview and Highlights 
 The 2023 Hycroft TRS summarizes the results of an initial assessment and supports the disclosure of mineral resources at the Hycroft Mine utilizing a milling and POX process for sulfide mineralization and heap leaching process for oxide and transition mineralization. The work has been prepared at the request of the Company and completed by third-party consultants including Ausenco, IMC, and WestLand. Employees of IMC and Ausenco who have worked on and approved this mineral resource estimate are Qualified Persons as defined under the Modernization Rules. 
 After evaluating the information obtained, and carefully considering the numerous and significant opportunities developed during the assessment process that warrant follow-up analysis and work, coupled with the highly inflationary environment for equipment and cost inputs, the Company filed the 2023 Hycroft TRS. The 2023 Hycroft TRS supersedes all previous technical studies. The Company will continue to build on the work to date and investigate opportunities identified through progressing the technical and data analyses leading up to the 2023 Hycroft TRS and will provide an updated technical report at an appropriate time. 
 The mineral resource is based upon information provided by the Company which has been checked and validated wherever possible by IMC. The calculations and interpretations presented here are the work of IMC, who takes responsibility for the published mineral resource. 
 Hycroft Mine 
 For a detailed discussion of the Hycroft Mine s operating and production data, see Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Hycroft Mine . 
 The Hycroft Mine and related facilities are located approximately 54 miles northwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. Winnemucca, a city with a population of approximately 8,431 (2020 Census data), is a commercial community on Interstate 80, 164 miles northeast of Reno. The mine property straddles Townships 34, 35, 351 2 and 36 North and Ranges 28, 29 and 30 East (MDB M) with an approximate latitude 40 52 north and longitude 118 41 west.

Additionally, the following map shows the current property and facilities layout. 
 
 The town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a municipal airport. Access to the Hycroft Mine from Winnemucca is by Jungo Road, formerly designated as State Route 49, a good-quality, unpaved road, and a short access road to the main entrance of the mine. Well-maintained mine and exploration roads provide access throughout the property. Access is also possible from Imlay, Gerlach and Lovelock by unpaved roads intersecting Interstate 80 and Nevada State Route 447. The majority of the Hycroft Mine s employees live in the Winnemucca area. The site receives electrical power provided by NV Energy from the northwestern Nevada power grid. Initial surveys indicate that the town of Winnemucca has the required infrastructure (shopping, emergency services, schools, etc.) to support the maximum workforce and dependents. The Hycroft Mine currently has water rights which are believed adequate to support potential future operations. The Hycroft Mine is situated on the eastern edge of the Black Rock Desert and on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains between Winnemucca and Gerlach, Nevada. There are no streams, rivers or major lakes in the general area. Elevations in the Hycroft Mine area range between 4,500 and 5,500 feet above sea level. 
 The climate of the region is arid, with precipitation averaging 7.7 inches per year. Average temperatures during the summer range from 50 F to 90 F and average winter temperatures range from 20 F to 40 F.

The Hycroft Mine consists of 30 private parcels with patented claims that comprise approximately 1,787 acres, and 3,247 unpatented lode and placer mining claims that encompass approximately 62,298 acres. The combined patented and unpatented claims comprise approximately 64,000 acres. The Hycroft Mine s patented claims occupy private lands and its unpatented claims occupy public lands, administered by the BLM. These claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government and the State of Nevada. To maintain the patented claims in good standing, we must pay the annual property tax payments to the county in which the claims are held. To maintain the unpatented claims in good standing, we must file a notice of intent to maintain the claims within the county and pay the annual mineral claim filing fees to the BLM. Such filing fees amounted to 0.6 million in 2022. As long as we file the annual notice and pay the claim filing fees, there is no expiration date for our unpatented claims. 
 A portion of the Hycroft Mine is subject to a mining lease requiring us to pay 4 net profit royalty to the owner of certain patented and unpatented mining claims, subject to a maximum of 7.6 million, of which 3.3 million has been satisfied and 4.3 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022. There is no expiration date on the net profit royalty. 
 The Hycroft Mine is also subject to the Sprott Royalty Agreement and that requires us to pay a perpetual royalty equal to 1.5 of the Net Smelter Returns, as such term is defined in such agreement, from the Hycroft Mine. There is no expiration and no limit on the amount that can be paid on the Sprott Royalty Agreement. 
 The Hycroft Mine was formerly known as the Crofoot-Lewis open pit mine, which was a small heap leaching operation that commenced in 1983. Vista Gold Corp., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Yukon Territory Vista ), acquired the Crofoot-Lewis claims and mine in 1987 and 1988. During this first operating period the mine produced over 1.0 million ounces of gold and 2.5 million ounces of silver. The mine production continued until it was placed on a care and maintenance program in December 1998 due to low gold prices. Hycroft Mining Corporation HMC acquired the Hycroft Mine in 2007 pursuant to an arrangement agreement where Vista transferred its Nevada mining properties to HMC s predecessor. HMC restarted the Hycroft Mine in 2008 and suspended mining operations on July 8, 2015. During 2016, HMC was actively processing and producing gold from the ore within the heap leach pads. On January 1, 2017, Hycroft Mining Corporation HMC or Seller went into a care and maintenance mode when it stopped adding lime to the leach pads and continued to operate in a care and maintenance mode throughout 2017 and 2018. Prior to restarting operations, production of gold and silver was a byproduct of HMC s maintenance activities on the Hycroft Mine. In December 2018 HMC began restart activities, including the rehabilitation of the crushing facility and construction of a new leach pad, with active mining operations beginning in the second quarter of 2019 with six haul trucks, two hydraulic shovels and one wheel loader. Initial gold and silver production occurred in August 2019 and continued until active mining operations were ceased at the Hycroft Mine in November 2021. 
 On site facilities include an administration building, mobile maintenance shop, light vehicle maintenance shop, warehouse, five leach pads, crushing system, two Merrill-Crowe process plants and a refinery. The components for a second refinery are on-site and will be constructed as part of the expansion of mining activities. The crushing system was refurbished as part of the restart activities and all other facilities are operational with the exception of the North Merrill-Crowe plant, which will be rehabilitated and brought online when required. The gross carrying value of plant and equipment associated with the Hycroft Mine as of December 31, 2022, was 86.6 million. 
 Geology and Mineralization 
 The Hycroft Mine is located on the western flank of the Kamma Mountains. The deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the Tertiary Kamma Mountain volcanics. The volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs, flows and coarse volcanoclastic rocks. Fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia. The Central Fault and East Fault control the distribution of mineralization. A post-mineral range-front fault separates the ore-body from the adjacent Pleistocene Lahontan Lake sediments in the Black Rock Desert. The geological events have created a physical setting ideally suited to the open-pit, heap-leach mining operation at the Hycroft Mine. The heap leach method is widely used in the southwestern United States and allows the economical treatment of oxidized low-grade ore deposits in large volumes. The Company is currently contemplating a milling and POX process that is commonly used worldwide to treat refractory sulfide ores. 
 The deposit is typically broken into six major zones based on geology, mineralization, and alteration. These zones include Brimstone, Vortex, Central, Bay, Boneyard, and Camel. Breaks between the zones are major faults. 
 Mineralization at the Hycroft Mine has been deposited through multiple phases. An early silica sulfide flooding event deposited relatively low-grade gold and silver mineralization generally along bedding. This mineralization is crosscut by later, steeply dipping quartz alunite veins. Late-stage silver bearing veins are found in the Vortex zone and at depth in the Central 
 32 

Table of Contents 

area. Late to present supergene oxidation along faults has liberated precious metals from sulfide mineralization and further enriched gold and silver mineralization, along water table levels. 
 The known gold mineralization extends for a distance of three miles in a north-south direction by 1.5 miles in an east-west direction. Mineralization extends to a depth of less than 330 feet in the outcropping to near-outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over 2,500 feet in the Vortex deposit in the east. 
 Drilling 
 The Hycroft Mine mineral resource model includes data from 1981 t o 2022 and includes 5,601 holes, representing 2,588,826 feet of drilling, of which 171 holes were added during 2021 and 2022. At this time, there are 5,532 drill holes in the resource model area which includes holes drilled to define stockpiles. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

Drill hole collar locations are shown in the figure below. 
 
 Consistent with HMC s suspension of mining operations and conducting only care and maintenance activities on the Hycroft Mine, during 2017 and through December 2018, only drilling to obtain ore for metallurgical testing purposes was conducted. In December 2018, HMC began confirmation drilling of certain sulfide ore stockpiles that we planned to mine. 
 Any expansion of the Hycroft Mine necessary to exploit any additional mineral resources that may be established through our exploration drilling program beyond the mineral resources in the 2023 Hycroft TRS, will require us to obtain all permits, approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in Nevada.

Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources 
 Our mineral resource estimates are calculated in accordance with the Modernization Rules. Measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral resources disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries. The estimates of mineral resources may be materially affected if mining, metallurgical, or infrastructure factors change from those currently anticipated at the Hycroft Mine. Estimates of inferred mineral resources have significant geological uncertainty and it should not be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will be converted to the measured or indicated categories. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not meet the threshold for reserve modifying factors, such as estimated economic viability, that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves. The Hycroft Mine contains a large precious metals deposit, based on measured and indicated mineral resource size. The mineral resource estimates were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, IMC, as set forth in the 2023 Hycroft TRS. 
 The following description of the Hycroft Mine s measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the 2023 Hycroft TRS, incorporated by reference as Exhibit 96.1 to this 2022 Form 10-K and made a part hereof.

 Notes: 
 Cutoffs grades were determined by income process cost = NPR = NSR Process Opex. Cutoff grade is the minimum grade required for a mineral to be economically mined and processed to retrieve the metal for commercial sale. The cutoff grade for Hycroft is determined by assessing each mine block for gold and silver content and then applying a cost for extraction of these metals from that block by employing commercial mining practices and using the crushing, grinding, flotation, pressure oxidation and cyanide leaching circuit for oxidized flotation concentrate process to create a gold/silver dor bar. Process costs include the environmental practices for placing waste and tailing material in properly designed facilities that can be remediated in the future. 
 Numbers in the table have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate and may not sum due to rounding. 
 Mineral resources are contained within a computer-generated optimized pit. Total material in that pit is 3.631 billion tons. 
 All units are imperial. Ktons refers to 1,000 short tons of 2,000 lbs. Gold and silver grades are in troy ounces/short ton.

 Notes: 
 Cutoffs grades were determined by income process cost = NPR = NSR Process Opex. Cutoff grade is the minimum grade required for a mineral to be economically mined and processed to retrieve the metal for commercial sale. The cutoff grade for Hycroft is determined by assessing each mine block for gold and silver content and then applying a cost for extraction of these metals from that block by employing commercial mining practices and using the crushing, grinding, flotation, pressure oxidation and cyanide leaching circuit for oxidized flotation concentrate process to create a gold/silver dor bar. Process costs include the environmental practices for placing waste and tailing material in properly designed facilities that can be remediated in the future. 
 Numbers in the table have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate and may not sum due to rounding. 
 Mineral resources are contained within a computer-generated optimized pit. Total material in that pit is 3.516 billion tons. 
 All units are imperial. Ktons refers to 1,000 short tons of 2,000 lbs. Gold and silver grades are in troy ounces/short ton. 
 During 2022, the Company and IMC spent significant effort toward the verification of the drill hole database. That work included: 
 Detailed comparison of certificates of assay versus the assay data base which resulted in substantial update and correction to the data base. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Analysis of the QAQC data used by the Company and previous owners from 2005 to 2022. This work was completed in two stages representing different time periods. 
 Analysis of Diamond Drilling DDH versus Reverse Circulation RC with the post 2005 drilling to confirm that the two methods can be comingled and utilized for the estimation of mineral resources. 
 Comparison of the pre-2005 drilling versus post-2005 drilling to verify the application of the older data. The pre-2005 data has no QAQC information that can be used to verify its reliability. 
 Based on this work, changes were made to the drill hole database that were included in the estimate of mineral resources reported in the 2023 Hycroft TRS. As a result of the changes discussed below, the Hycroft Mine s measured and indicated gold mineral resources increased by 0.9 million ounces and its measured and indicated silver mineral resources decreased by 85.3 million ounces. In addition, the Hycroft Mine s inferred gold mineral resources decreased by 1.7 million ounces and its silver inferred mineral resources decreased by 54.3 million ounces. 
 The reasons for the change in mineral resources are as follows: 
 Additional drilling assay results from 2021 and the assay results received through December 9, 2022 have been added to the database. This data came from 171 holes containing 23,804 gold fire assays and 23,780 silver fire assays. 
 The February 2022 resource statement reflected downward adjustments for reported bias in grade estimation from pre-2000 gold fire assay values. Detailed review of historical assay certificates confirmed that the database used to develop the mineral resource corresponds to the original assay certificates, therefore the downward adjustment was removed. 
 Approximately 165,000 silver fire assay samples previously included in the database as no assay results were found to have trace level assay values. As a result, the no assay sample values were replaced with the lower trace sample values. Trace assay sample values are less than the grade of economic mineralization. No assay sample values allow the model to estimate the mineralization in the area between two drill holes with known mineralization values. Trace assay values are approximately one-half the detection limit of the calibrated laboratory instrument used in assessing assay samples.) 
 Detailed analysis of the earliest drilling at Hycroft from 1982 to 1987 indicated that the assays were high biased. As a result, the historical assays from this period have been adjusted downward and taking a conservative approach, the resource from this time period has been classified as inferred material only. 
 Economic changes include a reduction of process costs by 3 due to more detailed analysis and an increase of metal prices from 1800/oz gold and 23.00/oz silver to 1,900/oz gold and 24.50/oz silver. 
 Minor changes to block model estimation methods are also incorporated. 
 Mineral resources were developed based on a conventional computer-based block model of the deposit and the application of open pit optimization software to determine the mineralization with reasonable expectation of economic extraction. Each block was evaluated to determine which process provides the best net return after operating cost. The two processes identified were: 
 Run-of-Mine ROM cyanide heap leaching of oxide ore; and 
 milling, flotation and acid pressure oxidation of sulfide and transitional ores followed by cyanide leach and processing in a Merrill-Crowe facility. 
 Other assumptions used to develop measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources were: 
 assumed prices for gold of 1,900 per ounce and for silver of 24.50 per ounce; 
 recoveries for gold and silver were estimated by process type: 
 milling, flotation and acid pressure oxidation was 76 overall of the fire assays for gold and 76 for fire assays for silver; and 
 ROM heap leaching was 75 for cyanide soluble gold and 12.2 for fire assay silver; 
 base mining cost of 1.45 per ton with an additional incremental 0.016/ton applied to each bench below the 4660 level; 
 variable ore processing costs based on geometallurgical domains and sulfur content; and 
 general and administrative cost 0.44 per ton. 
 See Table 11-14 in Section 11 of the 2023 Hycroft TRS for a more detailed presentation of the economic parameters for mineral resource estimation.

 Internal Controls and Material Assumptions 
 IMC developed and updated the block model for the 2023 Hycroft TRS. Below is the summary of the work and checks they used to develop the block model. 
 The Hycroft Mine resource model includes data from 1981 to 2022 and includes 5,601 holes, representing 2,588,826 feet of drilling. The drill hole collar locations are shown in the 2023 Hycroft TRS and later in this text. At this time, there are 5,323 drill holes in the resource model area of which 188 have been drilled to define stockpiles or the Crofoot leach pad. 
 In addition to drilling activity, the Company has also conducted geophysical surveys, soil and rock chip sampling programs, field mapping, historical data compilation, and regional reconnaissance at the Hycroft Mine site. These efforts are designed to improve the understanding of the known mineralization, as well as provide data for further exploration of the greater property position. 
 A soil sampling grid was conducted over the Vortex and Brimstone areas historically (1,797 samples) and was extended approximately 5,200 feet north and 29,600 feet south of the mine in 2011-2012 (1,834 samples). The soil sampling program was conducted primarily along the East Fault exposure, which is a primary ore-controlling feature at Vortex and Brimstone. Soil samples are taken on an evenly spaced grid, and screened for coarse material and wind-blown material, resulting in a fraction between 2 mm and 180 m being prepped for analysis. These samples are considered representative of local soil geochemistry and are used to guide the regional exploration effort. 
 Rock chip sampling has been conducted both historically in the active mine area, and on a regional basis (2008 present). A database of 2,416 samples has been compiled, covering the greater land position. Au values range from 0 to 0.372 ppm, while Ag values range from 0 to 71.8 ppm. Rock chip samples have been taken on most outcrops, with a focus on alteration and potential mineralization. These samples are used as a guide to exploration and are point samples only. 
 The land position has been surveyed with both gravity and induced polarity IP geophysical techniques by Hycroft. The current ground-based gravity survey covers approximately 130 square miles, centered on the mine site. Gravity indicates several structural features and density changes. Gravity has also defined the basin edge to the west, approximately 4 miles west of the Brimstone Pit. 
 Ground IP surveys were run over the mine site and Vortex in 2007 and extended outward in 2011 to cover approximately 24 square miles. The survey results focus on chargeability anomalies, that potentially identify sulfide material (> approximately 1.5 at depth, and resistivity anomalies, that potentially identify silicification at depth. 
 In 2022 a hyperspectral imaging flyover of the Hycroft property was conducted by SpecTIR Advanced Hyperspectral Solutions. Both Longwave Infrared LWIR and Shortwave Infrared SWIR imaging was collected with the intent of helping identify key minerals on the surface to focus reconnaissance mapping and soils programs. 
 Field mapping was historically carried out in all active mine areas. Mapping focuses on structure, bedding, joints, lithology, and alteration. The near mine data is incorporated into the three-dimensional geology model, while the regional work is focused on defining exploration targets for future drilling. A regional geology map covering the land position was compiled in 2012. 
 The drill hole database was assembled over many years by multiple companies using at least four different drill methods. 
 There are stockpiles and historical leach pads at the Hycroft Mine that are within the block model area. Many of those have been drilled after the original excavation of hard rock by sonic or rotary methods. The stockpile holes have been used to estimate the stockpile and leach pad areas, they have not been used to estimate in-situ rock. In total, the Hycroft Mine database contains 5,601 drill holes with 500,214 sample intervals. Within the area of the block model, there are 5,532 drill holes with 490,452 drill intervals amounting to 2,537,335 feet of drilling. 
 The block model was verified by several methods before being used to determine mineral resource, including: 
 detailed Visual Checks of Drilling versus Block Estimates; 
 swath Plots; and 
 IMC Smear Check. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

IMC completed visual checks on plan and section for all of the estimated variables in the model. In addition to IMC visual checks, the Hycroft engineering and geology team on site also reviewed the model and assisted IMC with identifying and correcting coding issues prior to finalizing the block model. 
 Swath plots are a practice now common among resource modelers to provide a visual indication if the block model follows the grade trends indicated by the supporting data and if there is any observable local bias in the block grade estimation. 
 Quality assurance and quality control methods utilized in the 2023 Hycroft TRS included the use of a test by IMC to understand the amount of grade smoothing within the block model and to confirm that the model grades are not high biased, referred to internally as the smear check. 
 The procedure utilized by IMC was as follows: 
 a range of cutoff grades were selected for the check process, generally bracketing the potential planning cutoff grades; 
 for each cutoff grade being tested, the blocks above cutoff were identified; 
 all composites contained within those blocks were identified; 
 the average grade of the composites and blocks were tabulated; and 
 the percentage of the contained composites less than cutoff were calculated. 
 Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding Mineral Resources. The mineral resource estimates included herein or incorporated by reference herein, including in the 2023 Hycroft TRS, have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules as set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K which became widely applicable on January 1, 2021. These disclosures differ in material respects from the prior requirements set forth in Industry Guide 7, including in that mineral resource information was not permitted and mineral resources have been calculated in accordance with the provision of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. These standards differ significantly from the disclosure requirements of Industry Guide 7 in that mineral resource information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies that have not implemented the Modernization Rules promulgated by the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization, such are mineral resources, may not be classified as a mineral reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produce or extracted at the time of the reserve determination. The term economically, as was used in the SEC s Industry Guide 7 definition of mineral reserves, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term legally as used in the SEC s Industry Guide 7 definition of mineral reserves, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, we must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with our current mine plans. The terms Mineral Resource , Measured Mineral Resource , Indicated Mineral Resource and Inferred Mineral Resource are defined and used in accordance with the Modernization Rules. You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits (including mineral resources) in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. You are further cautioned that, except for any portion of mineral resources, as applicable, classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence as to whether they can be economically or legally mined. Under the Modernization Rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will be upgraded to mineral reserves.

 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 The Company believes the miner is the most important thing to come out of a mine and it supports that belief through its philosophy of continuous improvement. The Company s mandated mine safety and health programs include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation, and program auditing. These programs are a focus for the Company s leadership and top management and are essential at all levels to ensure that its employees, contractors, and visitors operate safely. The Company s goal for these programs is to have zero workplace injuries and occupational illnesses and it will focus on continuous improvement of its programs and practices to achieve this goal and is implementing programs and practices to align its safety culture with that goal. 
 One of the metrics the Company uses to measure its safety performance is the industry standard TRIFR. The Hycroft Mine s TRIFR per 200,000 man-hours worked (including contractors) was 0.00 at the end of 2022, as compared to 0.64 at the end of 2021 and the mining industry average of approximately 2.02 for 2022. In 2022, the Company recruited new leadership from strong safety cultures in the mining industry that helped it successfully rebuild the Hycroft Mine safety culture utilizing elements in advanced safety practices and management making them the cornerstone for its safety success. The Company emphasizes safety as a cornerstone of its corporate culture and continues with the practices, and people to elevate its safety performance in all site activities. 
 The operation of the Hycroft Mine is subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act. MSHA inspects the Hycroft Mine on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years. 
 The information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this 2022 Form 10-K.

Introduction to the Company 
 We are a gold and silver development company that owns the Hycroft Mine in the prolific mining region of Northern Nevada. We are focused on exploring the Hycroft Mine s claims comprising approximately 64,085 acres and developing the Hycroft Mine in a safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective manner. Gold and silver sales represent 100 of our Revenues and the market prices of gold and silver significantly impact our financial position, operating results, and cash flows. We ceased mining activities in November 2021, and as of December 31, 2022 we completed processing of gold and silver ore previously placed on leach pads. We do not expect to generate revenues from gold and silver sales until after developing the Hycroft Mine and recommencing mining operations. 
 
 Health and Safety 
 We believe that safety is a core value and we support that belief through our philosophy of safe work performance. Our mandatory mine safety and health programs include employee engagement and ownership of safety performance, accountability, employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation, and program auditing. This integrated approach is essential to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors operate safely. 
 During the year ended 2022, we reported no lost time accidents. The Hycroft Mine s TRIFR for the trailing twelve months, which includes other reportable incidents, is one of the metrics we use to assess safety performance, and it is well below industry averages and significantly below historical levels experienced at the Hycroft Mine. During the year ended 2022, we continued our critical focus on safety, including allocating additional personnel, resources, workforce time, and communications to mine safety. These actions contributed to a reduction in our TRIFR to Nil (0.00) at December 31, 2022, compared with approximately 0.64 at December 31, 2021, a reduction of 100 . We plan to advance our safety performance through continuous improvement programs and efforts to keep our workforce, contractors, and visitors safe. 
 
 For health and safety actions specific to COVID-19, see the Recent Developments section below. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued processing gold and silver from ore previously placed on the leach pads and, in August 2022, determined that it was no longer economic to continue to apply cyanide solution to the leach pads. As a result, we completed processing of gold and silver ore as of December 31, 2022. When the operation was re-started in 2019, mining oxide and transition ore allowed the Company to pre-strip overburden with some revenue offset to gain access to commercial scale sulfide mineralization. With the anticipated change to a milling operation, there is ample time to align the remaining pre-stripping with the start-up of commercial scale sulfide operations. We believe that this action conserves cash and focuses the Company s time and resources on targeted higher-grade exploration opportunities and technical studies for processing the Company s sulfide ore. The 2021 drill program concluded in the first quarter of 2022, and metallurgical analysis and variability test work is expected to continue through the second quarter of 2023. The 2022-2023 exploration program involving reverse circulation RC and core drilling began in the third quarter of 2022 and the Company completed Phase 1 in December 2022. 
 Following a review of past and recent test work and based on the currently contemplated designs and operating parameters of the alternative sulfide processing methods being studied and milling with atmospheric alkaline oxidation or POX, the Company, working closely with its industry leading technical consultants, completed pit optimization runs and trade-off analyses comparing the alternative processes which reflected that a POX process has significantly better economics than other processes studied. The POX process included in the 2023 Hycroft TRS is a conventional crushing, grinding, and flotation circuit that generates a concentrate to be fed to an autoclave facility commonly used for refractory gold ores in this region. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Project Update 
 2022-2023 Exploration Drill Program 
 In July 2022, the Company launched its 2022-2023 exploration drill program which is the largest exploration program at the Hycroft Mine in nearly a decade and comprises approximately 30,000 meters of RC drilling and 7,500 meters of core drilling. The overall focus of the 2022-2023 exploration drill program is to improve the understanding of the higher-grade intercepts identified during the 2021 drill program, better understand the mineralization controls, test exploration targets outside

the currently known deposits, and develop opportunities to mine higher-grade ore early in the mine plan enhancing the project s economics. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed Phase 1 of the 2022-2023 exploration drill program. The objectives of Phase 1 were: 
 Drilling within the current known resource, to establish continuity between higher-grade zones identified in 2021; 
 Converting mineralization previously classified as waste in the Camel and Central zones into ore grade mineralization; 
 Upgrading mineralization previously classified as inferred into measured and indicated in the Camel and Central zones; 
 Expanding mineralization to the east at least 150 meters beyond the known resource boundary opening a new target area for near-mine exploration; and 
 Establishing that the high-grade silver deposit, Vortex, continues to deliver high-grade silver mineralization over significant intercepts. 
 Approximately 25,000 meters of RC drilling and 4,000 meters of core drilling was completed during Phase 1 of the 2022-2023 exploration drill program. 
 Finalized Initial Assessment Technical Report 
 The Company, along with its third-party consultants, completed and filed the 2023 Hycroft TRS with an effective date of March 27, 2023. The 2023 Hycroft TRS included a mineral resource estimate for the Hycroft Mine. The 2023 Hycroft TRS included measured and indicated mineral resources of 10.6 million ounces of gold and 360.7 million ounces of silver (15.2 million gold equivalent ounces) and inferred mineral resources of 3.4 million ounces of gold and 96.1 million ounces of silver (4.6 million gold equivalent ounces), which are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores. 
 For this study, IMC developed the Hycroft Mine resource block model which includes 1981 to 2022 data generated from 5,601 holes, representing 2,588,826 feet of drilling. Changes to the drill hole database for additional verification work completed during 2022 along with additional drilling conducted during 2021 and 2022 led to a change in the mineral resource estimate, when compared with the mineral resource estimate contained in the 2022 Hycroft TRS. 
 The mineral resources were estimated based upon results of the 2023 Hycroft TRS, as determined in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules. 
 Metallurgical and Variability Test Work 
 During 2022, the Company continued the metallurgical and variability test work necessary for designing a sulfide milling operation. This work will establish: (i) a comprehensive and current understanding of how each geologic domain will perform during operations; and (ii) the processing components and reagents required to optimize gold and silver recoveries. The Company is working with consultants to complete this work and expects to receive all test results in April 2023. These results, and results from the 2022-2023 exploration drill program, will be used for designing the mine plan, the type and size of the mill circuit configuration, and the ore haul truck size specifications, among other engineering requirements. 
 Strengthened Balance Sheet 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the following debt and equity activities (discussed in further detail below) that strengthened the Company s balance sheet: 
 Raised gross cash proceeds of 194.4 million through a 55.9 million private placement offering and 138.6 million in an at-the-market equity offering program, before deductions of commissions, fees, and expenses. 
 Amended and restated the Sprott Credit Agreement and made a prepayment of 23.9 million as required under the amended agreement. 
 Amended the Subordinated Notes to extend the debt maturity by two years to December 1, 2027 with continuing 10 interest payable in-kind. 
 Entered into a Note Purchase and Sale Agreement, which reduced the outstanding principal amount of 10 Subordinated Notes by 11.1 million in exchange for (i) payment of 5.6 million and (ii) issuance of 500,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share. 
 Further reduced the Sprott Credit Agreement principal amount through a voluntary 1.1 million prepayment.

 Hycroft Mine 
 Operations 
 The following table provides a summary of operating results for the Hycroft Mine: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Ounces recovered gold (oz) 14,032 57,668 Ounces recovered silver (oz) 37,281 355,967 Ounces sold gold (oz) 17,728 56,045 Ounces sold silver (oz) 44,084 397,546 Average realized sales price gold /oz) 1,819 1,794 Average realized sales price silver /oz) 22.23 25.66 
 As shown above, ounces recovered and ounces sold decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the prior year. These decreases reflect the Company s decision to cease mining operations in November 2021. The Company continued to recover gold and silver from the drain down solutions through August 2022 when it was determined that it was no longer economic to continue adding cyanide to the leach pads. The Company recovered the remaining gold and silver ounces from the drain down solutions as of December 31, 2022.

Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Gold revenue 
 The table below summarizes gold sales, ounces sold and average realized prices for the following periods (dollars in thousands, except per ounce amounts): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Gold revenue 32,249 100,532 Gold ounces sold 17,728 56,045 Average realized price (per ounce) 1,819 1,794 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, gold revenue was 32.2 million and 100.5 million, respectively. The significant decrease in revenue during 2022 was attributable to the cessation of mining operations in November 2021. As a result, significantly less ore was under leach during 2022 as compared to 2021. The Company recovered the remaining gold ounces in the drain down solutions as of December 31, 2022 and does not expect to have additional significant Revenues in 2023. 
 Silver revenue 
 The table below summarizes silver sales, ounces sold and average realized prices for the following periods (dollars in thousands, except per ounce amounts): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Silver revenue 980 10,202 Silver ounces sold 44,084 397,546 Average realized price (per ounce) 22.23 25.94 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, silver revenue was 1.0 million and 10.2 million, respectively. Similar to gold revenue, the decrease in silver revenue during the year ended 2022 was attributable to the cessation of mining activities in November 2021. The Company recovered the remaining silver ounces in the drain down solutions as of December 31, 2022 and does not expect to have additional significant Revenues in 2023. 
 Total cost of sales 
 Total cost of sales consists of Production costs , Depreciation and amortization, Mine site period costs and Write-down of inventories . The table below summarizes total cost of sales for the following periods (dollars in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Production costs 30,756 102,750 Depreciation and amortization 3,361 8,544 Mine site period costs 13,720 38,166 Asset retirement obligation adjustments 4,701 Write-down of materials and supplies inventories 1,051 7,990 Write-down of ore on leach pads 5,888 Total cost of sales 53,589 163,338 
 Production costs 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 30.8 million in Production costs , or 1,735 per ounce of gold sold, compared to 102.8 million, respectively, or 1,833 per ounce of gold, sold during the same period of 2021. The 
 47 

Table of Contents 

decrease in total Production costs was primarily due to a respective decrease in gold ounces sold of 38,317 ounces as well as a decrease due to the cessation of mining activities in 2021 which resulted in less costs capitalized to inventory and expensed upon sale. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization was 3.4 million, or 190 per ounce of gold sold for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 8.5 million, or 152 per ounce of gold sold, during the same period of 2021. The decrease in total Depreciation and amortization costs per ounce of gold sold was largely due to a decrease of 38,317 of gold ounces recovered and sold during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. 
 Mine site period costs 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded 13.7 million of Cost of sales for costs related to maintaining and operating the Hycroft Mine that do not qualify for capitalization to production-related inventories. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded 38.2 million of Cost of sales for costs that were in excess of the net realizable value per ounce of gold inventories. Such period costs were generally the result of costs related to activities at the Hycroft Mine that do not qualify for capitalization to production-related inventories or adjustments to production inventories that were the result of recurring or significant downtime or delays, unusually high levels of repairs, inefficient operations, overuse of processing reagents, inefficient cost-volume structures, or other unusual costs and activities, and cannot be recorded to production-related inventories based on the threshold established by the calculation of the estimated net realizable value per ounce of gold. 
 Asset retirement obligation adjustments 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a change in estimate to its Asset Retirement Obligation of 4.7 million. The change in estimate was the result of updated cost assumptions related to regulatory changes, updated assumptions for regulatory changes requiring additional sloping and expected timing of reclamation activities associated with the Crofoot leach pad prior to recommencing operations. In accordance with the change in estimate, the Company recorded an expense of 4.7 million as the Company does not have mineral reserves and accordingly all costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Write-down of materials and supplies inventories 
 We recorded a Write-down of materials and supplies inventories of 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 for obsolete and slow-moving materials and supplies inventories. The Company evaluates its materials and supplies inventories and records write-downs for items not expected to be used in the next 12 months. 
 We recorded a Write-down of materials and supplies inventories of 8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the following: 
 A write-down of Inventories of 5.9 million for obsolete and slow-moving materials and supplies inventories. As a result of ceasing mining operations, it was determined that certain materials and supplies were not expected to be used in the next 12 months and, accordingly, a reserve was placed against these items. 
 A loss of 2.1 million related to a firm purchase commitment for crusher liners that the Company agreed to purchase under consignment over a period of three years beginning in August 2020. This loss relates to the unfulfilled commitment obligation and has been reduced to reflect the Company s negotiated settlement with the supplier. 
 Write-down of ore on leach pads 
 We recorded a write-down of the non-current portion of Ore on leach pads of 5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 that included 5.5 million for Production costs and 0.4 million of capitalized depreciation and amortization costs related to 3,612 ounces of gold contained in the over liner material on the new larger leach pad which the Company began constructing in 2020. As the 2022 Hycroft TRS did not include mineral reserves, it was determined that the recoverability of these ounces was dependent upon additional work and technical studies and, as a result, it was determined that the ounces and related capitalized amounts should be written-off.

Table of Contents 

General and administrative 
 General and administrative totaled 14.4 million and 14.6 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The decrease of 0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to decreases in salary and compensation costs, including fees paid to our Directors of 1.1 million due to a decrease in headcount after ceasing operations in November 2021, that was partially offset by an increase in legal and consulting fees of 0.8 million as the Company recorded settlement expense of 1.5 million related to a financial advisor that was partially offset by reduced legal fees of 0.6 million. 
 Projects, exploration, and development 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Projects, exploration, and development costs totaled 18.4 million and 13.6 million, respectively. Projects, exploration, and development were related to: (i) completing technical studies; (ii) conducting geological studies; (iii) oversight and project management; and (iv) exploration drilling, engineering, and metallurgical activities. The increase of 4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of Phase 1 of the 2022-2023 exploration program discussed above compared to drilling costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to exploration drilling completed during the 2021 drilling program. 
 Write-off of deposit 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined that additional equipment was no longer expected to be purchased under the current mine plan. Accordingly, a full reserve was applied against the 0.9 million deposit previously paid by the Company to an equipment supplier. See Note 5 Prepaids and Other, Net to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further detail. 
 Accretion 
 We recorded 0.4 million of Accretion during both of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which related to our Asset retirement obligation and future reclamation costs. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligation to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further detail. 
 Impairment loss on assets held for sale 
 We did not record Impairment loss on assets held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2022 as the Company estimated the fair value of the Assets held for sale and determined that the fair value estimate exceeded the carrying value. We recorded 1.8 million of Impairment loss on assets held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2021, as the Company determined that the carrying value of its Assets held for sale exceeded the estimated fair value. See Note 7 Assets Held For Sale to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further detail. 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 
 As discussed and detailed in Note 10 Debt, Net , Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to the Notes to the Financial Statements totaled 18.5 million and 20.6 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The decrease of 2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 was the result of a decrease in the outstanding obligation for the Sprott Credit Agreement as the Company repaid portions of the balance in March 2022 and November 2022. This decrease was offset by an increase in the balance outstanding on the Subordinated Notes at December 31, 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021. The higher outstanding balance for the Subordinated Notes was due to quarterly interest payments that are paid in-kind as additional indebtedness. Additionally, the Company capitalized interest of 0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to its leach pad construction. The Company ceased construction on the new leach pad in February 2021 and, as a result, no further interest was capitalized. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income totaled 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2022, the Company invested a portion of its cash balances in AAAm rated U.S. Government Money Market Funds that are readily convertible to cash. These investments earned the Company 1.9 million in interest during the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company began earning interest on a portion of its Restricted cash balances in June 2022. The Company has earned 0.4 million on its Restricted cash since June 2022.

In addition, the Company paid 0.1 million in legal fees. Total consideration, including legal fees, of 6.1 million was paid which represented a discount of approximately 42 to the face value of the debt. 
 Fair value adjustments to warrants 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Fair value adjustments to warrants resulted in a non-cash gain of 0.2 million, as the market trading values of the publicly listed warrants decreased during the period. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Fair value adjustments to warrants resulted in a non-cash gain of 14.4 million, as the market trading values of the publicly listed warrants decreased, which was primarily due to a decrease in the underlying trading price of the common stock. 
 See Note 12 Warrant Liabilities to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further detail. 
 Gain (loss) on sale of equipment and materials and supplies inventories, net of commissions 
 The Company recognized a Gain on sale of equipment and supplies, net of commissions of 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Subsequent to ceasing mining operations in November 2021, the Company implemented an asset recovery program in order to monetize non-core assets and excess materials and supplies inventories. In addition, the Company sold an uninstalled regrind mill and ball mill that are not expected to be needed for a future milling operation. In conjunction with the sale of the ball mill, the Company paid commissions of 1.1 million to an equipment broker. 
 Income taxes 
 The Company incurred Nil net Income tax benefit or expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an Income tax benefit of 1.5 million which was the result of the Company carrying back its net operating losses to periods that the Company paid income tax prior to the Recapitalization Transaction. The Company has not recorded any future Income tax benefit for net losses, due to a full valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss carryforward. 
 Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC imposes limitations on the use of U.S. federal net operating losses NOLs upon a more than 50 change in ownership in the Company (as defined in the IRC) within a three-year period. In connection with its at-the-market equity offering, the Company underwent a Section 382 ownership change on March 25, 2022. As a result, utilization of the Company s NOLs and certain unrealized losses are limited on an annual basis. If the Section 382 annual limitation amount is not fully utilized in a particular tax year, then the unused portion from that tax year is added to the Section 382 annual limitation in subsequent years. The Company s annual limitation under Section 382 is estimated to be approximately 1.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 The Company s unrestricted cash position at December 31, 2022 was 142.0 million as compared with 12.3 million at December 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 14 Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the Financial Statements, the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately 194.4 million in March 2022, before deduction of commissions and expenses, through the following equity financings: 
 On March 14, 2022, the Company entered into the Subscription Agreements with AMC and 2176423 Ontario Limited pursuant to which the Company sold on March 15, 2022 an aggregate of 46,816,480 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at a purchase price of 1.193 per unit for total gross proceeds, before deduction of fees and expenses, of 55.9 million. 
 On March 15, 2022, the Company implemented the ATM Program. On March 25, 2022, the Company terminated the ATM Program and announced that it had sold 89,553,584 shares of common stock under the ATM Program and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately 138.6 million. 
 In order to amend the Sprott Credit Agreement to facilitate these financings and extend the maturity of this agreement, the Company prepaid 23.9 million in March 2022. 
 In late 2021 and early 2022, to avoid potential non-compliance with the Sprott Credit Agreement, the Company obtained a series of waivers and entered into amendments to the Sprott Credit Agreement. See Debt Covenants below and Note 10 Debt, Net in the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding additional waivers received and modifications to the Sprott Credit Agreement, including the Second A R Agreement. 
 As the Company completed recovering gold and silver ounces previously placed on the leach pad in 2022, the Company does not expect to generate net positive cash for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company will be dependent on its unrestricted cash and other sources of cash to fund the business. Historically, the Company has been dependent on various forms of debt and equity financing to fund its business. While the Company has been successful in the past raising funds through equity and debt financings, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to it in amounts sufficient to meet the Company s needs or on terms acceptable to the Company. In the event that funds are not available, the Company may be required to materially change its business plan. 
 The Company s future liquidity and capital resources management strategy entails a disciplined approach to monitor the timing and extent of any drilling, metallurgical and mineralogical studies while attempting to remain in a position that allows the Company to respond to changes in the business environment, such as a decrease in metal prices or lower than forecasted future cash flows, and changes in other factors beyond the Company s control. The Company has undertaken efforts aimed at managing its liquidity and preserving its capital resources by, among other things: (i) monitoring metal prices and the impacts (near-term and future) they have on the business and cash flows; (ii) ceasing open pit mining operations to reduce net cash outflows; (iii) reducing the size of the workforce to reflect the cessation of mining operations; (iv) controlling working capital and managing discretionary spending; (v) reviewing contractor usage and rental agreements for more economic options, including termination of certain agreements in accordance with their terms; (vi) decreasing Restricted Cash balances that collateralize bonds, as available; and (vii) planning the timing and amounts of capital expenditures and drilling, metallurgical and mineralogical study costs at the Hycroft Mine and deferring such items that are not expected to benefit our near term operating plans. The Company has undertaken and continues to undertake additional efforts including: (i) monetizing non-core fixed assets and excess materials and supplies inventories; (ii) returning excess rental and leased equipment; (iii) selling uninstalled mills that are not expected to be needed for a future milling operation; and (iv) working with existing debt holders to adjust debt service requirements. 
 In addition, the Company will continue to evaluate alternatives to raise additional capital necessary to fund the future development of the Hycroft Mine and will continue to explore other strategic initiatives to enhance stockholder value. 
 Cash and liquidity

 Cash used in operating activities 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used 34.9 million of cash in operating activities primarily attributable to a net loss of 60.8 million, the cash impact of which was equal to 39.5 million, and 9.7 million was provided by working capital, which included a 15.8 million decrease for production-related inventories as the Company processed the remaining gold and silver ore on its leach pads and in its drain down solutions, which was partly offset by cash used to reduce Accounts payable of 3.8 million. The largest non-cash items included in net loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 included a 5.0 million Gain on extinguishment of debt, Non-cash portion of interest expense of 13.1 million and Asset retirement obligation adjustments of 4.7 million. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company used 37.0 million of cash in operating activities primarily attributable to a net loss of 88.6 million, the cash impact of which was equal to 57.7 million, and 20.7 million provided by working capital, which included 29.0 million used to increase production-related inventories.

Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, investing activities provided cash of 8.3 million primarily from the sale of assets previously held for sale , for net proceeds of 6.6 million and other mobile mine equipment and materials and supplies for net proceeds of 2.7 million. In addition, the Company purchased equipment of 1.0 million. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company used 6.9 million in investing activities which primarily related to expenditures of (i) 2.7 million for purchased equipment and refurbishments; (ii) 2.5 million spent for the leach pad expansion project (which excludes 0.7 million of capitalized interest) to complete construction to the appropriate point in which we believe there would be minimal risk of adverse impacts to the leach pad.

 Future capital and cash requirements 
 The following table provides the Company s gross contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2022, which are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The Company believes that the following provides the most meaningful presentation of near-term obligations expected to be satisfied using current and available sources of liquidity (dollars in thousands): 
 Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating activities: Net smelter royalty (1) 
 240,506 6 240,500 Remediation and reclamation expenditures (2) 
 76,795 4,717 4,890 67,188 Interest payments (3)

 (1) Under the Sprott Royalty Agreement, the Company is required to pay a perpetual royalty equal to 1.5 of the Net Smelter Returns from the Hycroft Mine, payable monthly that also includes an additional amount for withholding taxes payable by the royalty holder. Amounts presented above incorporate mineral resource estimates as reported in the 2023 Hycroft TRS and are based on consensus pricing for gold and silver. See Note 11 Deferred Gain on Sale of Royalty to the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they are conducted and we are required, upon cessation of operations, to reclaim and remediate the lands that our operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted and inflated cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. In the above presentation, no offset has been applied for the 58.3 million of our reclamation bonds or for the 34.0 million of cash collateral for those bonds included in Restricted Cash . 
 (3) Repayments of principal on debt consists of amounts due under the Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement), the Subordinated Notes and notes payable for equipment purchases. Included in the repayment of the Subordinated Notes principal is interest that has been capitalized as payable in-kind on a quarterly basis, and on a monthly basis for the Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement) for the first 12 months after the initial advance. Also included in the repayment 
 53 

Table of Contents 

of the Sprott Credit Agreement is the 3.3 million fee that has been capitalized as payable in-kind in connection with the Second A R Agreement. See Note 10 Debt, Net to the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (4) The Company is required to pay a 4 net profits royalty, including advance royalty payments of 120,000 in any year where mining occurs on the Crofoot claims and an additional 120,000 if tons mined from the Crofoot claim blocks exceed 5.0 million tons Crofoot Royalty ). See Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. Amounts shown represent the current estimates of cash payment timing using consensus pricing for gold and silver. 
 (5) Additional interest payments consist of repayments of additional interest under the Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement), commencing February 28, 2021 (with the first cash payment due three months after such date) and ending on the maturity date. See Note 10 Debt, Net to the Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. 
 In addition, the Company may enter into service agreements from time-to-time with drilling contractors or other consultants to perform work on or related to the Hycroft Mine. In general, these agreements are on an as-needed basis and do not have ongoing commitments and, as such, have not been included in the table above/ 
 Debt covenants 
 The Company s debt agreements contain representations and warranties, events of default, restrictions and limitations, reporting requirements, and covenants that are customary for agreements of these types. 
 The Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement) contains covenants that, among other things, restrict or limit the ability of the Company to enter into encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), incur indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness), dispose of its assets (other than Permitted Disposals), pay dividends, and purchase or redeem shares, as such terms are defined in the Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement). The Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement) requires the Company to ensure that, at all times, both its Working Capital and Unrestricted Cash is at least 15.0 million and its Working Capital is at least 10.0 million, as such terms are defined in the Sprott Credit Agreement (as amended by the Second A R Agreement), and that at least every six months the Company demonstrates its ability to repay and meet all present and future obligations as they become due with a financial model that uses consensus gold prices discounted by 5.0 . The Subordinated Notes include customary events of default, including those relating to a failure to pay principal or interest, a breach of a covenant, representation or warranty, a cross-default to other indebtedness, and non-compliance with security documents. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt agreements. 
 On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into the February 2022 Waiver and Amendment with the Lender amending the November 2021 Waiver. Pursuant to the February 2022 Waiver and Amendment, the Lender: (i) waived the Company s obligation under the Sprott Credit Agreement (as then amended in 2020) to maintain at least 9.0 million of Unrestricted Cash on the last day of each calendar month during the period ending May 10, 2022 (the Waiver Period ), provided that, the Company maintained at least 7.5 million of Unrestricted Cash on the last day of February 2022 and at least 9.0 million on the last day of each month thereafter during the Waiver Period; (ii) waived all obligations of the Company to prepay the facility with the net cash proceeds of any Mill Asset Sales (as defined in the February 2022 Waiver and Amendment) until the earlier of: (a) the date on which the Company completes a private placement or other offering or issuance of its equity securities (the Offering Date and (b) March 31, 2022; and (iii) extended the payment due date for the additional February interest payment and the February principal payment until the earlier of: (a) the Offering Date; and (b) March 31, 2022. Further, pursuant to the February 2022 Waiver and Amendment, any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of the preceding sentence would constitute an immediate Event of Default under the Credit Agreement. 
 On March 11, 2022, the Company entered into the March 2022 Sprott Agreement with the Lender with respect to the Sprott Credit Agreement. As described in the March 2022 Sprott Agreement, the Company was contemplating Equity Financing Transactions to be completed on or before March 31, 2022. Pursuant to the March 2022 Sprott Agreement, if the Equity Financing Transactions result (or were likely to result pursuant to definitive subscription underwriting and/or similar legally binding agreements) in the Company s receipt of total gross cash proceeds (before deduction of fees and expenses) of the Required Equity Amount on or before March 31, 2022, the Lender and the Company were obligated to amend the principal repayment terms under the Sprott Credit Agreement such that no further scheduled payments of principal shall be required prior to May 31, 2025 (the Maturity Date (i.e., there will be no required regular amortization payments of the facility and the full principal balance of the facility shall be due and payable in a single bullet payment on the Maturity Date). The consummation of the Private Placement satisfied the Required Equity Amount condition in the March 2022 Sprott Agreement. 
 The March 2022 Sprott Agreement also provided that, in connection with the modification of the required facility amortization payments, the Company shall pay to the Lender an amount equal to 3.3 million, with such payment to be capitalized and added to the principal amount owing under the Sprott Credit Agreement and accrue interest at the same rate and upon the same terms as the existing loans under the Sprott Credit Agreement; provided, the payment or prepayment of such 
 54 

Table of Contents 

capitalized principal amount shall not be subject to the Prepayment Premium (as defined in the Sprott Credit Agreement) or any other penalty or premium. 
 On March 14, 2022, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Lender to modify the terms of the Sprott Credit Agreement and other applicable loan documents. On March 30, 2022, the Company and Lender under the Sprott Credit Agreement entered into the Second A R Agreement, which: (a) extended the maturity date for all of the loans and other principal obligations under the Sprott Credit Facility by two years, to May 31, 2027; (b) provided for the Initial Equity Proceeds Prepayment in the amount of 10.0 million promptly upon the Company s receipt of cash proceeds from the Private Placement; (c) provided for the Subsequent Equity Proceeds Prepayments in the amount of 13.9 million (representing 10 of the subsequent issuance of its equity interests consummated on or prior to March 31, 2022); and (d) eliminated the prepayment premiums otherwise payable with respect to the Initial Equity Proceeds Prepayment, the Subsequent Equity Proceeds Prepayments and all future prepayments of principal under the Sprott Credit Facility. In addition, the Company s obligations to: (i) prepay principal with proceeds of asset sales were credited/offset by the 23.9 million aggregate amount of Initial Equity Proceeds Prepayment and the Subsequent Equity Proceeds Prepayments; and (ii) to maintain a minimum amount of Unrestricted Cash was increased to 15.0 million. Pursuant to the agreement in principle, the Company made the Initial Equity Proceeds Prepayment of 10.0 million and paid in kind a 3.3 million fee in connection with the modification and capitalized it to principal on March 16, 2022 and following the execution of the Second A R Agreement on March 30, 2022, the Company: (i) paid the previously deferred additional interest payment of 0.5 million; and (ii) made the Subsequent Equity Proceeds Prepayment of 13.9 million. 
 In addition, in November 2022, the Company prepaid an additional principal amount of 1.1 million for the Sprott Credit Agreement. After giving effect to such prepayments discussed above, the outstanding principal balance under the Second A R Agreement was as of December 31, 2022 to be 55.2 million (before issuance discounts) including unpaid additional interest of approximately 5.5 million. 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of a net profit royalty arrangement and a net smelter royalty arrangement (see Note 23 Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to the Financial Statements).

Accounting Developments 
 The following accounting pronouncements were adopted by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022: 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ). ASU 2020-06 simplifies guidance on accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity including calculating diluted earnings per share. For emerging growth companies, the new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022, with no material impact on its financial statements or the related disclosures. 
 In December of 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ASU 2019-12 ), as part as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Amendments include removal of certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes and simplification in several other areas such as accounting for a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income. For emerging growth companies, the new guidance was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and the Company adopted ASU 2019-12 as of January 1, 2022, with no material impact on its financial statements or the related disclosures. 
 In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) . ASU 2021-04 clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options e.g., warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. ASU 2021-04 provides guidance that will clarify whether an issuer should account for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as (i) an adjustment to equity and, if so, the related earnings per share effects, if any, or (ii) an expense and, if so, the manner and pattern of recognition. For emerging growth companies, the new guidance was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and the Company adopted ASU 2021-04 as of January 1, 2022, with no material impact on its financial statements or the related disclosures. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 MD A is based on our Financial Statements, that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time our estimates are made. Actual results may differ from amounts estimated in these statements, and such difference could be material. As such, future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. 
 Although other estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. For information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets 
 Estimate Required: 
 Our long-lived assets consist of Plant and equipment, net . We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Events that may trigger a test for recoverability include, but are not limited to, significant adverse changes to projected Revenues , costs, or future expansion plans or changes to federal and state regulations (with which we must comply) that may adversely impact our current or future operations. An impairment is determined to exist if the total projected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the excess carrying value of the impaired long-lived asset group over fair value. 
 To determine fair value, we used a market-based approach for determining fair value based on sales transactions of comparable assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. Our estimates of future cash flows from the potential sale of our assets are based on numerous assumptions that are consistent or reasonable in relation to transactions occurring in the market 
 56 

Table of Contents 

and actual future cash flows may be significantly different than the estimates as each are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. 
 Impact of Change in Estimate: 
 The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2022 were based on sales transactions of comparable assets. We compared the 113.0 million estimated fair value, after allocating the fair value to other assets and liabilities, to the carrying value of our Plant and equipment, net of 54.8 million, and given the large surplus between the estimated fair value of the Company and the carrying value of our Plant and equipment, net a change in the estimates used in the mark-based approach would be unlikely to result in an impairment as of December 31, 2022. 
 Asset retirement obligation 
 Estimate Required: 
 We will be required to perform reclamation activity at the Hycroft Mine in the future. As a result of this requirement, an Asset retirement obligation has been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that is based on our expectation of the costs that will be incurred years in the future. Any underestimate or unanticipated reclamation costs or any changes in governmental reclamation requirements could require us to record or incur additional reclamation costs. We accrue an Asset retirement obligation when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized Asset retirement obligation becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased or decreased, the amount of that liability and any additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to stockholders. 
 Impact of Change in Estimate: 
 Based on the proposed 34-year mine plan which was the basis of our operations when we ceased mining activities in November 2021, and which we believe remains the best estimate for the life of mine, the Company expects to perform substantially all of its reclamation activities beginning in 2047 upon the estimated closure of the Hycroft Mine. In addition, the Company expects to perform reclamation activities for its Crofoot heap leach pad beginning in 2026 and continuing through 2028. If the reclamation activities expected to be performed upon closure of the Hycroft Mine were to begin ten years earlier or later than currently assumed our reclamation liability would increase or decrease by approximately 3.7 million and 1.7 million, respectively. Adjustments may occur due to a change in estimate due to timing, costs assumptions, or regulatory requirements. 
 Warrant liabilities 
 Estimate Required: 
 
 We account for the 5-Year Private Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that are not indexed to our own stock as liabilities at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value of the 5-Year Private Warrants until the earlier of the (i) exercise or expiration of the 5-Year Private Warrants or (ii) the transfer of any 5-Year Private Warrants to any person who is not a permitted transferee, at which time the applicable Warrant liabilities will be extinguished. The terms of the 5-Year Private Warrants are substantially identical to the 5-Year Public Warrants except the 5-Year Private Warrants, while held by the SPAC sponsor and/or SPAC underwriter and their permitted transferees, are precluded from mandatory redemption and are entitled to exercise on a cashless bases at the holder s election. Accordingly, we use a Black-Scholes model with an appropriate estimate of volatility considering volatility of the 5-Year Public Warrants and using a Monte Carlo simulation model to incorporate the redemption and cashless exercise features in the 5-Year Private Warrants. Increases (decreases) in the assumptions result in a directionally similar impact to the fair value of the Warrant liabilities . 
 
 Impact of Change in Estimate: 
 
 A 0.01 increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of 5-Year Private Warrants would increase or decrease the Warrant liabilities , by 0.1 million with the offset in Other income (expense).

 million and net working capital of million which is expected to provide it with the necessary liquidity to fund its operating and investing requirements and future obligations as they become due within the next twelve months from the date of this filing. 
 The Company generated revenue in 2022 from processing gold and silver ore previously placed on leach pads prior to ceasing mining operations in November 2021 that partially offset the cash used in its operations and investing activities. Since the Company completed processing of gold and silver ore as of December 31, 2022, the Company does not expect to generate net positive cash from operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company will be dependent on its unrestricted cash and other sources of cash to fund its business. As discussed in Note 14 Stockholders Equity, the Company raised gross proceeds of million in the year ended December 31, 2022 through the following equity financings: 
 On March 14, 2022, the Company entered into subscription agreements with American Multi-Cinema, Inc. AMC and 2176423 Ontario Limited, an entity affiliated with Eric Sprott, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of units at a purchase price of per unit for total gross proceeds, before deduction of fees and expenses, of million. 
 On March 15, 2022, the Company implemented an ATM pursuant to which the Company registered the offer and sale from time to time of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million of gross proceeds.

 Also, as discussed in Note 10 Debt, Net , as a result of the equity financings above, the Company reached an agreement with Sprott Private Resource Lending II (Collector), LP (the Lender with respect to the Credit Agreement among Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, as borrower, Autar Gold Corporation, MUDS, MUDS Holdco Inc., Allied VGH LLC, Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC, Sprott Private Resource Lending II (Collector) Inc., and Sprott Resources Lending Corp. Sprott Credit Agreement ), which required the Company to prepay principal under the facility in the amount of million following the Company s receipt of the million cash proceeds discussed above. The Company also made additional prepayments of million in March 2022 and million in November 2022. 
 In addition to the above equity financings, the Company will continue to evaluate alternatives to raise additional capital necessary to fund the future exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine and will continue to explore other strategic initiatives to enhance stockholder value. 
 Historically, the Company has been dependent on various forms of debt and equity financing to fund its business. While the Company has been successful in the past raising funds through equity and debt financings, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to it in amounts sufficient to meet the Company s needs or on terms acceptable to the Company. In the event that funds are not available, the Company may be required to materially change its business plan.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a change in estimate to the ARO of million. The change in estimate was due to updated assumptions regarding cost estimate, regulatory changes requiring additional sloping, and timing of costs for reclamation activities associated with the Crofoot leach pad prior to recommencing operations.

 Based on the weight of evidence available as of both December 31, 2022, and 2021, which included recent operating results, future projections, and historical inability to generate operating cash flow, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the benefit of its net deferred tax assets would not be realized and, as such, recorded full valuation allowances of million and million, respectively, against its net deferred tax assets. 
 The Company had net operating loss carryovers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of million and million, respectively, for federal income tax purposes. The carryforward amount as of December 31, 2022 can be carried forward indefinitely and can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods, subject to limitations under Section 382. 
 Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on the use of U.S. federal net operating losses upon a more than 50 change in ownership in the Company within a three-year period. In connection with its at-the-market equity offering, the Company underwent a Section 382 ownership change on March 25, 2022. As a result, utilization of million of the Company s net operating losses and certain unrealized losses are limited on an annual basis. The Company s annual limitation under Section 382 is approximately million. If the Section 382 annual limitation amount is not fully utilized in a particular tax year, then the unused portion from that tax year is added to the Section 382 annual limitation in subsequent years. 
 As necessary, the Company provides a reserve against the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken in its tax filings that are more likely than not to not be sustained upon examination. Based on the weight of available evidence, the Company does not believe it has taken any uncertain tax positions that require the establishment of a reserve. The Company has not recorded any income tax reserves or related interest or penalties related to income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The Company s policy, if it were to have uncertain tax positions, is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by taxing authorities for tax years 2018 and prior; however, net operating loss and credit carryforwards from all years are subject to examinations and adjustments for at least three years following the year in which the attributes are used.

 5-Year Private Warrants 
 The Private Warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes model that requires a variety of inputs including the Company s stock price, the strike price of the Private Warrants, the risk-free rate, and the implied volatility. As the terms of the Private Warrants are identical to the terms of the Public Warrants except that the Private Warrants, while held by certain holders or their permitted transferees, are precluded from mandatory redemption and are entitled to be exercise on a cashless basis at the holder s election, the implied volatility used in the Black-Scholes model is calculated using a Monte-Carlo model of the Public Warrants that factors in the restrictive redemption and cashless exercise features of the Private Warrants. The Company updates the fair value calculation on at least a quarterly basis, or more frequently if changes in circumstances and assumptions indicate a change from the existing carrying value. 
 Seller Warrants 
 The Seller Warrant Agreement contains certain terms and features to reduce the exercise price and increase the number of shares of common stock each warrant is exercisable into. As a result, Seller Warrants were considered derivative financial instruments and carried at fair value. The fair value of Seller Warrants was computed by an independent third-party consultant (and validated by the Company) using a Monte Carlo simulation-based model that requires a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, exercise prices, equity volatility and discount rates. The Company updated the fair value calculation on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if changes in circumstances and assumptions indicate a change from the existing carrying value. As of October 22, 2022 the Seller Warrants expired pursuant to their terms and are longer exercisable or outstanding.

Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer determined that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives, and that management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting is promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 96 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of the control. While the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

These committees composition, duties, and responsibilities are set forth below. 
 Audit Committee 
 Sean D. Goodman, David C. Naccarati, and Marni Wieshofer (Chair) are the members of the Audit Committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, the Audit Committee must have at least three members. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), require the audit committee of a listed company to be comprised solely of independent directors.

 The Nominating and Governance Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate a search firm to identify director candidates and has sole authority to approve the search firm s fees and other retention terms. 
 The Nominating and Governance Committee has not set specific minimum qualifications for director positions. Instead, after considering the Board s current composition, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews nominations for election or re-election to the Board based on a particular candidate s merits and the Company s needs. When evaluating candidates for nomination, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers an individual s skills, diversity, independence, experience in areas that address the needs of the Board, and ability to devote adequate time to Board duties. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not specifically define diversity but values the diversity of experience, perspective, education, race, gender, and national origin as part of its annual evaluation of director nominees for election or re- 
 101 

election. When a new Board seat or a vacated Board seat is being filled, candidates who best fit the needs of the Board and the Company will be interviewed and evaluated by the Nominating and Governance Committee. Candidates selected by the Nominating and Governance Committee are recommended to the full Board of Directors. 
 While the Company maintains a plurality voting standard in director elections, it also adopted a majority voting standard. Under that standard, a director in an uncontested election who receives more withheld votes than votes for their election must tender their resignation. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider such offered resignation and recommend an action to the full Board, which will determine whether to accept or reject that resignation. 
 Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee 
 Michael Harrison (Chair), Stephen Lang, and David C. Naccarati are the Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee members. 
 Under its charter, the functions of the Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee include the authority to: 
 investigate any activity of the Company or its subsidiaries relating to health, safety, loss prevention and operational security, sustainable development, environmental affairs, public policy and relations with communities and civil society, government relations, human rights, and communication matters; 
 review developmental, construction and operational activities; and 
 retain outside counsel, experts and other advisors as the Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee may deem appropriate in its sole discretion to assist the Company in fulfilling its responsibilities. 
 Director Independence 
 The Board has determined that Messrs. Goodman, Harrison, Lang, Naccarati, and Weng, and Ms. Wieshofer are independent directors under Nasdaq listing standards. The Board reviews independence annually and has also determined that each current member of the Company s Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee is independent as defined under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards and SEC rules. The Board further determined that Ms. Wieshofer qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under applicable rules and guidance. In making these determinations, the Board found that none of the directors had a material or other disqualifying relationship with the Company. 
 In connection with the review and determination of the independence of directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the relationship of Mr. Harrison to the various Sprott entities. Mr. Harrison is a Managing Director of Sprott, Inc. and the Managing Partner of Sprott Resource Streaming and Royalty SRSR ), an affiliate of Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO), Inc., the payee under the Sprott Royalty Agreement. Under the Nasdaq independence rules, Nasdaq considers payments to or from a listed company in excess of 5 of the recipient s gross revenues a bar to the independence of a director if that director is a partner, controlling stockholder, or executive officer of such other party. In addition, certain institutional stockholder organizations, such as ISS, consider a transactional relationship to be material if the Company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the recipient s gross revenues. The Company s annual payments to SRSR did not exceed the ISS test or the Nasdaq independence threshold. Therefore, any payments under the Sprott Royalty Agreement in 2022 did not preclude a finding of Mr. Harrison s independence by the Board under Nasdaq rules or ISS guidelines. 
 Board and Committee Meetings 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Board held 23 meetings and acted by unanimous written consent 11 times. The Audit Committee held 8 meetings. The Nominating and Governance Committee held 3 meetings and acted 3 times by unanimous written consent. The Compensation Committee held 3 meetings and acted by unanimous written consent 2 times. The Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee held 6 meetings. During 2022, each director attended more than 75 of the combined meetings of the Board and each committee on which he or she served. 
 102 

Code of Ethics 
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, executive officers, and employees that complies with SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations. The Code of Ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of the Company s business. A copy of the Code of Ethics has been posted on our website at www.hycroftmining.com . It is free of charge upon written request to our Corporate Secretary at c/o Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, P.O. Box 3030, Winnemucca, Nevada 89446. The Company intends to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of its Code of Ethics on its website. 
 
 Hedging and Pledging Policy 
 
 The Company has adopted a policy regarding the ability of certain persons to hedge, pledge or otherwise limit their exposure to the Company s securities. The policy applies to (i) the Company s directors and executive officers Company Insiders (ii) employees who regularly come into possession of material non-public information about the Company in the course of their duties (together with the Company Insiders, the Covered Persons (iii) any Covered Person s spouse, other people living in a Covered Person s household, and minor children; and (iv) entities over which any Covered Person exercises control. Under the policy, each of such persons is prohibited from engaging in the following transactions in the Company s securities unless advance approval is granted by the Company s Chief Financial Officer: 
 Short-term tradin g . Company Insiders who purchase Company securities may not sell any Company securities of the same class for at least six months after the purchase; 
 Short sales . Covered Persons may not sell the Company s securities short; 
 Options trading . Covered Persons may not buy or sell puts or calls, or other derivative securities on the Company s securities; 
 Trading on margin or pledging . Company Insiders may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan; and 
 Hedging . Covered Persons may not enter into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements relating to Company securities. This provision is not construed to limit a Covered Person s ability to enter into market hedges not tied to the Company s securities, including transactions to hedge commodity (gold and silver) exposure. 
 Board Oversight of Risk Management 
 The Board of Directors considers oversight of the Company s risk management efforts, including enterprise risk management, to be a responsibility of the entire Board (as reported by and through the appropriate committee in the case of risks under the purview of a particular committee). Management regularly updates the full Board on major Company initiatives, strategies, and related risks. On an annual basis, management reviews with the Board risks to the enterprise and efforts to address them. In addition, presentations are made in the ordinary course at scheduled Board meetings regarding operations, finance, market trends, and the various other risks that face the Company. On an ongoing basis, the various committees of the Board address risk in the areas germane to their scope. For example: 
 The Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee oversees risks in the areas of safety and environmental compliance through an ongoing dialog with management, plays a role in operational risk management, including policy and regulatory risk, and oversees risk associated with managing existing technologies and developing new technologies to enhance and protect our competitive advantage; 
 The Finance Committee plays a vital role in the oversight of financial and market risk, balance sheet risk and capital allocation, liquidity, and tax risk; 
 The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates Board effectiveness, succession planning, and general corporate best practices; 
 The Compensation Committee oversees the Company s policies to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees and ties compensation to actual performance, including risks associated with executive compensation; and 
 The Audit Committee provides risk oversight of the Company s financial statements, the Company s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and controls, including controls over financial reporting, computerized information systems and cyber security, the independent auditor s selection, retention, qualifications, objectivity and independence, and the performance of the Company s internal audit function. 
 The chairperson of the relevant Board committee reports on the committee s discussions to the entire Board during the committee reports portion of the applicable Board meeting. 
 103 

Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
 The Company s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will periodically appoint a Chairman of the Board and that independent and management directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, are eligible for appointment as Chairman. The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that if the Chairman of the Board is not independent, then the Board should designate an independent lead director who would be available in any situation in which the Chairman has a potential conflict of interest concerning any matter under consideration. 
 On April 8, 2022, the Board appointed Stephen Lang as Chairman of the Board, succeeding Ms. Garrett, who previously served as Acting Chairman. Ms. Garrett remains a non-independent director. Although Mr. Lang is an independent director, the Board appointed Mr. Weng as Lead Independent Director. 
 The Board believes that our current Board leadership structure, which includes a Lead Independent Director and separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles, provides strong oversight, which benefits our stockholders. The Board believes its current leadership structure best serves the objectives of the Board s oversight of management, the Board s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of the Company s shareholders, and the Company s overall corporate governance. The Board also believes that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus her time and energy on operating and managing the Company, while leveraging our Chairman s experience and perspectives in an oversight role. The separation of roles also allows an effective balance between strong executive leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by the Chairman and other independent directors. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve the Company and its stockholders. 
 Executive Sessions of Independent Directors 
 The independent directors of the Board and each standing committee meet regularly in executive sessions without management present. Stockholders wishing to communicate with the independent directors may contact them by writing to Independent Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, P.O. Box 3030, Winnemucca, Nevada 89446.

 Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
 Our compensation policies and philosophies are designed to align compensation with our business objectives and the creation of stockholder value, while enabling us to attract, motivate, and retain individuals who contribute to the Company s long-term success. 
 113 

The Compensation Committee believes the executive compensation program must be competitive to attract and retain our executive officers. The Compensation Committee has implemented compensation policies and philosophies that link a significant portion of our executive officers cash compensation to performance objectives and by providing a portion of their compensation as long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards. 
 Our annual compensation review is undertaken at the direction and under the supervision of the Compensation Committee. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, no executive officers are involved in making recommendations for executive officer compensation, and no executive officer makes any recommendations for their compensation. Additionally, no executive officers are involved in determining director compensation. At its sole discretion, the Compensation Committee may engage independent compensation consultants exclusively to advise the Compensation Committee on executive officer and director compensation matters. 
 In 2022, the Compensation Committee engaged Semler Brossy to provide independent advice on executive officer and director compensation matters. In 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged Lane Caputo to provide independent advice on executive officer and director compensation matters. The Compensation Committee, utilizing the compensation consultant s report and after discussion and review (i) approves the annual base salaries, (ii) equity award grants, (iii) incentive cash award targets, (iv) financial metrics for the upcoming year, and (v) incentive cash awards for the prior year for the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee performs its compensation review and decision-making duties without management present. 
 Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews management s recommendations and historical pay and performance information in the first quarter of each year. The Compensation Committee s review includes approval of the value of equity award grants. It is generally the Compensation Committee s policy to authorize and grant equity awards as of the date of the Board of Directors meeting (typically in March). The awards are then ratified by the non-management members of the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The equity awards are based upon the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of the award. 
 The Compensation Committee does not have a specific policy or practice to time equity awards to the release of earnings or other material non-public information. However, the Compensation Committee may determine the value of an equity award but not issue or establish the number of shares or share units while possessing material non-public information, such as a material pending transaction. Our practice is not to accelerate or delay the disclosure of material non-public information, whether favorable or unfavorable, but to make such disclosures when appropriate or required by applicable securities laws. In order not to unduly benefit or harm officers and employees, the Compensation Committee would consider postponing the issuance of awards until after the non-public information has been publicly disclosed or is no longer considered material information. 
 Periodically throughout the year, the Compensation Committee may discuss, as appropriate, the philosophy for the overall compensation program and determine if changes in particular program components or special awards are appropriate or desirable during the current year or for future periods. 
 Compensation for our executive officers will have three primary components: base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus, and long-term equity-based incentive compensation. 
 Base Salary 
 Base salaries are set to be fair to the executive officers, competitive within the industry, and reasonable in light of our cost structure. The Compensation Committee determines base salaries, subject to the terms of any employment agreements, and reviews base salaries annually based upon advice and counsel from its advisors. With the raising of approximately 194 million in gross proceeds before deducting commissions, fees, and expenses in late March 2022, the Compensation Committee reviewed annual base salaries for executive officers for 2022 in the second quarter of 2022. Acknowledging the efforts of Ms. Garrett and Mr. Rideout in (i) managing the Company; (ii) issuing a new initial assessment technical report; (iii) extending the maturity and restructuring certain payment terms of the Company s outstanding indebtedness; and (iv) raising substantial equity capital to address the Company s going concern and critical liquidity issues, determined to increase the annual base salary of Ms. Garrett by 50,000 to 600,000 per year and to increase the annual base salary of Mr. Rideout by 50,000 from 375,000 to 425,000, each effective as of April 1, 2022. 
 Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses 
 In 2022, the Compensation Committee used annual cash incentive bonuses for the NEOs to tie a portion of the NEOs compensation to financial and operational objectives achievable within the applicable fiscal year, such as (i) gold and gold equivalent production/sales, (ii) total cash costs of production per gold or gold equivalent ounce, (iii) health and safety, and/or 
 114 

(iv) such other metrics as are determined from time to time by the Board. At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee sets performance targets, target amounts, target award opportunities, and other terms and conditions of annual cash bonuses for the NEOs. At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee determines the extent the performance targets were achieved and the amount of the award, if any, payable to the NEOs. 
 Equity-Based Awards 
 The Compensation Committee will use equity-based awards to reward long-term performance of the NEOs under the Incentive Plan. Providing a meaningful portion of the total compensation package in the form of equity-based awards is an essential element to compensation arrangements to align the incentives of its officers, including its NEOs, with the interests of its stockholders and serve to motivate and retain the NEOs. 
 Executive Agreements 
 The Company has entered into compensation arrangements with its officers, including employment agreements and equity award agreements, as part of its policy to pay and compensate key executives as appropriate to attract, retain, and compensate executive talent. 
 Other Compensation 
 We have maintained the various employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, life insurance and 401(k) plans, offered by the Company in which the NEOs participate. 
 Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
 Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), denies a federal income tax deduction for certain compensation in excess of 1.0 million per year paid to certain current and former executive officers of a publicly traded corporation. 
 Director Compensation 
 The Compensation Committee and Board of Directors approved the following initial annual director compensation arrangements, for non-employee directors: 
 an annual cash retainer of 55,000; 
 annual committee chair fees of 12,500 for the Audit Committee, 10,000 for the Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee, and 7,500 for each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committees; 
 annual committee member fees of 5,000 for the Audit Committee, 4,000 for the Safety, Sustainability and Technical Committee, and 2,500 for each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee; and 
 75,000 in annual equity awards in the form of restricted stock units RSUs ). 
 In addition, the Compensation Committee approved (i) an initial 50,000 equity award for each non-employee director upon their initial appointment to the Board; (ii) an annual 10,000 cash retainer for the independent Lead Director; and (iii) an annual 70,000 retainer for a non-employee independent Chairman of the Board of which 25,000 is payable in cash and 45,000 payable in RSUs, based upon the expected attention and workload as the Company addressed its financial issues. 
 The equity awards are granted to each non-employee director at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.

 Related Party Policy 
 Our Audit Committee, pursuant to its charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. 
 These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee, or officer. 
 Director Independence 
 The Board has determined that Messrs. Goodman, Harrison, Lang, Naccarati, and Weng, and Ms. Wieshofer are independent directors under Nasdaq listing standards. The Board reviews independence annually and has also determined that each current member of the Company s Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee is independent as defined under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards and SEC rules. The Board further determined that Ms. Wieshofer qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under applicable rules and guidance. In making these determinations, the Board found that none of the directors had a material or other disqualifying relationship with the Company. 
 In connection with the review and determination of the independence of directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the relationship of Mr. Harrison to the various Sprott entities. Mr. Harrison is a Managing Director of Sprott, Inc. and the Managing Partner of Sprott Resource Streaming and Royalty SRSR ), an affiliate of Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO), Inc., the payee under the Sprott Royalty Agreement. Under the Nasdaq independence rules, Nasdaq considers payments to or from a listed company in excess of 5 of the recipient s gross revenues a bar to the independence of a director if that director is a partner, controlling stockholder, or executive officer of such other party. In addition, certain institutional stockholder organizations, such as ISS, consider a transactional relationship to be material if the Company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the recipient s gross revenues. The Company s annual payments to SRSR did not exceed the ISS test or the Nasdaq independence threshold. Therefore, any payments under the Sprott Royalty Agreement in 2022 did not preclude a finding of Mr. Harrison s independence by the Board under Nasdaq rules or ISS guidelines.

 Exhibit 95.1 

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 
 
 Mine Safety Information 
 
 Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the operator (e.g., our subsidiary, Hycroft Resources & Development Inc.) must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 
 
 The following table reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding citations and orders issued to contractors. The proposed assessments as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 were taken from the MSHA Mine Data Retrieval System. Section references below are to sections of the Mine Act.
