st a t e ments: the Company s ability to
maintain and expand its revenue streams to compensate for the lower demand for the Company s digital cinema products and installation
services; potential interruptions of supplier relationships or higher prices charged by suppliers; the Company s ability to successfully
compete and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance and that keep pace with technological developments;
the Company s ability to successfully execute its capital allocation strategy or achieve the returns it expects from these holdings;
the Company s ability to maintain its brand and reputation and retain or replace its significant customers; challenges associated
with the Company s long sales cycles; the impact of a challenging global economic environment or a downturn in the markets; the
effects of economic, public health, and political conditions that impact business and consumer confidence and spending, including rising
interest rates, periods of heightened inflation and market instability, the outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious diseases,
such as COVID-19 and its variants or other health epidemics or pandemics, and armed conflicts, such as the ongoing military conflict
in Ukraine and related sanctions; economic and political risks of selling products in foreign countries (including tariffs); risks of
non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, potential sales tax collections and claims for uncollected amounts; cybersecurity
risks and risks of damage and interruptions of information technology systems; the Company s ability to retain key members of management
and successfully integrate new executives; the Company s ability to complete acquisitions, strategic investments, entry into new
lines of business, divestitures, mergers or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all; the impact of economic, public health
and political conditions on the companies in which the Company holds equity stakes; the Company s ability to utilize or assert
its intellectual property rights, the impact of natural disasters and other catastrophic events, whether natural, man-made, or otherwise
(such as the outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious diseases, or armed conflict); the adequacy of the Company s insurance;
the impact of having a controlling stockholder and vulnerability to fluctuation in the Company s stock price. 

Given
the risks and uncertainties, readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that the statements
are predictions of future results which may not occur as anticipated. Many of the risks listed above have been, and may further be, exacerbated
by the impact of economic, public health (such as a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic) and political conditions (such as the military
conflict in Ukraine) that impact consumer confidence and spending, particularly in the cinema, entertainment, and other industries in
which the Company and the companies in which the Company holds an equity stake operate, and the worsening economic environment. Actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks
and uncertainties described herein, as well as others not now anticipated. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible
for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such factors on our business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Except where required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes
in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements.

COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant impact to consumer behaviors and our customers, particularly our customers 
ability and willingness to purchase our products and services. A significant number of our customers temporarily ceased operations at
times during the height of the pandemic and continued to operate under COVID-19 restrictions for portions of 2022. As such, we have experienced,
and may continue to experience an impact on our results of operations. We believe that consumer reticence to engage in outside-the-home
activities, caused by the risk of contracting COVID-19, is abating, and our customers have resumed more typical, pre-COVID-19 purchasing
behaviors. There can be no assurances, however, that there will be no further resurgence or variants of COVID-19 which could reverse
the current trend .

Entertainment
Industry Trends and Positioning 

We
believe that the following trends positively impact our outlook for the entertainment industry: 

Post-COVID-19
 Recovery We believe there is pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment that will drive favorable trends post-COVID-19
 in the cinema exhibition and theme park industries. For example: 

Avatar:
 The Way of Water ranks in the top 10 of highest grossing films globally of all time 

Domestic
 box office gross receipts during 2022 increased approximately 64 over 2021 

The
 Batman was IMAX s largest March opening since 2019 

Spider-man
 ranks #3 of top grossing films domestically of all time 

Spider-man
 delivered Cinemark s biggest opening night of all time 

3 

Blockbuster
 Studio Releases According to the Hollywood Reporter, Box Office Rebound: Exhibitor Carnage Is in the
 Past, the pace of Hollywood blockbuster movies scheduled for release to cinemas is poised to accelerate and is already
 creating stronger-than-expected demand trends. According to CNBC, 2023 is expected to have a much stronger slate of films than 2022,
 both in terms of number of films and diversity of content. These factors, along with the return of exclusive theatrical releases,
 is encouraging industry analysts who are predicting movie theaters to rebound to near pre-pandemic levels by 2023. 

Increasing
 Trend of Outsourcing in the Cinema Industry We believe that cinema operators are increasing their use of outsourced
 services as they seek to reduce internal operating costs and maintain operational flexibility post-COVID-19. 

Upgrade
 Cycle from Xenon to Laser Projection We believe the transition from xenon projection to laser protection in the cinema
 exhibition industry will accelerate and continue over the next decade. Several exhibitors have publicly discussed plans to upgrade
 to an all-laser projection strategy, notably Cinemark and IMAX, to further improve the quality of the theatrical experience. In addition,
 in April 2022, AMC announced an agreement with Cinionic, Inc. to install Barco laser projectors in 3,500 of its U.S. auditoriums
 through 2026. We expect this upgrade cycle to drive increased demand for screen replacement as well as for our services to de-install,
 install and upgrade new and existing projection equipment. 

Consolidating
 Industry The cinema exhibition industry was consolidating via mergers and acquisitions pre-COVID-19. We expect consolidation
 of the supplier side of the cinema exhibition industry to accelerate post-COVID-19. 

Growing
 Demand for Content and Acceleration of New Streaming Services The global entertainment business continues to grow
 and evolve, with the following factors contributing to increasingly favorable environment for content: 

Spending
 for new content continues to rise In 2022, the top nine streaming giants spent 140.5 billion on content, and with a
 projected 10 annual increase, they are expected to increase that spend to a combined 172 billion by 2025. 
 
 Global
 subscribers to streaming services is up Since 2019, the number of global customers subscribing to streaming video platforms
 has grown from 642 million to more than 1.1 billion, a 71 leap. Over the next few years, this rise is expected to continue to 1.6
 billion in 2025. 
 
 Spending
 in Indie content continues to surge As much as Netflix and the five major Hollywood Studios spend producing their own
 content, independently made and acquired content accounts for twice as much money globally. The independent market grew 21.4 in
 2022, increasing to approximately 69 billion in 2022. 

We
believe the following strength and attributes position Strong Global Entertainment for accelerating growth: 

Par t nerships
 with Industry Leaders We believe our reputation for superior quality and customer service have made us the go-to
 screen provider for many of the leading operators in the industry. We provide projection screens and managed services to all of the
 top cinema operators in North America, including AMC, IMAX, Cinemark, Regal and many other regional cinema operators. We believe
 that we provide a majority of the large format projection screens used by the major operators in North America, including exclusive
 supply contracts with AMC and Cinemark, and we believe we also supply IMAX with substantially all of its projection screens globally.
 There is greater pressure on theaters to differentiate their experience from the at-home experience. We believe the global trend
 for premium entertainment plays to Strong Global Entertainment s strengths. The table below includes the top cinema companies
 in North America, all of which are our customers:

Innovator
 in the Industry We are constantly innovating as exemplified by our new, rapidly growing Eclipse curvilinear screen
 division which specially designs screens with proprietary coatings for maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive
 projection environments. Recently our screens were used in the much publicized Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience exhibit that wowed
 audiences with its all-encompassing experience of art, light, sound, movement and imagination. We also recently collaborated with
 Illuminarium Intermediate (Cayman), LLC in Atlanta, Georgia and plan to assist them in other cities as they expand their sensory
 cinema business. Eclipse screens are also used in theme parks and military simulation applications. 

Turn-Key,
 Vertically Integrated Partner We offer a comprehensive turn-key solution for our customers, offering projection and
 audio equipment, projection screen systems, as well as installation, break/fix on demand and outsourced managed services providing
 customers with a one-stop shop for their needs. 

World-Class
 and Scalable Manufacturing and Research Development R D We manufacture our screens in an
 approximately 80,000 square-foot facility in Joliette, Quebec, Canada (the Joliette Plant that we plan to lease on
 a long term basis from Strong/MDI (as defined below). The Joliette Plant is unique with two 90-foot-high screen coating towers which
 allows us to produce and finish large screens to precise specifications. The Joliette Plant also includes polyvinyl chloride PVC welding operations with programmable automations and areas dedicated to the manufacture of our paints and coatings used on all our
 screens, as well as dedicated in-house chemists and R D capabilities. We believe that our quality control procedures, in-house
 paint and coating capabilities and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture contribute significantly to our reputation
 for high performance and reliability.

Geopolitical
conditions, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our
control could adversely affect us. 

Geopolitical
conditions, military conflicts (including Russia s invasion of Ukraine), acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics
(including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition, or prospects. For example, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, and political, financial, or military
actions taken in response could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an
intermediary within the financial system. In addition, nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly
use cyberattacks against financial systems and financial-services companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries
with influence or interests at stake. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees,
or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident,
or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well
as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.

The
most notable impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations was the significant impact to our customers, specifically those in the entertainment
and advertising industries, and their ability and willingness to purchase our products and services. A significant number of our customers
temporarily ceased operations during the pandemic. For instance, many movie theaters and other entertainment centers were forced to close
or curtail their hours and, correspondingly, terminated or deferred their non-essential capital expenditures. The COVID-19 pandemic also
adversely affected film production and the pipeline of feature films available in the short- and long-term. We were also required to
temporarily close our screen manufacturing facility in Canada due to the governmental response to COVID-19, experienced lower revenues
from field services, and saw a reduction in non-recurring time and materials-based services. The impact of any future outbreak of contagious
disease, or a worsening or resurgence of COVID-19, is not readily ascertainable, is uncertain and cannot be predicted, but could have
an adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
the case of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, security risks as well as increases in fuel and other commodity costs, supply-chain disruptions,
and associated inflationary pressures have impacted our business the most. 

We
may also experience one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and
financial condition: adverse effects on our strategic partners businesses or on the businesses of companies in which we hold equity
stakes; impairment charges; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; and business
continuity concerns for us, our customers and our third-party vendors. 

These
conditions and events and others like them are highly complex and inherently uncertain, and their effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition, and prospects in the future cannot be reliably predicted.

While
the current impacts of COVID-19 are reflected in our results of operations, we cannot at this time separate the direct COVID-19 impacts
from other factors that cause our performance to vary from quarter to quarter. The ultimate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments and the related length
of their impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides,
we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its national and global economic impact. Our results of
operations in future periods may continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on global economic
conditions. For additional risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the discuss ion in

during 2022 .

Revenue
from Strong Entertainment increased 54.0 to 39.9 million in 2022 from 25.9 million in 2021. The increase from the prior year was due
to a 10.5 million increase in product revenue and a 3.5 million increase in service revenue. 

Demand
and revenue from products and services benefited from the continuing recovery in the cinema industry. With COVID-19 restrictions subsiding,
studio releases increasing and box office performance improving over the past year, cinema exhibitors are allocating more resources to
improving their auditoriums, including upgrading their auditoriums from xenon projection to laser projection, which helps drive demand
for our products and services. We have also increased the scope of our services to better support our customers and to increase market
share in cinema services. We expect the upgrades from xenon to laser to continue for at least the next several years. 

Strong
Studios commenced operations during 2022 and generated 0.9 million of revenue related to production services rendered to a project that
was completed during the fourth quarter of 2022. 

The
increase in other revenue primarily related to growth in our Digital Ignition business. We also recognized revenue of 0.7 million and
 0.8 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the support services provided to Firefly. The revenue generated from
services provided to Firefly are not expected to continue in future periods.

profit in the Strong Entertainment segment was 9.5 million or 23.9 of revenues for 2022 compared to 7.3 million or 28.1 of revenues

impact of the employee retention credit, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have been 23.2 of revenue. 

Gross
profit from product sales was 7.4 million or 24.5 of revenues for 2022 compared to 4.8 million or 24.4 of revenues for 2021. The
decrease in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from product mix as revenue from projection and audio equipment grew at a
faster rate than our higher margin screen products and services. Costs of labor, materials, packaging and shipping also increased,
partially offsetting the favorable impact of higher revenue levels. 

Gross
profit from service revenue was 2.1 million or 22.1 of revenues for 2022 compared to 2.5 million or 39.4 of revenues during 2021. Excluding the impact of the employee retention credits, gross profit from service revenue for 2021 would have been

The
Strong Entertainment segment generated income from operations of 2.8 million in 2022 compared to 2.2 million in 2021. The increase
in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenue and gross profit discussed above, which was partially offset by the
favorable impact on the prior year period of 1.3 million of employee retention credits which did not recur in the current period. In
addition, there were also increases to selling and administrative expenses due to higher compensation and benefits, marketing and travel
and entertainment expenses related to the increased revenue and business activity, including the startup of Strong Studios, in the current
period as compared to the prior year. 

During 2022, we recorded a 0.5 million loss on disposal of assets
within our Other operating segment related to the digital taxi tops that were made available to Firefly through December 31, 2022. The
non-cash charge of 0.5 million represented the write-off of the net book value of the digital taxi at the end of the agreement with Firefly. 

Unallocated
administrative expenses decreased to 4.4 million in 2022 compared to 4.6 million in 2021. Compensation and benefits expenses, including
stock-based compensation expense, decreased in the current period as compared to prior year but were partially offset by the recognition
of employee retention credits of 0.3 million recognized in the prior year.

L i quidity
 a n d Capital R e s our c es 

During
the past several years, we have primarily met our working capital and capital resource needs from our operating cash flows, sales of
our common stock and credit facilities. Our primary cash requirements involve operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures,
equity holdings, and other general corporate activities. 

We
ended 2022 with total cash and cash equivalents of 3.8 million compared to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 8.9 million
as of December 31, 2021. Of the 3.8 million as of December 31, 2022, 0.7 million was held by our Canadian subsidiary, Strong/MDI. Strong/MDI
makes intercompany loans to the U.S. parent company which do not trigger Canadian withholding taxes if they meet certain requirements.
As of December 31, 2022, the parent company had outstanding intercompany loans from Strong/MDI of approximately 38.6 million. In the
event those loans are not repaid, or are recharacterized as dividends to the U.S. parent company, we would be required to pay 5 Canadian
withholding taxes, which have been fully accrued as of December 31, 2022. 

In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related closures of cinemas, theme parks and entertainment venues, we took decisive actions to
conserve cash, reduce operating expenditures, delay capital expenditures, and manage working capital. 

On
June 7, 2021, Strong/MDI entered into a demand credit agreement (the 2021 Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated
the demand credit agreement dated as of September 5, 2017. The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of a revolving line of credit for up to
CDN 2.0 million subject to a borrowing base requirement, a 20-year installment loan for up to CDN 5.1 million and a 5-year installment
loan for up to CDN 0.5 million. These borrowings are due on demand by the lender and totaled 2.5 million as of December 31, 2022. In
January 2023, Strong/MDI entered into a demand credit agreement (the 2023 Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated
the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement consists of a revolving line of credit for up to CAD 5.0 million and a 20-year installment
loan for up to CAD 3.1 million. Under the 2023 Credit Agreement: (i) the amount outstanding under the line of credit is payable on demand
and bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus 1.0 and (ii) the amount outstanding under the installment loan
bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus 0.5 and is payable in monthly installments, including interest, over their respective
borrowing periods. The lender may also demand repayment of the installment loan at any time. The 2023 Credit Agreement is secured by
a lien on Strong/MDI s Quebec, Canada facility and substantially all of Strong/MDI s assets. The 2023 Credit Agreement requires
Strong/MDI to maintain a ratio of liabilities to effective equity (tangible stockholders equity, less amounts receivable
from affiliates and equity holdings) not exceeding 2.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1 times earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. 

We
believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow, credit facilities, equity holdings,
receivables and other assets will be sufficient to meet our projected capital needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our
ability to continue to meet our cash requirements will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenues
and cash flow from operations, performance of our equity holdings, our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully, any
new COVID-19 related restrictions or other unforeseen disruptions of cinemas, theme parks and other entertainment venues, and the continued
availability of financing, if needed. We cannot provide any assurance that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements
will remain accurate due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the event of a sustained market deterioration or
declines in net sales or other events, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and
take appropriate actions. We may, depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions for capital raises, the trading price
of our common stock and opportunities for uses of any proceeds, engage in additional public or private offerings of equity or debt securities
to increase our capital resources. However, financial and economic conditions could limit our access to credit and impair our ability
to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional
sources of financing or liquidity on acceptable terms, or at all. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a description
of our debt as of December 31, 2022.

Film
and Television Programming Rights 

Commencing
in March 2022, we began producing original productions and acquiring rights to films and television programming. Film and television
programming rights include the unamortized costs of in-process or in-development content produced or acquired by us. Our capitalized
costs include all direct production and financing costs, capitalized interest when applicable, and production overhead. Film and television
program rights are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology
with assumptions for cash flows. Key inputs employed in the discounted cash flow methodology include estimates of ultimate revenue (as
defined below) and costs, as well as a discount rate. The discount rate utilized in the valuation is based on the weighted average cost
of capital of the Company plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with acquiring the film and television programming rights. 

The
costs of producing content are amortized using the individual-film-forecast method. These costs are amortized based on the ratio of the
current period s revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned Ultimate Revenue as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. Management s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate
Revenue and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each film or television program. Amortization is adjusted when necessary
to reflect increases or decreases in forecasted Ultimate Revenues. 

For
an episodic television series, the period over which Ultimate Revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery
of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For films,
Ultimate Revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release. 

Content
assets are expected to be predominantly monetized individually and therefore are reviewed at the individual level when an event or change
in circumstance indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or the fair value may be less than the unamortized cost. 

Due
to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of Ultimate Revenues and expenses, these estimates may differ from actual
results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles will be more successful or less successful than anticipated.
Management regularly reviews and revises, when necessary, its Ultimate Revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the
rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs
of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. An increase in the estimate of Ultimate Revenue will generally result
in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate
of Ultimate Revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization
expense, and also periodically result in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title s fair value. We have
not yet incurred any of these write-downs. 

An
impairment charge would be recorded in the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed the estimated fair value. Estimates of future
revenue involve measurement uncertainties and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of film library costs may
be required because of changes in management s future revenue estimates.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FG Group Holdings Inc. (formerly, Ballantyne Strong, Inc.) (the
 Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)
income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the
 consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Accounting
for Equity Investments 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

The
Company s equity investments comprise a significant portion of its total assets as of December 31, 2022, and management uses several
methods of accounting to determine the appropriate accounting for each of its holdings based on management s evaluation of current
facts and circumstances. Significant judgment is required to determine if or when the Company has significant influence, or a controlling
interest, with respect to an investee. Also, it is inherently difficult to assess the financial position, financial performance and valuation
of entities that are privately held. 

Our
assessment of management s determination of the appropriate accounting method and resulting valuations for the Company s
equity investments is significant to our audit because equity investments are material to the consolidated financial statements and management s
assessment process involves significant judgment. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal audit procedures related to the Company s equity investments included the following: 

We
 obtained an understanding of management s significant accounting policies related to equity investments, and we evaluated such
 policies for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We
 corroborated the existence of each of the Company s equity investments as of December 31, 2022, and evaluated management s
 determination of the appropriate accounting method for each investee (i.e., fair value, equity method, cost plus) based on current
 facts and circumstances. 

Tested
 management s application of the accounting method to each investee, as well as management s assessment of potential impairment
 to determine the accuracy of year-end balances. 

For
 material purchases, exchanges or disposition of equity securities, we performed the following procedures: 

Examined
 source documents corroborating the transactions, including agreements, disbursement records, brokerage statements and bank statements. 

Recalculated
 any related gains and losses. 

Assessed
 the impact of the transaction on the accounting method used by management to account for the equity investment. 

For
 each applicable investment, reviewed management s consideration of the applicability of variable interest entity guidance.

maintenance and monitoring services 

The
Company sells service contracts that provide maintenance and monitoring services to its Strong Entertainment customers. These contracts
are generally 12 months in length. Revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. 

In
addition to selling service contracts, the Company also performs discrete time and materials-based maintenance and repair work for customers
in the Strong Entertainment segment. Revenue related to time and materials-based maintenance and repair work is recognized at the point
in time when the performance obligation has been fully satisfied. 

Installation
services 

The
Company performs installation services for its Strong Entertainment customers and recognizes revenue upon completion of the installations. 

Extended
warranty sales 

The
Company sells extended warranties to its Strong Entertainment customers. Typically, the Company is the primary obligor, and revenue is
recognized on a gross basis ratably over the term of the extended warranty.

Content
assets are expected to be predominantly monetized individually and therefore are reviewed at the individual level when an event or change
in circumstance indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or the fair value may be less than the unamortized cost. 

Due
to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of Ultimate Revenues and expenses, these estimates may differ from actual
results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles will be more successful or less successful than anticipated.
Management regularly reviews and revises, when necessary, its Ultimate Revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the
rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs
of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. An increase in the estimate of Ultimate Revenue will generally result
in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate
of Ultimate Revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization
expense, and also periodically result in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title s fair value. The Company
has not incurred any of these write-downs. 

An
impairment charge would be recorded in the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed the estimated fair value. Estimates of future
revenue involve measurement uncertainties and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of capitalized costs may
be required because of changes in management s future revenue estimates. 

years for buildings and improvements, for leasehold improvements, to years for machinery and equipment, years for furniture and fixtures and 3
years for computers and accessories. The Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation for income tax purposes. The Company
reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. The recoverability of property, plant and equipment is based on management s estimates of future undiscounted
cash flows and these estimates may vary due to a number of factors, some of which may be outside of management s control. To the
extent that the Company is unable to achieve management s forecasts of future income, it may become necessary to record impairment
losses for any excess of the net book value of property, plant and equipment over their fair value. 

The
Company incurs maintenance costs on all of its major equipment. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

instruments. Based on a combination of the cash on hand as well as quoted market prices of the securities held by FGF Holdings (as defined
below), the liquidation value of the Company s equity method holding was million at December 31, 2022 (see Note 7).

In

December 31, 2021, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share as

Note ). Per the terms of the SageNet Promissory Note, the Company would receive twelve consecutive equal quarterly payments of
principal, plus accrued interest thereon, commencing on March 31, 2022. The Company has elected to record the SageNet Promissory Note
using its historical cost basis. Additionally, a portion of the Purchase Price was placed in escrow by SageNet, the release of which
is contingent upon certain events and conditions specified in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Price is also subject to adjustment
based on closing working capital of Convergent. As additional consideration, SageNet also assumed approximately million of third-party
debt of Convergent, bringing the total enterprise value for Convergent s equity interests to approximately million. The Company
recorded a gain of million during the first quarter of 2021 related to the sale of Convergent. In January 2022, the Company entered
into an amendment to the SageNet Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the Company received a prepayment of million
plus accrued interest. As a result of the prepayment, all terms of the SageNet Promissory Note have been satisfied.

of the FGF Holdings operating agreement. 

The
Company has the ability to significantly influence FGF Holdings through its 
voting power but does not maintain a controlling interest. Accordingly, the Company applied the equity method of accounting to its
interest in FGF Holdings. The Company accounted for the transfer of the 
million shares of FGF common stock to FGF Holdings as a change in interest and recognized a gain of 
million during the third quarter of 2022, which was included in the equity method holding income on the consolidated
statements of operations. 

The
Company is able to determine the value of its equity method holding in FGF Holdings using the quoted market prices of FGF common and
preferred shares. Accordingly, the Company no longer needs to elect to recognize the results of its equity method holding in FGF Holdings
in its statement of operations on a one-quarter lag. 

Based
on quoted market prices of the assets held by FGF Holdings, as well as the liabilities and cash balance on hand, the liquidation
value of the Company s LLC interest in FGF Holdings was approximately 
million as of December 31, 2022. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company s retained earnings included an accumulated deficit from its equity method holdings of approximately
 million.

and lumber production. In April 2021, GreenFirst announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which it
would acquire a portfolio of forest and paper product assets (the GreenFirst Acquisition ). . As a result, the Company is no longer able to exercise significant influence
over GreenFirst and the equity holding in GreenFirst no longer qualifies for equity method accounting. As a result of applying the fair
value method of accounting, the Company recorded a loss on equity holdings of approximately million during 2022, of which million
was an unrealized loss and million was a realized loss. During 2021, a gain on equity holdings of million, of which

On
March 3, 2022, Strong Studios acquired, from Landmark Studio Group LLC Landmark ), the rights to original feature films
and television series, and has been assigned third party rights to content for global multiplatform distribution. The transaction entailed
the acquisition of certain projects which are in varying stages of development, none of which have, as yet, produced revenue. In connection
with such assignment and purchase, Strong Studios agreed to pay to Landmark approximately 
 million in four separate payments, 
 million of which was paid upon the closing of
the transaction. The 
 million acquisition price was allocated to three
projects in development, including 
 million to Safehaven , 
 million to Flagrant and 
 million to Shadows in the Vineyard . The
Company also agreed to issue to Landmark no later than 10 days after the completion of the initial public offering of Strong Global Entertainment,
a warrant to purchase up to 
 common shares of Strong Global Entertainment,
exercisable for three years beginning six months after the consummation of the initial public offering, at an exercise price equal to
the per-share offering price of Strong Global Entertainment s common shares in the initial public offering (the Landmark
Warrant ). The Landmark Warrant allows for cashless exercise in certain limited circumstances and provides for certain registration
rights for such warrant shares. In the event that an initial public offering of the Company does not occur within a specified time, Landmark
would have the right to surrender the warrant in exchange for 
ownership in Strong Studios. 

As
a condition precedent to entry into the AA Agreement, Strong Studios agreed to enter into distribution agreements for the AA Projects
(the AA Distribution Agreements with Screen Media Ventures, LLC SMV ). Pursuant to the AA Distribution Agreements,
SMV agreed to purchase the global distribution rights to Safehaven for million and Flagrant for million upon
delivery of each project. In January 2023, Strong Studios amended its agreement with SMV resulting in Strong Studios retaining the worldwide
global distribution rights for the Flagrant series and releasing SMV from the obligation to purchase the distribution rights for
the series. 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 926 Entertainment - Films, costs of acquiring and producing films
and television programs are capitalized when incurred. In connection with the transaction, and using the guidance in Acquisition
of Assets Rather than a Business subsections contained within ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company allocated the million
acquisition price to the various projects under development based upon the historical costs incurred by Landmark, which the Company believes
approximates fair value. The Company also recorded a liability for the million of remaining installment payments it will make to
Landmark. Finally, the Company also determined the fair value of the Landmark Warrant and allocated an additional million to the
various projects under development. The Company will recognize the remaining payment contingencies that may be due to Landmark, which
include distribution fees and profit participations that will be incurred following the completion and exploitation of each project,
when the contingencies are resolved, and the amounts become payable.

During
the second quarter of 2022, Safehaven 2022, Inc. Safehaven 2022 was established to manage the production and financing
of Safehaven , one of the projects acquired from Landmark. Strong Studios owns of Safehaven 2022 and the remaining is owned
by Unbounded Services, LLC Unbounded ). No consideration was paid by Strong Studios in exchange for its equity interest
in Safehaven 2022. Unbounded also did not contribute any assets or liabilities to Safehaven 2022 and agreed to provide day-to-day management
services in exchange for their ownership. Unbounded will also serve as a co-producer on the project. Strong Studios assigned the
Landmark distribution agreement to Safehaven 2022, and the Landmark distribution agreement serves as collateral for the production financing
at Safehaven 2022. Strong Studios and Unbounded will share profits and losses, if any, from Safehaven 2022 on a pro-rata basis based
on their relative ownership percentages. 

Strong
Studios allocated 
million of the 
million acquisition price to Safehaven and incurred an additional 
million of development costs during 2022. Strong Studios transferred the 
million in intellectual property representing the rights and assets related to Safehaven and Safehaven 2022 agreed to
reimburse Strong Studios 
million for those costs following payment of any senior secured debt and prior to any profit participations or equity distributions.
Safehaven 2022 reimbursed the million of development costs incurred by Strong Studios, and the remaining 
million payable to Strong Studios represents an obligation of Safehaven 2022 to Strong Studios and is not contingent on any specific
event. Accordingly, the Company has classified the amount due from Safehaven 2022 as a receivable within other current assets on its
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Strong Studios expects Safehaven 2022 to reimburse the acquisition cost
allocated to the project based on its ultimate expected revenues and profits from the exploitation of the project. Safehaven 2022
will begin to generate revenue and expenses upon delivery of the completed Safehaven series to SMV, which is expected to
occur in mid-2023. . Upon delivery and acceptance, Safehaven 2022 expects to
recognize 
million in initial revenue from the distribution rights and will record cost of sales using the individual-film-forecast method
based on the ratio of the current period s revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be
earned. Safehaven 2022 is an equity method holding and the Company will reflect its proportionate share of the net periodic profit
and loss of Safehaven 2022 as equity method income (loss) during each reporting period. 

Safehaven
2022 entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of Hope to provide interim production financing for the Safehaven
 production, secured by the Landmark distribution agreement. Safehaven 2022 is the sole borrower and guarantor under the loan agreement.
As of December 31, 2022, Safehaven 2022 had borrowed million under the facility for production costs incurred to that date. Safehaven
2022 has also received working capital advances of million from Strong Studios. Strong Studios expects Safehaven 2022 to reimburse
the working capital advances in the second half of 2023. 

Strong
Studios reviewed its ownership in Safehaven 2022 and concluded that it has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, in
Safehaven 2022 based on its ownership being less than 50 along with having one of three representatives on the board of managers of
Safehaven 2022. Strong Studios also reviewed whether it otherwise had the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of Safehaven 2022 and concluded that it did not control the entity and is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company
will apply the equity method of accounting to its equity holding in Safehaven 2022 and will record its proportionate share of the net
income/loss resulting from the equity holding as a single line item captioned equity method holding income (loss) on its
statement of operations. 

Safehaven
2022 did not record any income or expense during 2022 because all costs incurred by Safehaven 2022 were related to the in-process production
and have been capitalized. Upon delivery and acceptance of the project, Safehaven 2022 expects to recognize revenue from the distribution
rights and will record cost of sales using the individual-film-forecast method based on the ratio of the current period s revenues
to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned. A summary of the balance sheet of Safehaven 2022 as of December

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold its Convergent business segment. See Note 3 for additional details. The tax expense/benefit
for these business segments have been allocated to discontinued operations; however, the Company has sufficient net operating losses
to offset taxable income/loss from these discontinued operations, all of which is offset by a valuation allowance. 

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A cumulative loss in a particular jurisdiction in recent years is a significant
piece of evidence with respect to the realizability that is difficult to overcome. Based on the available objective evidence including
recent updates to the taxing jurisdictions generating income, the Company concluded that a valuation allowance of million and 
million should be recorded against the Company s U.S. tax jurisdiction deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The overall change in valuation allowance was a reduction of million; however some changes in valuation allowance were allocated
to discontinued operations. The effective tax rate above relates only to continuing operations. 

The
Company recorded a deferred tax liability related to withholding tax on the repatriation of earnings from its Canadian subsidiary of
 million as of both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

A
provision of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Tax Act was the implementation of the Global Intangible-Low Taxed
Income Tax, or GILTI. The Company has elected to account for the impact of GILTI in the period in which the tax actually
applies to the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not incur any additional taxable income as a result
of this provision. The Company is electing the GILTI High Tax Exclusion. 

The
Company s gross net operating loss carryforwards for Federal tax purposes total approximately million and million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, for Federal losses generated through December
31, 2017. Though the Company incurred a taxable loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, gross net operating loss carryforwards decreased
due to the sale of Convergent. The Federal and state losses previously allocated to Convergent are no longer available to the Company
to offset future taxable income. Therefore, the related deferred tax asset and offsetting valuation allowance has been removed. As a
result of the 2017 Tax Act, all Federal net operating losses that are generated beginning January 1, 2018 and beyond will carryforward
indefinitely. The Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million as of December 31, 2022, that expire in
2024. Utilization of these losses may be limited in the event certain changes in ownership occur. 

In
March of 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was enacted and made significant changes to Federal tax laws, including
certain changes that were retroactive to the 2019 tax year. Changes in tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment and the
retroactive effects are recognized in these financial statements. There were no material income tax consequences of this enacted legislation
on the reporting period of these financial statements. 

. 

Estimated
amounts related to underpayment of income taxes, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of income tax expense
in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Amounts accrued for
estimated underpayment of income taxes were zero as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

During
the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company entered into a lease for a combined office and warehouse in Omaha, Nebraska. The Company incurred
total costs of approximately million to complete the build-out of the new combined office and warehouse facility. The landlord has
agreed to fund approximately of the build-out costs, and the Company is required to repay the portion funded by the landlord in equal
monthly installments through the end of the initial lease term in February 2027. Through the end of 2021, the Company incurred approximately

.
The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception or modification of a contract. A contract is or contains a lease
if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration. Control over
the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both (a) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the
use of the asset and (b) the right to direct the use of the asset. 

Right-of-use
assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement
date. Certain of the leases contain extension options; however, the Company has not included such options as part of its right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities because it does not expect to extend the leases. The Company measures and records a right-of-use asset and
lease liability based on the discount rate implicit in the lease, if known. In cases where the discount rate implicit in the lease is
not known, the Company measures the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using a discount rate equal to the Company s estimated
incremental borrowing rate for loans with similar collateral and duration. 

The
Company elected to not apply the recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, to leases
of all classes of underlying assets that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option
to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Instead, lease payments for such short-term leases
are recognized in operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation
for those payments is incurred. 

The
Company elected, as a lessee, for all classes of underlying assets, to not separate nonlease components from lease components and instead
to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.

In our experience, a large percentage of these types of claims have never been substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company has not suffered any adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims and intends to continue to defend these
lawsuits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a loss contingency reserve of approximately million, which represents the Company s
estimate of its potential losses related to the settlement of open cases. During 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, the Company settled
three cases, which resulted in payments totaling 53 thousand. When appropriate, the Company may settle additional claims in the future.
The Company does not expect the resolution of these cases to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

the time of his hiring as Senior Vice President of Finance of the Company, effective March 20, 2019. 

In
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, the economy, and the industry, each executive officer of the Company
agreed to four temporary reductions in the base salaries otherwise payable to the executive officers, which were expected to be temporary
until the Company resumes normal operations. On April 29, 2020, as approved by the Board on April 30, 2020, Messrs. Roberson and Boegner
agreed to a 60 reduction in each of their salaries, and Mr. Major agreed to a 25 reduction in his salary, which reductions were effective
from April 13, 2020, until June 30, 2020. On July 8, 2020, the Board approved, and Messrs. Roberson, Boegner and Major agreed to, a 25 
reduction in each of their salaries, which reductions were effective from July 1, 2020, until and including July 31, 2020. On August
17, 2020, as approved by the Board on August 18, 2020, Messrs. Roberson, Boegner and Major agreed to a 25 reduction in each of their
salaries, which reductions were effective from August 1, 2020, until and including August 31, 2020. On September 15, 2020, the Board
approved, and Messrs. Roberson, Boegner and Major agreed to, a 25 reduction in each of their salaries, which reductions were effective
from September 1, 2020, until and including September 30, 2020. 

Discretionary
Bonuses 

In
March 2021, the Compensation Committee approved the payment of performance bonuses to Messrs. Roberson and Major of 262,500 and 112,500,
respectively, for extra time and effort given by such employees in connection with the successful completion of the sale of our Convergent
operating business. No discretionary performance bonuses were awarded in 2022. 

Long-Term
Incentives 

We
use long-term incentive equity awards as a part of our executive compensation program, in order to incentivize and reward the
achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and align the financial interests of the Company s executive officers with
those of the Company s stockholders. The Company s long-term incentive program for its Named Executive Officers has
consisted of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and nonqualified stock options. Each such type of award, and the
reasons it is used, is described below. At the Company s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company s stockholders
approved the 2017 Plan (prior to its amendment and restatement) as the successor to our 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
 2010 Plan and 2014 Non-Employee Directors Restricted Stock Plan, and long-term incentive awards granted after
the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders have been made under the 2017 Plan. In addition, stockholders approved an amendment and
restatement of the 2017 Plan at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

Restricted
Stock Awards . Restricted stock awards represent the transfer of ownership of a certain number of shares of the Company s
common stock, subject to restrictions on transfer and a substantial risk of forfeiture based on the recipient s continued employment
by the Company during the applicable vesting period set out in the award agreement. Restricted stock awards are designed primarily to
encourage retention of executive officers and key employees. 

33 

Restricted
Stock Units . RSUs represent a right to receive a specific number of units at the end of the specified period. Each recipient
of RSUs has no rights as a stockholder through such RSUs during the restriction period of the RSUs. Settlement of an RSU award is made
in cash, shares of stock or some combination thereof, as specified in the applicable award agreement. RSUs are designed to provide retention
incentives to our executive officers and key employees. 

Nonqualified
Stock Options . Nonqualified stock options represent an option to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an option
price equal to the closing price on the NYSE American of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The stock options are designed
to motivate executives to increase stockholder value as the stock options will only have value if our stockholders also benefit from
increasing stock prices. 

2022
and 2021 Equity Grants 

The
Compensation Committee did not approve grants of stock options or RSUs to our Named Executive Officers during 2022 or 2021. 

401(k)
Retirement Plan 

The
Company s executive officers are able to participate in the Company s Retirement and Savings 401(k) Plan (the 401(k)
Plan ), which is a combination savings and profit-sharing plan designed to qualify under Section 401 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code. Participation in the 401(k) Plan is generally available to all FG Group Holdings employees on the same terms. Each participant
may defer up to 100 of his or her compensation. The Company may make a discretionary matching contribution equal to a uniform percentage
of salary. Each year the Company determines the amount of the discretionary percentage. In 2022 and 2021, the Company matched 50 of
the amount deferred up to 6 of each participating employee s contribution. Employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan are non-forfeitable.
Employer contributions vest annually over three years on the employee s employment anniversary. Benefits may be distributed to
participants or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, in the event of a participant s death, retirement or other termination
of service, or, if the participant so requests, on reaching age 59 . Participants may be eligible to withdraw benefits in case
of hardship. 

Contributions
to the 401(k) Plan made by the Company on behalf of the Named Executive Officers are included in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table. 

Employment
Agreements 

The
Company currently has written employment agreements with Messrs. Roberson, Major and Boegner. The material provisions of these employment
agreements are discussed below. 

Mr.
Roberson s employment agreement with the Company, which was entered into as of November 6, 2018, provides for a base salary, subject
to annual review and adjustment, and he is eligible for performance-based compensation in the form of an annual bonus targeted at 150,000,
payable partly in cash and partly through equity awards as determined by the Compensation Committee. The bonus will be subject to the
achievement of performance metrics and other criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Roberson is also eligible to participate
in the Company s 401(k), medical, dental and vision plans and certain other benefits available generally to employees of the Company.
The employment agreement also contains customary non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. If Mr. Roberson s employment is
terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Amendment), Mr. Roberson will be entitled to severance equal to one year of
his base salary payable over a period of twelve months following the termination date in accordance with the Company s regular
payroll practices and, if Mr. Roberson timely and properly elects continuation health coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 COBRA ), the Company will pay Mr. Roberson s COBRA premiums for a period of twelve months
following the termination date. 

Mr.
Major s employment agreement with the Company, which was entered into as of March 20, 2019, provides for a base salary, subject
to annual review and adjustment, and he is eligible for performance-based compensation in the form of an annual bonus targeted at 25 
of base salary, payable in a combination in cash and equity, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The bonus will be subject to
the achievement of performance metrics and other criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee. As a signing bonus, the Company
granted Mr. Major 30,000 RSUs (equal to 90,000 of common stock, as determined based on the trading price of the Company s common
stock on the date of grant) pursuant to the 2017 Plan, vesting over a period of three years from the date of grant. The Company also
paid a cash signing bonus of 30,000. Mr. Major is also eligible to participate in the Company s 401(k), medical, dental and vision
plans and certain other benefits available generally to employees of the Company. The employment agreement also contains customary non-competition
and non-solicitation covenants. Mr. Major is entitled to severance equal to one year of his base salary in the event of a change in control
that results in his termination or if the Senior Vice President of Finance position is eliminated without Mr. Major being offered a mutually-agreed
comparable opportunity at an affiliate of the Company. 

Mr.
Boegner s employment agreement with the Company, which was entered into on February 14, 2012, provides for a base salary, subject
to annual review and adjustment, and Mr. Boegner s eligibility to participate in and/or receive other benefits under compensation
plans provided to other executive employees of the Company. He is eligible for performance-based compensation in the form of an annual
bonus and is eligible to receive awards, in the Compensation Committee s discretion, under the Company s long-term incentive
plans. Pursuant to his employment agreement, in the event that his employment is terminated by FG Group Holdings without cause or by
Mr. Boegner for good reason, as these terms are defined in the agreement, then he will receive his base salary for a period equal to
three (3) weeks for each year that he was employed by the Company. On April 26, 2021, the Company amended Mr. Boegner s employment
agreement to limit this severance period to three (3) weeks for each year that he was employed by the Company up to and including October
2020. In addition, the Company will pay for, or reimburse Mr. Boegner for, the cost of health insurance during this same period. For
more information on the terms of Mr. Boegner s employment agreement, see Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in
Control Employment Agreements.

Potential
Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 

Employment
Agreements 

If
Mr. Roberson s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Amendment), Mr. Roberson will be entitled
to severance equal to one year of his base salary payable over a period of twelve months following the termination date in accordance
with the Company s regular payroll practices and, if Mr. Roberson timely and properly elects continuation health coverage pursuant
to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 COBRA ), the Company will pay Mr. Roberson s COBRA
premiums for a period of twelve months following the termination date 

Pursuant
to Mr. Major s employment agreement with the Company, in the event of a change in control that results in Mr. Major being terminated,
or if the Senior Vice President of Finance position is eliminated without Mr. Major being offered a mutually-agreed comparable opportunity
at an affiliate of the Company, Mr. Major will be entitled to severance equal to one year of his base salary. 

Pursuant
to Mr. Boegner s employment agreement with the Company, in the event Mr. Boegner s employment is terminated by the Company
without cause or by Mr. Boegner for good reason, then he will receive his base salary for a period equal to three (3) weeks for each
year that he has been employed by the Company and all existing insurance benefits shall remain in force until the last day of the month
in which the severance period expires, subject to Mr. Boegner s continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants set forth
in the employment agreement (including confidentiality and non-solicitation covenants) and his execution of the Company s standard
form of general release. On April 26, 2021, the Company amended Mr. Boegner s employment agreement to limit the severance period
to three (3) weeks for each year that he was employed by the Company up to and including October 2020. In addition, Mr. Boegner would
be entitled to receive any earned and unpaid amounts owed to him under the employment agreement and such other accrued benefits as may
be provided for under the agreement. For purposes of Mr. Boegner s employment agreement, good reason means a material
breach by the Company of its obligations to Mr. Boegner under the agreement. In addition, for purposes of the agreement, cause 
exists if Mr. Boegner (i) acted dishonestly or incompetently or engaged in willful misconduct in performance of his executive duties,
(ii) breached fiduciary duties owed to the Company, (iii) intentionally failed to perform reasonably assigned duties, (iv) willfully
violated any law, rule or regulation, or court order (other than minor traffic violations or similar offenses), or otherwise committed
any act which would have a material adverse impact on the business of the Company, and/or (v) is in breach of his obligations under the
agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the breach from the Company. We are also obligated
under Mr. Boegner s employment agreement to provide certain payments to Mr. Boegner in the event of his death or termination by
reason of his incapacity. In the event of Mr. Boegner s death, we are obligated to pay his estate all accrued sums due and owing
to Mr. Boegner with respect to his salary and such other benefits as may be provided under his agreement. In addition, in the event we
terminate Mr. Boegner s employment by reason of his incapacity, Mr. Boegner is entitled to any accrued amounts due and owing to
him with respect to his salary and such other benefits as may be provided under his agreement. 

2017
Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan Change in Control Provisions 

Our
2017 Plan, which was initially approved by our stockholders on June 15, 2017, with the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan, effective
as of October 28, 2019, approved by our stockholders on December 17, 2019, generally provides for double-trigger vesting
of equity awards in connection with a change in control of the Company, as described below. 

To
the extent that outstanding awards granted under the 2017 Plan are assumed in connection with a change in control, except as otherwise
provided in the applicable award agreement or in another written agreement with the participant, all outstanding awards will continue
to vest and become exercisable (as applicable) based on continued service during the remaining vesting period, with performance-based
awards being converted to service-based awards at the target level. Vesting and exercisability (as applicable) of awards
that are assumed in connection with a change in control generally would be accelerated in full on a double-trigger basis,
if, within two years after the change in control, the participant s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, or by
the participant for good reason. Any stock options or stock appreciation rights SARs that become vested
on a double-trigger basis generally would remain exercisable for the full duration of the term of the applicable award. 

37 

To
the extent outstanding awards granted under the 2017 Plan are not assumed in connection with a change in control, then such awards generally
would become vested in full on a single-trigger basis, effective immediately prior to the change in control, with performance-based
awards becoming vested at the target level. Any stock options or SARs that become vested on a single-trigger 
basis generally would remain exercisable for the full duration of the term of the applicable award. 

The
Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine whether or not any outstanding awards granted under the 2017 Plan will be assumed
by the resulting entity in connection with a change in control, and the Compensation Committee has the authority to make appropriate
adjustments in connection with the assumption of any awards. The Compensation Committee also has the right to cancel any outstanding
awards in connection with a change in control, in exchange for a payment in cash or other property (including shares of the resulting
entity) in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares subject to the award over any exercise price related
to the award, including the right to cancel any underwater stock options and SARs without payment therefor. 

For
purposes of the 2017 Plan, subject to the exceptions set forth in the 2017 Plan, a change in control generally includes
(a) the acquisition of more than 50 of the voting power or value of the Company s stock; (b) the incumbent board of directors
ceasing to constitute a majority of the board of directors during a twelve-month period; and (c) the acquisition of 50 or more of the
gross fair market value of the Company s assets over a twelve-month period. The full definition of change in control 
is set out in the 2017 Plan. 

For
purposes of the 2017 Plan, unless otherwise defined in a written agreement with the participant or an applicable severance plan, cause ,
as a reason for the Company s termination of a participant s employment, generally means that the participant (a) acted dishonestly
or incompetently or engaged in willful misconduct in performance of his or her duties; (b) breached fiduciary duties owed to the Company;
(c) intentionally failed to perform reasonably assigned duties, which the participant did not satisfactorily correct within 30 calendar
days following written notification; (d) was convicted or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere of any felony crime involving dishonesty;
or (e) otherwise committed any act which could have a material adverse impact on the business of the Company. 

For
purposes of the 2017 Plan, unless otherwise defined in a written agreement with the participant or an applicable severance plan, good
reason , as a reason for a participant s termination of his or her employment, generally means the occurrence of any of the
following without the participant s consent (and unless timely cured by the Company following notice from the participant): (a)
any material diminution in the participant s compensation or benefits, unless generally applicable to all similarly situated employees
of the Company; (b) the assignment to the participant of any duties inconsistent with, or substantially adverse to, his or her status
and duties, or a reduction in title; (c) a material breach by the Company or a subsidiary of its obligations under the participant s
employment agreement, if any; or (d) the relocation of the participant s primary work location to a location more than fifty miles
away from the current location. 

Except
as described above with respect to a change in control, unexercisable stock options, unvested restricted shares and unvested RSUs generally
become forfeited upon termination of employment. The stock options that are exercisable at the time of termination of employment expire
within the earlier of thirty days after such termination or the expiration date of the options. Upon termination for cause, 
all options, whether or not exercisable, are generally automatically forfeited. 

Awards
granted under the 2017 Plan may be subject to forfeiture or recoupment as determined by the Compensation Committee in the event of certain
detrimental activity, such as a participant s breach of applicable restrictive covenants. Awards granted under the 2017 Plan also
may be subject to forfeiture or recoupment as provided pursuant to any compensation recovery (or clawback policy that
the Company may adopt or maintain from time to time. 

2010
Long-Term Incentive Plan Change in Control Provisions 

The
2010 Plan provides that no acceleration of an award shall occur upon or after a change in control unless such acceleration
is provided for in the applicable award agreement and determined by the Compensation Committee on a grant-by-grant basis or as may be
provided in an after written agreement between the Company and the grantee. The award agreements for the stock options and restricted
shares granted to Messrs. Cerminara and Boegner under the 2010 Plan provide for accelerated vesting of all unvested options and restricted
shares upon the occurrence of a change in control while the grantee is employed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company
as of the date of the change in control. 

For
purposes of the 2010 Plan, subject to the exceptions set forth in the 2010 Plan, a change in control generally includes
(i) the acquisition of more than 50 of the Company s common stock; (ii) over a twelve-month period, the acquisition of more than
50 of the Company s common stock or the replacement of a majority of the board of directors by directors not endorsed by the persons
who were members of the board before the new directors appointment; and (iii) the acquisition of more than 50 of the total gross
fair market value of all the assets of the Company over a twelve-month period.

(2) On
 July 1, 2022, Mr. Cerminara was granted 20,833 RSUs under the 2017 Plan, and Messrs. Gerber,
 Lanktree, Mitchell, Roschman, Suh and Swets were each granted 16,666 RSUs under the 2017
 Plan. The RSUs vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, provided that, if the
 director makes himself available and consents to be nominated by the Company for continued
 service as a director of the Company, but is not nominated to the Board of Directors for
 election by stockholders, other than for good reason as determined by the Board of Directors
 in its discretion, then the RSUs will vest in full as of the director s last date of
 service as a director of the Company. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one
 share of common stock of the Company. The amounts shown in this column include the fair value
 of the annual RSU award on the date of grant, which was 2.40 per share. For additional information
 relating to the assumptions made in valuing and expensing these awards for 2022, refer to
 Note 13 in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 Messrs. Gerber, Lanktree, Roschman and Suh was 26,220. The aggregate number of unvested RSU
 awards outstanding as of December 31, 2022, for each of Messrs. Mitchell and Swets was 16,666.
 The aggregate number of unvested RSU awards outstanding as of December 31, 2022 for Mr. Cerminara
 was 30,387. 

On
March 31, 2021, we modified the compensation program for all non-employee directors which was effective for fiscal year 2021. The program
was adopted to remain competitive in attracting and retaining qualified Board members and to better align director compensation to other
public companies of comparable size to the Company. The terms of the new program are as follows: 

The
 Chairman of the Board of Directors is entitled to receive an annual cash retainer of 65,000,
 and each other non-employee director is entitled to receive an annual cash retainer of 40,000,
 paid in quarterly installments; 

The
 Chairman of the Audit Committee is entitled to receive an additional annual cash retainer
 of 10,000 and each other member of the Audit Committee is entitled to receive an additional
 cash retainer of 3,000, paid in quarterly installments; 

The
 Chairman of the Compensation Committee as well as the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate
 Governance Committee are each entitled to receive an additional cash retainer of 10,000,
 and each other member of the Compensation Committee as well as each other member of the Nominating
 and Corporate Governance Committee are entitled to receive and annual cash retainer of 3,000,
 paid in quarterly installments; 

40 

The
 Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an annual grant of RSUs with a value of 50,000,
 and each other non-employee director receives an annual grant of RSUs with a value of 40,000,
 vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, provided that, if the director makes
 himself available and consents to be nominated by the Company for continued service as a
 director of the Company, but is not nominated to the Board of Directors for election by stockholders,
 other than for good reason as determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion, then
 the RSUs will vest in full as of the director s last date of service as a director
 of the Company; and 

Each
 non-employee director receives reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for attending
 meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees. 

The
2017 Plan includes a limit on the amount of compensation payable to our non-employee directors. Specifically, the 2017 Plan provides
that the aggregate grant date fair value of all awards granted to any single non- employee director during any single calendar year (determined
as of the applicable grant date(s) under applicable financial accounting rules), when taken together with any cash fees paid to the non-employee
director during the same calendar year, may not exceed 200,000.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

RELATED
PERSON TRANSACTIONS 

The
Company s Audit Committee Charter requires the Audit Committee to review policies and procedures regarding transactions between
the Company and officers, directors and other related parties that are not a normal part of the Company s business. There are no
formal written policies or procedures used by Board of Directors or the Audit Committee to review, approve or ratify related party transactions.
Rather, the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee reviews all related party transactions on a case-by-case basis for potential conflict
of interest situations on an ongoing basis and uses its discretion in approving all such transactions. The Board of Directors or the
Audit Committee will apply the standards of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K when evaluating certain relationships and related transactions. 

On
an annual basis, the Company determines whether there are any related party transactions that need to be evaluated and approved by the
Board of Directors or the Audit Committee based on the responses received from each director and executive officer based on an annual
questionnaire completed by the director or executive officer. While there are no formal written policies or procedures used, the Board
of Directors or the Audit Committee may consider the following factors in evaluating related party transactions: 

the
 nature of the related person s interest in the transaction; 

the
 presence of standard prices, rates, charges or terms otherwise consistent with arms-length
 dealings with unrelated third parties; 

the
 materiality of the transaction to each party; 

the
 reasons for the Company entering into the transaction with the related person; 

the
 potential effect of the transaction on the status of a director as an independent, outside
 or disinterested director or committee member; and 

any
 other factors the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee may deem relevant. 

44 

The
arrangements discussed below were approved by the Audit Committee and/or the independent members of our Board of Directors. 

Indemnification
Agreements 

On
September 1, 2020, the Company entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers. Under the terms
of the indemnification agreements, subject to certain exceptions specified in the indemnification agreements, the Company will, among
other things, indemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by law in the event such director or executive
officer becomes subject to or a participant in certain claims or proceedings as a result of his service as a director or officer. The
Company will also, subject to certain exceptions and repayment conditions, advance to such director or executive officer specified indemnifiable
expenses incurred in connection with such claims or proceedings. 

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

The
Board of Directors is composed of a majority of independent directors as defined by the listing requirements of the NYSE American. The
Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Gerber, Lanktree, Mitchell, Roschman and Suh are independent directors of the Company
under the listing standards adopted by the NYSE American. In making these independence determinations, the Board of Directors considered
all of the factors that automatically compromise director independence as specified in the NYSE American s listing standards and
determined that none of those conditions existed. In addition, the Board of Directors considered whether any direct or indirect material
relationship, beyond those factors that automatically compromise director independence, existed between those directors, their immediate
family members, or their affiliated entities, on the one hand, and us and our subsidiaries, on the other hand. The Board of Directors
determined, for those directors identified as independent above, that any relationship that existed was not material and did not compromise
that director s independence. Our independent directors meet in an executive session at least once per year. All standing committee
members are independent for the purpose of the committees on which they serve.

DESCRIPTION
OF THE SECURITIES OF FG GROUP HOLDINGS INC. 

 REGISTERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

The
following summarizes the terms and provisions of the securities of FG Group Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company ).
The common stock of the Company is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). The following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company s
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended, which the Company has previously filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and applicable Nevada law. 

Authorized
Capital 

The
Company s authorized capital stock consists of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Common
Stock ), and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share (the Preferred Stock ). 

Under
Nevada law, stockholders generally are not personally liable for a corporation s acts or debts. 

Exchange
and Trading Symbol 

The
Common Stock is listed for trading on the NYSE American under the trading symbol FGH. 

Rights
and Preferences 

All
outstanding shares of Common Stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. Holders of shares of Common Stock have no conversion,
preemptive or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. The rights,
preferences and privileges of the holders of Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders
of shares of any series of Preferred Stock that the Company may designate and issue in the future. 

In
the event of the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in
the assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of the Company s known debts and liabilities
and after adequate provision has been made for each class of stock having preference over the Common Stock, if any. 

Voting
Rights 

Holders
of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. There is no
cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of
Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law, all other matters brought to a vote of the holders of Common Stock are determined
by a majority of the votes cast and, except as may be provided with respect to any other outstanding class or series of the Company s
stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock possess the exclusive voting power. 

Dividends 

Subject
to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to
receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors out of legally available funds. 

Preferred
Stock 

The
Board of Directors of the Company is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by applicable law and without further approval
or action by the holders of Common Stock, to issue shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series. The Board of Directors may fix the
designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms. The
Company has no outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. 

The
rights of the holders of Common Stock will generally be subject to the prior rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock with respect to dividends, liquidation preferences and other matters. 

Anti-Takeover
Effects of Provisions of Nevada Law and the Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 

Nevada
Law 

Nevada
Business Combination Statute . The business combination provisions of Sections 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive, of the Nevada
Revised Statutes generally prohibit a Nevada corporation with at least 200 stockholders of record from engaging in various business
combination transactions with any interested stockholder for a period of two years after the date that the person first become
an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder
is approved by the corporation s board of directors before the person first became an interested stockholder, or the business combination
is approved by the board of directors and thereafter is approved at a meeting of the corporation s stockholders by the affirmative
vote of at least 60 of the outstanding voting power of the corporation held by disinterested stockholders. 

Following
the expiration of the two-year period, the corporation is prohibited from engaging in a business combination transaction
with the interested stockholder, unless: 

the
 business combination or the transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder
 is approved by the corporation s board of directors before the person first became
 an interested stockholder; 

the
 business combination is approved by a majority of the outstanding voting power of the corporation
 held by disinterested stockholders; or 

the
 aggregate amount of the consideration to be received in the business combination by all of
 the holders of outstanding common shares of the corporation not beneficially owned by the
 interested stockholder is at least equal to the higher of: (a) the highest price per share
 paid by the interested stockholder for any common shares acquired by the interested stockholder
 within two years immediately before the date of the announcement of the business combination
 or within two years immediately before, or in the transaction in which the person became
 an interested stockholder, whichever is higher, and (b) the market value per common share
 on the date of the announcement of the business combination or on the date that the person
 first became an interested stockholder, whichever is higher. 

In
general, an interested stockholder is any person who is (i) the direct or indirect beneficial owner of 10 or more of the
voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time
within two years immediately before the date in question was the direct or indirect beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power
of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. 

A
 combination is generally defined to include mergers or consolidations or any sale, lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer,
or other disposition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, with an interested stockholder: (a) having an aggregate market
value equal to more than five percent of the aggregate market value of the consolidated assets of the corporation, (b) having an aggregate
market value equal to more than five percent of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation, (c) representing
more than ten percent of the consolidated earning power or net income of the corporation, and (d) certain other transactions with an
interested stockholder or an affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder. 

The
business combination statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage
attempts to acquire the Company even though such a transaction may offer the Company s stockholders the opportunity to sell their
stock at a price above the prevailing market price. 

Nevada
Control Share Acquisition Statute . Sections 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, of the Nevada Revised Statutes limit the voting rights
of certain acquired shares in a corporation. This control share statute applies to any acquisition of outstanding voting
securities of a Nevada corporation that has 200 or more stockholders of record (at least 100 of which are Nevada residents) and conducts
business in Nevada resulting in ownership of the corporation s then outstanding voting securities in excess of one of the following
thresholds: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, (iii) and a majority or more.
Once an acquirer crosses one of these thresholds by acquiring a controlling interest in the corporation, the shares which the acquirer
acquired in the transaction taking it over the threshold and within the 90 days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person
acquired or offered to acquire a controlling interest in the corporation become control shares. The acquirer is denied
voting rights with respect to the control shares, unless stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the corporation
approve the granting of full voting rights to the control shares. As permitted under Nevada law, the Company has elected to opt out of the control share statute pursuant to a provision in
its Bylaws. 

Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 

The
Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that: 

authorize
 the Board of Directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, and
 with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, and establish the rights and terms of that series; 

establish
 advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors to be brought
 before a stockholders meeting; 

allow
 the Company s directors to establish the size of the Board of Directors and fill vacancies on the Board created by an increase
 in the number of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under
 specified circumstances); 

require
 the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the voting power of all of the then- outstanding shares of capital stock
 of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in order to remove a director or the entire Board of Directors
 for cause; 

do
 not provide stockholders cumulative voting rights with respect to director elections; and 

provide
 that the Company s Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors without stockholder approval; provided, however, that the
 stockholders may amend the Bylaws only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the voting power of all of
 the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 

Provisions
of the Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual
or potential change in the Company s control or change in the Company s Board of Directors or management, including transactions
in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that the Company s stockholders might
otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of the Common Stock. 

Authorized
and Unissued Shares 

The
Company s authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval except
as may otherwise be required by applicable stock exchange rules or Nevada law. The Company may issue additional shares for a variety
of purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, to fund acquisitions and as employee and consultant compensation.
The existence of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock could render more difficult, or discourage an attempt, to obtain control
of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

The
Company s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of blank check 
preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s Board of
Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with dividend,
liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the value, voting power or other rights of holders of Common
Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may, under certain circumstances, issue preferred stock in order to delay, defer, prevent
or make more difficult a change of control transaction such as a merger, tender offer, business combination or proxy contest, assumption
of control by a holder of a large block of the Company s securities or the removal of incumbent management of the Company, even
if those events were favorable to the interests of the Company s stockholders. Although the Company s Board of Directors
has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future.
