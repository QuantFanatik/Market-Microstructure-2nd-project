Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor Provisions 
 All statements in this report that address events, developments or results that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, Section 21E of the Exchange Act and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In most cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as anticipate, may, will, could, should, would, expect, intend, plan, goal, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, project, potential, continue, seek, strategy, future, likely or the negative or other variations on these words and other similar expressions. These statements, which may include, without limitation, projections regarding our future performance and financial condition, are made on the basis of management s current views and assumptions with respect to future events. These statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We operate in a changing environment where new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks that may affect us. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and the forward-looking statements, as well as our prospects as a whole, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: 
 the health of the U.S. housing market generally and changes in economic conditions that impact the size of the insurable mortgage market, the credit performance of our insured mortgage portfolio and our business prospects, including more recently, changes resulting from inflationary pressures, the higher interest rate environment and the risks of a recession and higher unemployment rates, as well as other macroeconomic stresses such as those that may arise from the Russia-Ukraine conflict or other geopolitical events; 
 changes in the way customers, investors, ratings agencies, regulators or legislators perceive our performance, financial strength and future prospects; 
 Radian Guaranty s ability to remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs; 
 our ability to maintain an adequate level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries to satisfy current and future regulatory requirements; 
 changes in the charters or business practices of, or rules or regulations imposed by or applicable to, the GSEs or loans purchased by the GSEs, which may include changes in furtherance of housing policy objectives such as the accessibility and affordability of homeownership for low- and moderate-income borrowers and underrepresented communities, or changes in the requirements for Radian Guaranty to remain an approved insurer to the GSEs, such as changes in the PMIERs or the GSEs interpretation and application of the PMIERs or other applicable requirements; 
 the effects of the ERCF, which establishes a new regulatory capital framework for the GSEs, and which, as finalized, increases the capital requirements for the GSEs, and among other things, could impact the GSEs operations and pricing as well as the size of the insurable mortgage market, and which may form the basis for future changes to the PMIERs to better align with the ERCF; 
 changes in the current housing finance system in the United States, including the roles of the FHA, the GSEs and private mortgage insurers in this system; 
 our ability to successfully execute and implement our capital plans, including our risk distribution strategy through the capital markets and traditional reinsurance markets, and to maintain sufficient holding company liquidity to meet our liquidity needs; 
 our ability to successfully execute and implement our business plans and strategies, including plans and strategies that may require GSE and/or regulatory approvals and licenses, that are subject to complex compliance requirements that we may be unable to satisfy, or that may expose us to new risks, including those that could impact our capital and liquidity positions; 
 uncertainty from the discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to one or more alternative benchmarks that could cause interest rate volatility and, among other things, impact our investment portfolio, cost of debt and cost of reinsurance through mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions; 
 risks related to the quality of third-party mortgage underwriting and mortgage servicing; 
 a decrease in the Persistency Rates of our mortgage insurance on Monthly Premium Policies; 
 competition in the private mortgage insurance industry generally, and more specifically: price competition in our mortgage insurance business, including the prevalence of formulaic, granular risk-based pricing methodologies that are less transparent than historical rate-card-based pricing practices; and competition from the FHA and VA as well as from other forms of credit enhancement, such as GSE-sponsored alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance;

 legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations that could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief that could require significant expenditures, new or increased reserves or have other effects on our business; 
 the amount and timing of potential payments or adjustments associated with federal or other tax examinations; 
 the possibility that we may fail to estimate accurately, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty, the likelihood, magnitude and timing of losses in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance business or to accurately calculate and/or project our Available Assets and Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, which will be impacted by, among other things, the size and mix of our IIF, the level of defaults in our portfolio, the reported status of defaults in our portfolio (including whether they are subject to mortgage forbearance, a repayment plan or a loan modification trial period), the level of cash flow generated by our insurance operations and our risk distribution strategies;

Summary of Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, but are not limited to, the following material risks and uncertainties: 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy. 
 Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses. 
 Legislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses. 
 Risks Related to our Business Operations 
 Our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our mortgage insurance underwriting risks; the mortgage insurance premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured mortgage risks. We expect to incur losses for future mortgage defaults beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements. 
 If the estimates we use in establishing mortgage insurance loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our Loss Mitigation Activity could negatively impact our customer relationships. 
 Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses. 
 An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our inventory of defaulted mortgage loans may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay. 
 If the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force declines, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues. 
 Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims. 
 Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. 
 Our NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers. 
 The current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company. 
 Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing. 
 We face risks associated with our contract underwriting business. 
 A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our homegenius businesses. 
 We are exposed to risks associated with our homegenius businesses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely upon proprietary technology and information, and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on us . 
 We face risks associated with our new mortgage conduit business. 
 Risks Related to the Economic Environment 
 The credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages. 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio. 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 

Climate change and extreme weather events could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our reported earnings, stockholders equity and book value per share are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our investments that require us to adjust their fair market value. 
 The discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect us. 
 Risks Related to Liquidity and Financing 
 Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations. 
 Our revolving credit facility and the Parent Guarantees we provide for the Master Repurchase Agreements to finance loan purchases in our mortgage conduit business contain restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility or these Parent Guarantees could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it. 
 Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
 Our information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers demands. 
 We could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems, or of our third-party vendors or service providers, is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including personally identifiable information that we maintain. 
 Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally 
 We may not continue to pay dividends at the same rate we are currently paying them, or at all, and any decrease in or suspension of payment of a dividend could cause our stock price to decline. 
 We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
 We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements. 
 Investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business subject us to additional risks and uncertainties. 
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted us and, in the future, our business, results of operations or financial condition could again be impacted by COVID-19 or other epidemics, pandemics or public health developments.

 Overview 
 We are a diversified mortgage and real estate services business. We provide mortgage insurance and other products and services to the real estate and mortgage finance industries through our two business segments Mortgage and homegenius. While we manage and report on these two segments separately, we take an enterprise approach under our One Radian strategy, which leverages the value of our employees across our diversified businesses to better serve our customers. 
 Our Mortgage segment aggregates, manages and distributes U.S. mortgage credit risk for the benefit of mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, and also provides contract underwriting and other credit risk management solutions to our customers. Our homegenius segment offers an array of title, real estate and technology products and services to consumers, mortgage lenders, mortgage and real estate investors, GSEs and real estate brokers and agents. In addition to these business segments, as an extension of our strategy to aggregate, manage and distribute U.S. mortgage credit risk, in July 2022 we announced the launch of a mortgage conduit through Radian Mortgage Capital. Subject to market conditions, Radian Mortgage Capital acquires residential mortgage loans which it expects to then distribute into the capital markets through private label securitizations or sell directly to mortgage investors, with the option to retain and manage structured components of the underlying credit risk. See Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our businesses. 
 Radian Group serves as the holding company for our insurance and other subsidiaries, through which we offer our products and services, and does not have any operations of its own. Our principal executive offices are located at 550 East Swedesford Road, Suite 350, Wayne, PA 19087, and our telephone number is (215) 231-1000.

 Mortgage 
 Overview 
 Private mortgage insurance plays an important role in the U.S. housing finance system because it promotes affordable homeownership, while helping to protect mortgage lenders, investors and the GSEs, who are the primary beneficiaries of our mortgage insurance, by mitigating default-related losses on residential mortgage loans. Generally, the loans we insure are made to home buyers who make down payments of less than 20 of the purchase price for their home or, in the case of refinancings, have less than 20 equity in their home. Private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are currently sold to the GSEs. 
 The performance of our Mortgage business is particularly influenced by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including seasonal fluctuations and other events that impact mortgage originations and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, most of which are beyond our control, such as housing prices, inflationary pressures, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other national and regional economic conditions. In Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, see Overview Current Operating Environment and Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage. 
 Our Mortgage business is subject to comprehensive regulation by state and federal regulatory authorities and the GSEs. As the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans, and therefore, the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the GSEs impose eligibility requirements, known as PMIERs, that private mortgage insurers must satisfy in order to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. These requirements and practices, as well as those of the federal regulators that oversee the GSEs and lenders, impact the operating results and financial performance of private mortgage insurers. See Regulation below for a comprehensive description of the significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses. 
 
 Mortgage Insurance Products 
 Primary Mortgage Insurance 
 Primary Mortgage Insurance represents our most common form of mortgage insurance execution. We mainly provide Primary Mortgage Insurance on an individual loan basis as each mortgage is originated, but we also can provide Primary Mortgage Insurance on individual loans in an aggregate group of mortgages after they have been originated. We mainly write Primary Mortgage Insurance in a first loss position, where we are responsible for the first losses incurred on an insured loan subject to a policy limit. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Characteristics Mortgage Loan Characteristics . 
 The terms of our Primary Mortgage Insurance coverage are set forth in a Master Policy that we enter into with each of our customers. Among other things, our Master Policies set forth the applicable terms and conditions of our mortgage insurance coverage, including among others: loan eligibility requirements; premium payment requirements; coverage terms, including cancellation of coverage; provisions for policy administration; mortgage servicing standards and requirements; exclusions or reductions in coverage under certain circumstances; insurance rescission and rescission relief provisions; claims payment and settlement procedures; and dispute resolution procedures. Our Master Policy forms, which are updated periodically, including in response to requirements issued by the GSEs, are filed in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our Master Policy form was last updated on a broad basis in 2020, when most private mortgage insurers adopted a uniform master policy. See Defaults and Claims Claims Management Rescissions . 
 Primary Mortgage Insurance provides protection against mortgage defaults at a specified coverage percentage. When there is a valid claim under Primary Mortgage Insurance, our maximum liability is determined by multiplying the claim amount, which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest and certain expenses associated with the default, by the coverage percentage. Claims may be settled for the maximum liability or for other amounts. See Defaults and Claims Claims Management below. Although the Primary Mortgage Insurance we write protects the insured parties from a portion of losses resulting from mortgage defaults, it generally does not provide protection against property loss or physical damage, including damage caused by hurricanes or other severe weather events or natural disasters. 
 We wrote 68.0 billion and 91.8 billion of first-lien Primary Mortgage Insurance in 2022 and 2021, respectively. After taking into consideration insurance cancellations and other adjustments within our existing portfolio, our 2022 NIW resulted in IIF of 261.0 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 246.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Our total direct Primary Mortgage Insurance RIF was 66.1 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 60.9 billion at December 31, 2021.

Other Mortgage Insurance Products 
 GSE Credit Risk Transfer. Our business strategy includes leveraging our core expertise in credit risk management to expand our presence in the mortgage finance industry, including by pursuing alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance execution to expand our insured portfolio of mortgage credit. In the past, we participated in credit risk transfer programs developed by the GSEs as part of their programs to further distribute mortgage credit risk and increase the role of private capital in the mortgage market. These programs transfer additional credit risk on an excess-of-loss basis to insurance and reinsurance providers on pools of mortgage loans, which may contain loans that are already covered by private mortgage insurance. 
 Based on our view of the projected returns on this business, including consideration of the collateral and capital required by the GSEs to support this RIF, we discontinued our participation in the GSEs credit risk transfer transactions in 2021. This business was conducted through our subsidiary, Radian Reinsurance, which in December 2022 novated all of its RIF related to credit risk transfer transactions to an unaffiliated third-party reinsurer and merged with Radian Guaranty. As a result of the novation, we had no RIF under these credit risk transfer transactions as of December 31, 2022, compared to 418 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about this novation. 
 Pool Mortgage Insurance. Prior to 2008, we wrote Pool Mortgage Insurance on a limited basis. At December 31, 2022, our total direct first-lien Pool Mortgage Insurance RIF was 240 million, as compared to 246 million at December 31, 2021, and represented less than 1 of our total direct first-lien insurance RIF. Our Pool Mortgage Insurance policies are privately negotiated and are separate from the Master Policies that we use for our Primary Mortgage Insurance. 
 
 Pricing 
 Primary Mortgage Insurance Premiums 
 We apply premium rates to our mortgage insurance products at the time coverage is requested by our customers, which is generally near the time of loan origination. Premiums for our mortgage insurance products are generally established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics as well as current and projected market and economic conditions. Our premium rates are subject to regulation, and in most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, the formulations by which we derive our premiums must be filed with the state insurance regulators, and in some cases approved by them, before their use. See Regulation State Regulation. 
 We have developed our pricing strategy to manage the risk/return profile and maximize the long-term economic value of our insured portfolio by balancing credit risk, profitability and volume considerations in light of the current and projected competitive environment. We evaluate the projected long-term economic value of our insured portfolio by using a measure that incorporates expected lifetime returns for our insurance policies, taking into consideration projected premiums, credit losses, investment income, operating expenses, taxes and an assumed cost of capital. This projected economic value is then discounted to arrive at an estimated present value of the long-term economic value of our insured portfolio. We use this economic value to assist us in evaluating various portfolio strategies and identifying opportunities to create stockholder value. Consistent with this strategy, our premium rates are based on a broad range of factors, including our expectations about competitive pricing levels and cost of capital, as well as other factors and risk attributes that we consider in developing our assumptions about loan and policy performance and expected returns on such insurance. 
 Premiums on our mortgage insurance products generally are written on either: (i) a recurring basis, which can be monthly or annual premiums, pursuant to our Monthly and Other Recurring Premium Policies or (ii) as a single premium generally paid at the time of loan origination pursuant to our Single Premium Policies. We also offer products where premiums are paid as a combination of an up-front premium at origination, plus a monthly installment. In addition, premiums may include a refundable component. While the majority of our policies terminate when certain criteria, such as prescribed LTV levels, are met, some of our products provide coverage for the life of the loan, subject to certain conditions. There are many factors that influence the types of premiums we receive, including, among others: (i) the preference of customers with whom we do business and (ii) the relative premium levels we and our competitors set for the various forms of premiums offered. 
 Mortgage insurance premiums can be funded through a number of methods, and while the coverage remains for the benefit of the insured lender or third-party beneficiary, the premiums may be paid by the borrower or by the lender. Borrower-paid Monthly and Other Recurring Premiums are generally paid to us as part of the borrower s monthly mortgage payment, while borrower-paid premiums under our Single Premium Policies are paid to us at the time of closing on the home purchase. Lender-paid mortgage insurance premiums are paid by the lender and are typically passed through to the borrower in the form of additional origination fees or a higher interest rate on the mortgage note. 
 The premium rates on a majority of the RIF covered under Monthly and Other Recurring Premium Policies were established as a fixed percentage of the initial loan balance for a set period of time (typically 10 years), after which the premium generally declines to a lower fixed percentage for the remaining life of the policy. The premium rates on the RIF covered under the remaining Monthly and Other Recurring Premium Policies within our insured portfolio were established as a fixed percentage of the loan s amortizing balance over the life of the policy.

 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

Historically, premiums in the mortgage insurance industry were primarily established through standard rate-cards filed with state insurance regulatory authorities, with limited flexibility to deviate. Beginning on a broad basis in 2019, the mortgage insurance industry began to widely use various pricing methodologies with differing degrees of risk-based granularity. Although these more recent pricing frameworks are based upon the same general risk attributes that historically have been a part of mortgage insurance pricing, they also incorporate more granular risk-based pricing factors based on multiple loan, borrower and property attributes. 
 The shift away from a predominantly standard rate-card based pricing model and the increase in black box pricing frameworks throughout the mortgage insurance industry provides a more dynamic pricing capability that allows for more frequent pricing changes that can be implemented quickly and has contributed to a reduction in overall pricing transparency. Further, in addition to the growing proliferation of black box pricing, industry pricing practices in recent years have also included an increased use of customized rate plans for certain customers, pursuant to which rates may be awarded to certain customers based on a number of factors for only a limited period of time. With the increased prevalence of granular, black box pricing and the greater uniformity of master policy terms throughout the industry, pricing has become the predominant competitive market factor for private mortgage insurance, and an increasing number of customers are making their choice of mortgage insurance providers primarily based on the lowest price available for any particular loan. 
 We offer a spectrum of risk-based pricing solutions for our customers. This approach represents a continuation of our strategy to pursue multiple pricing delivery options that are best suited to a lender s loan origination process and balanced with our own objectives for managing our volume of NIW and the economic value derived from our mortgage insurance portfolio. In Item 1A. Risk Factors see Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. 
 
 Underwriting 
 Mortgage loan applications are underwritten to determine whether they are eligible for our mortgage insurance. We perform this function directly or, alternatively, we delegate to our insured lenders the ability to underwrite the mortgage loans on our behalf. 
 Delegated Underwriting. Through our delegated underwriting program, we approve insured lenders to underwrite mortgage loan insurance applications based on our mortgage insurance underwriting guidelines. Each lender participating in the delegated underwriting program must be approved by our risk management group. Utilization of our delegated underwriting program enables us to meet lenders demands for immediate decisions on mortgage insurance coverage and increases the efficiency of their underwriting process. We use quality control sampling and performance monitoring to manage the risks associated with delegated underwriting. Under the terms of the program, we have certain rights to rescind coverage if there has been a deviation from our underwriting guidelines. For a discussion of these limited Rescission rights, see Defaults and Claims Claims Management Rescissions . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 70 and 69 , respectively, of our total first-lien IIF had been originated on a delegated basis. 
 Non-Delegated Underwriting. Approved insured lenders may submit mortgage loan applications to us so that we may perform the mortgage insurance underwriting. Some customers prefer our non-delegated underwriting program because we assume responsibility for underwriting the mortgage insurance and, subject to the terms of our Master Policies, generally have less ability to rescind coverage if there is an underwriting error. We leverage loan application data and analytics to categorize mortgage insurance applications based on credit risk and underwriting complexity to improve efficiency in our process and to ensure a heightened focus on the higher-risk, complex applications. We also use quality control sampling, loan performance monitoring and training to manage the risks associated with our non-delegated underwriting program. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, 26 of our total first-lien IIF had been originated on a non-delegated basis. 
 Contract Underwriting. We also provide third-party contract underwriting services to our mortgage insurance customers pursuant to which we underwrite the mortgage loan for compliance with investor guidelines which, if necessary, may be separate from or in addition to underwriting for our mortgage insurance eligibility. Generally, we offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers. To manage the risks associated with contract underwriting, we train our underwriters, require them to complete continuing education and routinely audit performance to monitor the accuracy and consistency of underwriting practices. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 4 and 5 , respectively, of our total first-lien IIF had been underwritten through contract underwriting. 
 
 Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Characteristics 
 Direct Risk in Force 
 Exposure in our mortgage insurance business is measured by RIF, which for Primary Mortgage Insurance is equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan multiplied by our insurance coverage percentage. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Insurance and Risk in Force for additional information about the composition of our Primary RIF.

 Part I. Item 1. Business 

We analyze our mortgage insurance portfolio in a number of ways to identify potential concentrations or imbalances in risk dispersion. We believe that, among other factors, the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is affected significantly by: 
 general economic conditions (in particular, interest rates, home prices and unemployment); 
 the characteristics of the loans insured including, but not limited to, the amount of equity borrowers have in their properties, the borrowers credit characteristics, the size of the loans and the age and performance history of the loans; 
 the geographic dispersion and other characteristics of the properties securing the insured loans, such as the primary purpose of the properties and the condition of local housing markets, including whether the properties are increasing or decreasing in value over time; 
 the quality of loan underwriting and servicing; and 
 the number of borrowers and credit characteristics of the borrower(s). 
 Persistency Rate 
 The Persistency Rate measures the amount of time that our insurance is remaining in force, which has a significant impact on our revenues and our results of operations. Because premiums on our Recurring Premium Policies are earned over time, higher Persistency Rates on these policies increase the premiums we receive and generally result in increased profitability and returns. Conversely, assuming all other factors remain constant, higher Persistency Rates on Single Premium Policies lower the overall returns on these products, as the premium revenue for our Single Premium Policies is the same regardless of the actual life of the insurance policy. 
 As the primary measure of the length of time that our insurance remains in force, the Persistency Rate incorporates the impact that policy cancellations have on our IIF. Provided that all required premiums are paid, coverage for a loan under our Master Policy generally will be cancelled on the first of the following to occur: (i) the loan insured under the certificate is paid in full, including in the event of a refinance transaction; (ii) we settle a claim with respect to the certificate; (iii) we act upon the insured s or its servicer s instruction to cancel coverage under the certificate, including as may be required by the HPA or pursuant to GSE guidelines; (iv) the term of coverage expires under the premium plan or upon the terms specified in the certificate; or (v) we cancel, rescind or deny coverage under the certificate. For more information, in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, see Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage IIF and Related Drivers and Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Insurance and Risk in Force. 
 Historically, there has been a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates. Higher interest rate environments generally decrease refinancings, which decrease the cancellation rate of our insurance and positively affect our Persistency Rates. See Regulation Federal Regulation Mortgage Insurance Cancellation for more information regarding cancellation and termination requirements for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance meeting certain criteria under the HPA. 
 Geographic Dispersion 
 Radian Guaranty is authorized to write mortgage insurance in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. We have a geographically diversified mortgage insurance portfolio, and we proactively monitor the portfolio for concentration risks at both the state level and metropolitan area level known as Core Based Statistical Areas CBSAs ). As of December 31, 2022, our largest state concentration was in Texas, which represented 9.4 of RIF, and our largest CSBAs concentration was the New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan area, which represented 5.5 of RIF. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Insurance and Risk in Force Geographic Dispersion for additional information about the geographic dispersion of our direct Primary Mortgage Insurance. 
 In Item 1A. Risk Factors, also see The credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages and Climate change and extreme weather events could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition . 
 Mortgage Loan Characteristics 
 Factors that contribute significantly to our overall risk diversification and the credit quality of our RIF include, among others, geographic dispersion, as discussed above, as well as our mix of mortgage insurance products, the quality of loan underwriting and our risk management practices. In evaluating the credit quality of our portfolio and developing our pricing and risk management strategies, we consider a number of borrower, loan and property characteristics in assessing our risk of loss, including LTV and FICO score, as well as a number of other loan and property characteristics, including, without limitation, debt-to-income ratio, average loan size, property type, occupancy type, loan type and term, loan purpose and number of borrowers. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Portfolio for additional information about the credit quality and characteristics of our direct Primary Mortgage Insurance.

Defaults and Claims 
 Defaults 
 In our mortgage insurance business, the default and claim cycle begins with the receipt of a default notice from the loan servicer. We consider a loan to be in default for financial statement and internal tracking purposes upon receipt of notification by servicers that a borrower has missed two monthly payments. Defaults can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, factors impacting economic conditions (e.g., regional economic disruptions or disaster related events such as epidemics/pandemics, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and wildfires) or other events. Regional economic disruptions derived from natural disasters may be exacerbated by climate change and related environmental factors, which could increase the frequency, scope and intensity of such disasters. 
 The default rate in our mortgage insurance business is subject to seasonality. Historically, our mortgage insurance business experiences a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of Cures. While historically this has been the case, macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence the default rate in our mortgage insurance business more than seasonality. 
 Currently, a segment of U.S. residential mortgage loans may be subject to, or eligible for, certain types of relief as a result of the legislative response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CARES Act. Upon request by borrowers of federally or GSE-backed mortgage loans who attest to financial hardship related to the pandemic, the CARES Act requires mortgage servicers to provide these borrowers with up to 180 days forbearance on their mortgage payments, which may be extended for an additional 180 days upon request. According to the statute, the forbearance requirements of the CARES Act are available during a covered period, which may be interpreted to expire on, or shortly after, the declared COVID-19 national emergency ends, which is expected to occur on May 11, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 34 of our primary loans in default remain in a forbearance program. 
 As COVID-19 forbearances end, federal law requires servicers to discuss forbearance and loss mitigation options with their borrowers and afford additional protections to borrowers before their loans are referred to foreclosure. Additionally, the CARES Act provided a temporary foreclosure and eviction moratorium for residential mortgagors with certain federally or GSE-backed mortgages that have now expired. However, the existence of these moratoriums has significantly impacted the claims process since 2020 by preventing the procedural steps necessary for a claim under our insurance policies to be filed, as discussed below under Claims. While foreclosure filings have resumed, foreclosure activity remains lower than it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Regulation Federal Regulation CARES Act. While the CARES Act and related federally mandated borrower relief has provided critical support to the housing finance system throughout the pandemic, the ultimate performance of loans that remain in forbearance is not yet known. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our inventory of defaulted mortgage loans may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay . 
 Claims 
 Defaulted loans that fail to become current, or cure, may result in a claim under our mortgage insurance policies. The rate at which defaults cure, or do not go to claim, depends in large part on a borrower s financial resources and circumstances (including whether the borrower is eligible for a loan modification), local housing prices (i.e., whether borrowers are able to cure defaults by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage), interest rates, unemployment, inflationary pressures and other factors impacting economic conditions. 
 In our first-lien Primary Mortgage Insurance business, in order to submit a claim, the insured must first either acquire title to the property (typically through a foreclosure proceeding) or we must approve a third-party sale of the property. The time for a lender to acquire title to a property through foreclosure varies depending on the state, and in particular whether a state requires a lender to proceed through the judicial system to complete the foreclosure. Claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business. Historically, except for periods of economic distress, we have experienced relatively few claims during the first two years following issuance of a policy. 
 In recent years, the average time for us to receive a claim has increased as a result of COVID-19-related relief programs discussed above. For example, payment and foreclosure forbearance programs instituted at the federal and state levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused defaulted loans to remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time. While the impact, if any, currently is hard to predict, we also may see impacts on claims with respect to loans secured by New York properties due to the state s passage of the Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act, which places new limitations on servicers regarding the de-acceleration of mortgage loan debt as a mechanism to toll, or reset, the State of New York s six-year statute of limitations for foreclosure actions. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our inventory of defaulted mortgage loans may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay . 
 For Pool Mortgage Insurance, which represents less than 1 of our RIF at December 31, 2022, o ur policies typically require the insured to not only acquire title but also to actively market and ultimately liquidate the real estate asset before filing a claim, which generally lengthens the time between a default and a claim submission.

 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

In addition to claim volume, Claim Severity is another significant factor affecting losses. We calculate the Claim Severity by dividing the claim paid amount by the original coverage amount. Factors that impact the severity of a claim include, but are not limited to, the size of the loan, the amount of mortgage insurance coverage placed on the loan, the amount of time between default and claim during which we are expected to cover certain interest (capped at two years under our Prior Master Policy and capped at three years under our 2014 and 2020 Master Policies) and expenses, and the impact of our Loss Mitigation and other loss management activities with respect to the loan. 
 Home price appreciation as well as pre-foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall Claim Severity, as do actions we may take to reduce a claim payment due to servicer negligence, as discussed below in Claims Management. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Mortgage Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Expenses Provision for Losses . 
 Claims Management 
 Our claims management process is focused on analyzing and processing claims to ensure that we pay valid claims in accordance with our policies. Our mortgage insurance claims management department pursues opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after claims are received. 
 In our mortgage insurance business, upon receipt of a valid claim, we have a range of settlement options for calculating the claim amount (also referred to as calculated loss), as set forth in our Master Policies. Most frequently, we settle a valid claim with the Percentage Option by paying the maximum liability and allowing the insured lender to keep title to the property. For this purpose, the maximum liability is determined by multiplying (x) the claim amount (which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest for a period of time specified in our Master Policies, plus certain expenses associated with the default, and minus certain deductions) by (y) the applicable coverage percentage. We also have the following alternative settlement options under our Master Policies: 
 (i) Approved Sale Option: Subject to any reduction provided for in our Master Policies, we may pay the claim amount (not to exceed the lender s entire loss or our maximum liability under the Percentage Option) by taking into account the net proceeds received by the lender following an approved sale such as a short sale or deed-in-lieu transaction; 
 (ii) Acquisition Option: Subject to any reduction provided for elsewhere in our Master Policies, we may pay the entire claim amount (as described above but without application of the coverage percentage) upon the conveyance to us of good and marketable title to the property; or 
 (iii) Anticipated Loss Option: In certain circumstances, as outlined in our Master Policies, this claim settlement option is primarily based on the claim amount minus the net proceeds we reasonably anticipate would be generated if the property, in its original condition on the effective insurance commitment date, reasonable wear and tear excepted, were sold to a third party for fair market value. 
 Approved sales in which the underlying property has been sold for less than the outstanding loan amount are commonly referred to as short sales. Although short sales may have the effect of reducing our ultimate claim obligation, in many cases, a short sale will result in the payment of a claim in an amount that is equal to the maximum liability amount under the Percentage Option. 
 Under our Master Policies, we retain the right to consent prior to consummation of any short sale. We have entered into agreements with each of the GSEs pursuant to which we delegate to the GSEs our prior consent rights with respect to short sales on loans owned by the GSEs, as long as the short sales meet applicable GSE guidelines and processes for short sales and subject to certain other factors set forth in these agreements. 
 We also provide for limited delegation authority to certain loan servicers for short sales under specific circumstances. For loans that are not owned by the GSEs and for which we have not granted specific delegation authority to the loan servicer, we perform an individual analysis of each proposed short sale and provide our consent to these sales when appropriate. Historically, we have consented to a short sale only after reviewing various factors, including among other items, the sale price relative to market and the ability of the borrower to contribute to any shortfall in the sale proceeds as compared to the outstanding loan amount. 
 After a claim is received, our loss management specialists may focus on: 
 a review to determine compliance with applicable loan origination programs and our Master Policy requirements, including: (i) whether the loan qualified for insurance at the time the certificate of coverage (i.e., policy) was issued; (ii) whether the insured has satisfied its obligation in meeting all necessary conditions in order for us to pay a claim, including submitting all necessary documentation in connection with the claim (commonly referred to as claim perfection and (iii) whether the loan was appropriately serviced in accordance with the standards set forth in our Master Policies; 
 analysis and prompt processing to ensure that valid claims are paid in an accurate and timely manner;

responses to loss mitigation opportunities presented by the insured; and 
 management and disposal of acquired real estate. 
 Radian Guaranty has entered into a Factored Claim Administration Agreement with Fannie Mae that applies to certain loans owned by Fannie Mae that were insured under our Master Policies for which a claim is submitted on or after October 1, 2018. Pursuant to the agreement, for the loans subject to the agreement, Radian Guaranty will determine the amount of covered expenses forming part of a loss (other than unpaid principal balance and delinquent interest) using prenegotiated expense factors. The expense factors are based on certain characteristics of each covered loan, including the unpaid principal balance at the time of default, property type and location, and property disposition. 
 Claim Denials 
 We have the legal right under our Master Policies to deny a claim under certain conditions, such as when the loan servicer does not produce documents necessary to perfect a claim (e.g., evidence that the insured has acquired title to the property) within the time period specified in our Master Policies. Most often, a Claim Denial is the result of a servicer s failure to provide the loan origination file or other critical servicing documents for review. 
 If, after requests by us, the loan origination file or other servicing documents are not provided to us, we generally deny the claim. If we deny a claim, we may continue to allow the insured the ability to perfect the claim for a limited period of time, as specified in our Master Policies. If the insured successfully perfects the claim on a timely basis, we will process the claim, including, as appropriate, by conducting a review of the loan file to ensure that underwriting and loan servicing were conducted properly. 
 If, after completion of this process, we determine that the claim was not perfected, other conditions precedent to coverage have not been met, or any exclusions apply, the insurance claim is denied and we consider the Claim Denial to be final and resolved. Although we may make a final determination with respect to a Claim Denial, it is possible that after we have denied coverage a legal challenge to our decision may be brought within a period of time specified under the terms of our Master Policies. 
 Rescissions 
 Mortgage insurance master policies generally protect mortgage insurers from the risk of material misrepresentations and fraud in the origination of an insured loan by establishing the right, under certain conditions, to unilaterally rescind coverage. Under the terms of our Master Policies, typical events that may give rise to our right to rescind coverage include: (i) we insured a loan in reliance upon an application for insurance that contained a material misstatement, misrepresentation or omission, whether intentional or otherwise, or that was issued as a result of an act of fraud or (ii) we find that there was negligence in the origination of a loan that we insured. We also have rights of Rescission arising from a breach of the insured s representations and warranties that are contained in our Master Policies or endorsements thereto and are required with our delegated underwriting program. 
 If we rescind coverage based on a determination that a loan did not qualify for insurance, we provide the insured with a period of time to challenge or rebut our decision. If a rebuttal to our Rescission is received and the insured provides additional information supporting the continuation (i.e., non-rescission) of coverage, we have the claim re-examined internally by a separate independent investigator. If the additional information supports the continuation of coverage, the insurance is reinstated and if there is a claim, it proceeds to the next step in our claims review process. Otherwise, if we determine that the loan did not qualify for coverage, the insurance policy is rescinded (and we issue a premium refund under the terms of our Master Policies), and we consider the Rescission to be final and resolved. Although we may make a final determination internally with respect to a Rescission, it is possible that a legal challenge to our decision to rescind coverage may be brought after we have rescinded coverage during a period of time that is specified under the terms of our Master Policies. 
 We have incorporated provisions into our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy that generally provide Rescission relief based on the number of months that borrowers remain current on their mortgage loans. As a consequence, our rights to conduct Loss Mitigation Activity involving Rescission as a remedy generally are more limited under these Master Policies as compared to our Prior Master Policy. Our more recent Master Policies continue to include certain life-of-loan reservation of Rescission rights specified in the Master Policy, including fraud and certain patterns of fraud. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses . 
 Claim Curtailments 
 We depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Servicers are responsible for being the primary contact with borrowers regarding their loans, and we generally do not have first-party contact with borrowers. Dependable loan servicing is necessary for, among other things, timely billing and premium payments to us and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. As such, proper loan servicing is critical to the performance of our insured mortgage portfolio, especially when borrowers are experiencing difficulty paying their mortgages. 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

Our Master Policies require servicers to service our insured loans in a reasonable, prudent manner consistent with the highest standards of servicing in use in the residential mortgage industry, and we have rights under our Master Policies to curtail, and in some circumstances, deny claims due to servicer negligence. Examples of servicer negligence may include, without limitation: 
 a failure to report information to us on a timely basis as required under our Master Policies; 
 a failure to pursue loss mitigation opportunities presented by borrowers, realtors and/or any other interested parties; 
 a failure to pursue loan modifications and/or refinancings through programs available to borrowers; 
 an undue delay in presenting claims to us (including as a result of improper handling of foreclosure proceedings), which increases the interest or other components of a claim we are required to pay; 
 a failure to initiate and diligently pursue foreclosure or other appropriate proceedings within the timeframe specified in our Master Policies; and 
 a failure to follow applicable foreclosure bidding instructions. 
 Although we could seek post-claim recoveries from the beneficiaries of our Master Policies if we later determine that a claim was not valid, because our loss mitigation process is designed to ensure compliance with our Master Policies prior to payment of a claim, historically, we have not sought recoveries from the beneficiaries of our Master Policies once a claim payment has been made. 
 From time to time, claims management may result in disputes with our customers that ultimately produce litigation or other legal proceedings. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Factors Affecting Our Results homegenius for additional information. 
 
 Services Offered 
 Title Services 
 We provide a comprehensive suite of insurance and non-insurance title, real estate closing and real estate settlement services for residential purchase, refinance, REO and home equity transactions to mortgage lenders, mortgage investors and GSEs as well as directly to consumers for residential mortgage loans. 
 Title insurance is a contract of indemnity for losses stemming from a covered defect in title to real property, such as adverse ownership interests, liens, or other encumbrances, that predates the policy and is not otherwise excluded or excepted from coverage. Our title policies are issued following a determination of the insurability of title, which is based on a title search that may include review of the public land records, court filings, maps, surveys, previously issued title policies, and any other documentation that may contain information concerning interests in real property. 
 There are two types of title insurance policies lenders policies and owners policies. Lenders policies insure the validity and priority of the insured mortgage and typically provide coverage up to the outstanding mortgage loan balance, until the loan is paid off. Owners policies are issued directly to the real estate purchaser and provide coverage to the owner in an amount equal to the purchase price of the property. Both types of policies are issued for a one-time premium paid at closing of the home purchase. Premium amounts vary across jurisdictions and also depend on the amount of coverage given and the type of policy being issued. 
 Losses on policies occur in the form of claims payouts and/or the cost of defending or establishing title. Title claims may arise from a number of factors, such as title search and examination errors, fraud, forgery, incorrect legal descriptions, and 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

failure to identify existing liens. Title insurers are also responsible for the cost of defending the insured in litigation alleging covered title defects, regardless of the merits of the allegations. 
 In addition to title insurance, we offer a full complement of title services that include tax reports; recording services; document retrieval; default title services; deed reports and property reports. Our closing and settlement services include electronic execution of some or all mortgage loan closing documents (eClosing), as well as traditional signing services. 
 Real Estate Services 
 We provide our customers with real estate services, including real estate asset management and real estate valuation services. Our asset management solutions help real estate investors and lenders improve execution on their real estate properties. Through these asset management services, we manage properties owned primarily by financial institutions and mortgage investors by overseeing the REO disposition process. We conduct this work primarily by engaging third-party independent contractors to perform the eviction and redemption process, as well as property preservation and repairs on behalf of our customers. 
 We also offer a full range of services for the benefit of the single-family rental asset class. This asset class primarily involves the securitization of a single loan backed by multiple rental properties owned primarily by large institutional investors. Our comprehensive single-family rental services provide a centralized, single point of contact for facilitating the property valuation and diligence services needed to support single-family rental warehouse lending and securitization activity. Our warehouse lending valuation and diligence reviews also serve institutional iBuyers, entities who use technology to value, purchase and thereafter securitize, rent or sell homes. 
 Through our licensed real estate broker subsidiary, homegenius Real Estate, we also provide a suite of real estate valuation products and services to lenders, servicers, investors and GSEs, including broker price opinions (i.e., price estimates provided by real estate brokers familiar with the particular market) and various valuations that utilize technology, including hybrid appraisals (where licensed appraisers access technology-enabled valuation services to support their valuations), automated valuation services (enabling a qualified user to obtain an estimated value based on a technology-driven analysis of data and information about comparable transactions) and interactive valuation services (where a qualified user can utilize their knowledge and preferences as inputs to technology tools to obtain a valuation estimate). 
 Technology Services 
 In addition to the services described above, we are developing a growing suite of proprietary real estate technology products and services, offered primarily through our licensed real estate broker subsidiary, homegenius Real Estate, that are designed to facilitate real estate transactions and are provided as SaaS solutions. 
 These digital services and solutions include: 
 geneuity, a SaaS smart workflow system that integrates features such as task management, pipeline tracking, contacts, document storage, e-signature and communication into a single platform enabling real estate brokers and agents to manage real estate transactions more efficiently; 
 geniusprice technology, a SaaS property intelligence platform that combines predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, automation and imaging review capabilities with a real estate broker s access to local data to create price estimates and property condition reports; and 
 homegenius connect, a service that helps match interested homebuyers with local real estate agents. 
 In addition, we offer a web-based asset management workflow solution to assist in managing REO assets, rental properties, due diligence for bulk acquisitions of multiple properties, loss mitigation efforts and short sales. 
 
 Revenue Drivers 
 Our homegenius segment is dependent upon overall activity in the mortgage finance and real estate markets, as well as the overall health of the related industries. Due, in part, to the transactional nature of the business, revenues for our homegenius segment are subject to fluctuations from period to period, including fluctuations that reflect the seasonal volume fluctuations in these markets. Sales volume is also affected by the number of competing companies and alternative products offered in the market. 
 We earn net premiums on title insurance written by Radian Title Insurance. For our other homegenius offerings, we primarily use fixed-price contracts, pursuant to which we agree to perform the specified services and deliverables for a pre-determined per-unit price. To a lesser extent, for a portion of our REO management services and our real estate brokerage services, we utilize percentage-of-sale contracts, under which we are paid a contractual percentage of the sale proceeds upon the sale of each property. 
 In most cases, our contracts with our clients do not include minimum volume commitments and can be terminated by them at any time. Although a portion of our contracts and assignments are recurring in nature and include recurring monthly 
 24

 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

assignments, the majority of our current homegenius revenues are transactional in nature and are generated in connection with securitizations, real estate purchases and sales or other transactions. 
 To the extent that our technology products and services grow in future periods as a percentage of our total homegenius revenues, a higher percentage of these total revenues would become recurring in nature. Due to the transactional nature of our current business, our homegenius segment revenues fluctuate from period to period as transactions are commenced or completed. In addition, our segment revenues are impacted by the volume of real estate transactions in the marketplace, which may fluctuate from period to period. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see We are exposed to risks associated with our homegenius businesses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition .

 In July 2022, we announced the launch of Radian Mortgage Capital, a mortgage conduit formed to provide residential mortgage lenders with an additional secondary-market option to sell eligible loans to us and ultimately to provide mortgage investors with another known sponsor. Subject to market conditions, Radian Mortgage Capital acquires residential mortgage loans, which Radian Mortgage Capital expects to then distribute into the capital markets through private label securitizations or sell directly to mortgage investors, with the option to retain and manage structured components of the underlying credit risk. Consistent with our stated strategy, Radian Mortgage Capital expands our capabilities to participate in the mortgage market to aggregate, manage and distribute residential mortgage credit risk. As of December 31, 2022, in light of the challenging market conditions in the secondary mortgage market, Radian Mortgage Capital had purchased only a limited number of loans, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, and has not yet conducted any securitizations. 
 See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the basis of our segment reporting, including the related allocations. 
 
 Competition 
 Mortgage 
 We operate in the highly competitive U.S. mortgage insurance industry. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA. 
 Including us, there are currently six active participants in the private mortgage industry that are approved and eligible to write business for the GSEs. The other participants are: 
 Arch Capital Group Ltd. (includes both Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company); 
 Enact Holdings, Inc. (formerly Genworth Mortgage Holdings, Inc.); 
 Essent Group Ltd.; 
 MGIC Investment Corporation; and 
 NMI Holdings, Inc. 
 We compete directly with other private mortgage insurers primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. Overall customer service competition in our mortgage insurance business is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, customer connectivity, timely and accurate administration of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. 
 For Radian, customer service also includes our ability to offer products and services through our homegenius businesses that are relevant to our mortgage insurance customers and complement our mortgage insurance products. 
 Pricing has always been competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, but as discussed above under Mortgage Pricing, with the increased prevalence of granular, black box pricing and custom rate cards throughout the industry and the 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

greater uniformity of master policy terms throughout the industry, pricing has become the predominant competitive market factor for private mortgage insurance. We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to enhance the long-term value of our mortgage insurance portfolio by balancing credit risk, profitability, and volume and capital considerations in developing our pricing strategies. 
 We establish our premium rates and seek to write a mix of business to manage the risk/return profile and maximize the long-term economic value of our mortgage insurance portfolio, taking into consideration the competitive environment. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage Premiums. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our share of NIW within the private mortgage insurance market was approximately 17 for 2022. 
 Certain of our private mortgage insurance competitors currently have better financial strength ratings than we have and/or are subsidiaries of larger corporations, which may give them a competitive advantage. 
 Private mortgage insurance competes for a share of the insurable mortgage market with the single-family mortgage insurance programs of the FHA and VA. Private mortgage insurance execution competes with the programs offered by the FHA on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. 
 We believe that better execution for borrowers with higher FICO scores and the inability to cancel FHA insurance for certain loans, in conjunction with the preference of certain lenders to execute through the GSEs, have served as competitive advantages for private mortgage insurance as compared to FHA insurance. The FHA s share of the total insured mortgage market (which includes FHA, VA and private mortgage insurers) was reported to be 27 in 2022, compared to 25 in 2021. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage NIW and Related Drivers . 
 On February 22, 2022, the FHA announced that it is reducing its annual mortgage insurance premium by 0.30 percentage points for most new borrowers. While we do not expect this pricing change to have a material impact on our NIW volumes, the FHA could institute further pricing changes in the future, including additional changes to its annual premiums, a reduction in its upfront premiums and/or the elimination of the life-of-loan premium requirement for most FHA insured loans. It is uncertain if and when the FHA may pursue any additional pricing or other actions and what form they may take; however, any change that would improve FHA execution compared to execution through the GSEs with private mortgage insurance could negatively impact our NIW volume. 
 If the competitive position of the FHA is enhanced, it could have a negative effect on our ability to compete with the FHA. See Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for a discussion of factors that could enhance the FHA s competitive position relative to private mortgage insurance. 
 We also have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA s share of the total insured mortgage market was 25 in 2022, compared to 31 in 2021. We believe that the VA remains a strong participant in the overall market because the VA insures 100 LTV loans, which is unavailable through private mortgage insurance and the FHA, charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no separate monthly payment, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA s program. 
 In addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. These alternatives have included structures commonly referred to as investor paid mortgage insurance in which affiliates of traditional mortgage insurers that are not subject to the PMIERs directly insure the GSEs against loss. For additional information about these structures, see Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices. 
 It is difficult to predict what other types of credit risk transfer transactions and structures or other forms of credit enhancement, including GSE-sponsored alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance, might be used in the future. If any of these alternatives were to displace standard primary loan level private mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced and our future prospects could be negatively impacted.

 We believe that through our homegenius segment we are positioned as a unique provider of an array of products and services to participants across the real estate value chain. While we are not aware of any other single company that provides a comparable range of services to the residential mortgage and real estate industries, our homegenius businesses have multiple significant competitors within each of its individual lines of business. 
 Significant competitors for our homegenius businesses include: 
 Title Services The market for traditional title services is highly concentrated among four large companies with national scope: Fidelity National Financial, Inc.; First American Financial Corporation; Old Republic International Corporation; and Stewart Information Services Corporation. In addition, we compete with smaller title service providers such as Boston National Title Agency; Mortgage Connect LP; ServiceLink IP Holding Company, LLC; and a host of additional regional providers.

addition, the introduction of alternatives to traditional title insurance into the market such as the recent offering of attorney opinion letters in lieu of traditional title policies, which is being accepted by the GSEs, subject to certain conditions, could provide additional competition. See Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for additional information. 
 Real Estate Services Real estate technology companies such as Black Knight, Inc.; ClearCapital.com, Inc.; CoreLogic, Inc.; HouseCanary, Inc.; and Xome Inc. 
 Technology Services We believe that our more recent technology services and products will compete with offerings from various real estate SaaS companies. 
 Across all business lines in our homegenius segment, we believe we compete on the basis of technology, data access, industry expertise, price, service levels and relationships. 
 
 Customers 
 Mortgage 
 The principal customers of our mortgage insurance business are mortgage originators such as mortgage banks, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. 
 We actively monitor our customer concentration and regularly engage in efforts to diversify our customer base; however, the increasing use of custom rate cards for individual lenders in the mortgage insurance marketplace has increased the likelihood that a significant portion of NIW volume generated in any given period may be attributable to one or more customers. Our largest single mortgage insurance customer (including branches and affiliates) measured by NIW, accounted for 8 of NIW during 2022, compared to 14 and 13 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The percentage of NIW generated by our top 10 customers was 34 in 2022. No single customer contributed earned premiums that accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Our NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers . 
 homegenius 
 We have a broad range of customers in our homegenius segment, including many of our Mortgage customers, due to the products and services we offer across the mortgage and real estate value chain. Our principal customers (non-affiliated) are: 
 Mortgage originators such as mortgage banks, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks; 
 Aggregators, issuers and investors in RMBS, whole loans and other mortgage-related debt instruments, including the GSEs, private equity and hedge funds, real estate investment trusts and investment banks; 
 Single-family rental warehouse lenders, owner/operators, builders, capital markets institutional investors and securitization issuers; 
 Mortgage servicers; 
 Real estate brokers and agents; and 
 Consumers. 
 Our customers include many of the largest financial institutions and participants in the mortgage sector and, as such, our services revenue is concentrated among our largest customers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the top 10 homegenius customers generated approximately 57 of the homegenius segment s services revenue. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on establishing, maintaining and growing valuable customer relationships. Given the range of solutions we offer across our businesses, we believe we have opportunity to expand our sales to our existing customer base as well as to new customers. We have a core team of account managers who sell all products and solutions across our businesses, as well as sales teams with subject matter expertise in particular services and the related needs of the customers we serve. 
 Marketing and communications activities include direct marketing; print and digital advertising; digital marketing including email, web, content and social media; public relations and thought leadership; brand strategy and expression; event marketing including customer meetings, conferences and trade shows and other targeted initiatives designed to generate new sales opportunities, drive customer adoption of our services and retain our existing customers. We continue to adapt our sales and marketing efforts based on the current environment to offer tools and techniques to connect virtually and engage with current and potential customers.

All sales and marketing efforts are supported by functional areas that provide additional touch points for our customers. For example, our Inside Sales Team is responsible for managing and growing customer relationships and promoting increased customer adoption and our Client Success, Customer Service and Training Teams provide customized service as well as educational sessions to our customers. 
 We expect that our approach to selling our products across our mortgage and real estate services businesses will strengthen our relationships with customers, attract new customers and enhance our ability to compete. 
 
 Investment Policy and Portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio is our primary source of claims paying resources and also impacts our earnings. We seek to manage our investment portfolio within our targeted risk and return tolerances based on our current liability projections and business and economic outlook to maintain sufficient liquidity levels to satisfy our current and future operating requirements and other financial needs. 
 Our investment strategy uses an asset allocation methodology that takes into consideration regulatory constraints, our business environment and consolidated risks as well as current investment conditions. With respect to our fixed income investments, the following internal investment policy guidelines, among others, are applied at the time of investment and continually monitored. 
 Internal investment policy guidelines NAIC Designation Ratings Equivalent Internal Policy 1 A- and above At least 75 of the portfolio Fair Value 2 BBB+ to BBB- Not more than 25 of portfolio Fair Value 3 to 6 BB+ and below Not more than 10 of portfolio Fair Value 
 Our portfolio has been constructed to maximize long-term expected returns while maintaining an acceptable risk level. Our investment objectives are to utilize appropriate risk management oversight to optimize after-tax returns, while preserving capital. We calibrate the level of our short-term investments based on our overall investment portfolio duration, risk appetite and expected short-term cash requirements. 
 Our investment policies and strategies are subject to change, depending on business needs and regulatory, economic and market conditions and our then-existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including our current and future tax positions. The investments held at our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to insurance regulatory requirements applicable to such insurance subsidiaries. For example, regulatory requirements address the types of assets that may be reported as admitted assets for statutory reporting purposes and limit how a mortgage insurer may invest its contingency reserve. 
 Oversight responsibility of our investment portfolio rests with management, and allocations are set by periodic asset allocation studies, calibrated by risk and after-tax return considerations. The risks we consider include, among others, duration, convexity, liquidity, market, sector, structural, interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2022, we internally managed 10 of the investment portfolio (the portion of the portfolio largely consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds, equities, mortgage insurance-linked notes and other mortgage related assets, and certain exchange-traded funds), with the remainder primarily managed by three external managers. External managers are selected by management based primarily upon their ability to meet our investment goals and objectives, based upon factors such as historical returns and the stability of their management teams. Management s selections of external managers are presented to, approved and monitored by the Finance and Investment Committee of our board of directors. 
 At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio, including securities loaned to third-party borrowers under securities lending agreements, had a cost basis of 6.4 billion and a carrying value of 5.8 billion. At December 31, 2022, 95 of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade. The weighted-average duration of the assets in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022, was 4.4 years. For additional information about our investment portfolio, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Investment Portfolio, as well as Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Although managed separately from the investment portfolio discussed above, beginning in 2022, we also purchase mortgage loans for resale in our new mortgage conduit. See All Other Overview for additional information on this business. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see We face risks associated with our new mortgage conduit business.

Enterprise Risk Management 
 Risk Philosophy, Vision and Appetite 
 As a financial services organization, risk management is a critical part of our business. The following goals guide our strategy and actions as a risk management organization: 
 Embed and continually reinforce a disciplined, corporate-wide risk culture that utilizes an understanding of risk/return trade-offs to drive quality decisions and achieve long-term, through-the-cycle profitability; 
 Maintain credit, underwriting, pricing and risk/return disciplines based on sound data and analytics and continuous feedback throughout the organization; 
 Proactively monitor business, counterparty, economic, housing and regulatory trends to identify and mitigate emerging risks; 
 Continually refine analytical and technological capabilities, processes and systems to effectively identify, assess and manage risks; and 
 Develop and leverage tools and capabilities to inform and optimize capital allocation within our risk appetite in support of our corporate strategy. 
 Risk Categories 
 Our risk appetite, or the amount of risk we are willing to take on in pursuit of value, is driven by our business strategy, which is established by executive management and overseen by our board of directors. We define our risk appetite qualitatively through the following key risk categories where strategic execution occurs: credit; financial; strategic; operational and regulatory and compliance. We do not treat reputational risk as a distinct category of risk; rather, we view reputational risk as pervasive throughout our entire risk portfolio, as each risk on its own can impact our reputation if not mitigated or managed properly. 
 Risk Governance 
 Board of Directors 
 Our board of directors is responsible for the general oversight of risks. Our board of directors seeks to understand and oversee the most critical risks relating to our business, allocates responsibilities for the oversight of risks among the full board and its committees, and reviews the systems and processes that management has in place to manage identified risks, as well as those that could arise in the future. 
 The board regularly meets with management to receive reports derived from: (i) our ERM function regarding the most significant risks we are facing, and the steps being taken to assess, manage and mitigate those risks; (ii) our information security function regarding cybersecurity risks and our efforts to mitigate such risks; and (iii) our compliance programs and our efforts to embed a culture of compliance throughout the organization to encourage ethical behavior and mitigate risks of regulatory non-compliance. The full board further considers current and potential future strategic risks as part of its annual strategic planning session with management. 
 Executive Management 
 Our senior executive management team regularly monitors and discusses risks related to our businesses through various management committees. Our Pricing and Risk Committee, Capital and Liquidity Review Committee and Model Governance Committee (these committees collectively comprise our Asset Liability Committee) focus on identifying risks and decision making related to pricing, credit, capital, liquidity and model risk management, including risk/return analysis associated with different business opportunities. Other management committees focused on risk management include, but are not limited to, our ERM Council, Executive Information Security Committee, Resilience Executive Committee and Enterprise Information Governance Committee. 
 Integrated ERM Framework 
 We have adopted an integrated approach to risk management, which includes, among other things: (i) a centralized ERM function that is responsible for overseeing the process for risk identification, assessment, management and mitigation across the organization; (ii) risk management functions embedded in our businesses; (iii) specialized risk committees with a focus on specific risks; and (iv) an internal audit function that performs periodic, independent reviews and tests compliance with risk management policies, procedures and standards across the Company. 
 Our ERM framework is designed to provide executive management with the ability to identify and evaluate the most significant risks we face and to calibrate risk mitigation strategies to account for challenges in the current business environment, as well as external factors that may negatively impact our operations. In practice, our ERM function represents a cross-functional and enterprise-wide effort, consisting of subject matter experts and experienced managers, that utilizes a 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1. Business 

systematic method to identify, evaluate and monitor both known and emerging risks. Risk assessments and mitigation plans are developed to address these risks. Risk scoring and validation of the effectiveness of risk management plans through management reporting facilitate program sustainability and promote accountability for risk management activities throughout the Company. 
 As part of our ERM program, our businesses employ comprehensive risk management functions, which, in conjunction with the oversight of the Risk Committee of our board of directors, are responsible for monitoring compliance with our risk-related policies, managing our insured portfolios and the mortgage loans we purchase through our mortgage conduit and communicating credit-related issues to management, our board of directors and our customers. 
 Mortgage Insurance Risk Management 
 Risk Origination and Servicing. We believe that understanding our business partners and customers is a key component of managing risk. Accordingly, we have a counterparty risk management team that leverages our customer and servicer segmentation framework so that we can more effectively perform ongoing monitoring of loan performance, underwriting quality and the risk profile and mix of business of a customer s mortgage insurance applications. The counterparty risk management team monitors trends at the customer level, identifies customers who may exceed certain risk tolerances and shares meaningful performance data with our customers to help them improve. The team is also responsible for lender corrective action in the event we discover credit performance issues, such as high early payment default levels. 
 Portfolio Management. We have developed risk and capital allocation models to support our mortgage insurance business. These models provide comprehensive analytics that help us establish portfolio limits for product type, loan attributes, geographic concentrations and counterparties. We proactively monitor market concentrations across these and other attributes. We also identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions for terminating insurance risk and for distributing risk to third parties, including through reinsurance arrangements. See Risk Distribution below for more information about the use of reinsurance as a risk management tool in our mortgage insurance business. As part of our portfolio management function, we monitor and analyze the performance of various risks in our mortgage insurance portfolio. We use this information to develop our mortgage credit risk and counterparty risk policies, and as a component of our default and prepayment analytics. 
 Credit Policy. We maintain mortgage-related credit risk policies that reflect our tolerance levels regarding counterparty, portfolio and operational risks involving mortgage collateral. Based on our policies and risk tolerances, our credit policy function develops and updates our mortgage insurance eligibility requirements and guidelines through regular monitoring of competitor offerings, customer input regarding lending needs, analysis of historical performance and portfolio trends, quality assurance results and underwriter experience and observations. The credit policy function works closely with our mortgage insurance underwriters to ensure that underwriting decisions align with risk tolerances and principles. 
 Quality Assurance. Our quality assurance function supports our credit analytics function by auditing individual loan files to examine underwriting decisions for compliance with agreed-upon underwriting guidelines. These audits are conducted across loans submitted through our delegated and non-delegated underwriting channels. Our quality assurance team also audits our customers and our underwriters to monitor quality in our NIW. We conduct independent re-verification of key mortgage insurance application data to protect against misrepresentation. Our quality assurance team also conducts audits of our key operational functions, including claims, premium processing and customer care to ensure that our operational transactions are in compliance with our policies and procedures. 
 Loss Mitigation. We have a dedicated loss mitigation group that works with servicers to identify and pursue loss mitigation opportunities for loans in both our performing and non-performing (defaulted) portfolios. This includes regular surveillance and benchmarking of servicer performance with respect to default reporting, borrower retention efforts, foreclosure alternatives and foreclosure processing. Through this process, we seek to hold servicers accountable for their performance and communicate to servicers identified best practices for servicer performance. See Mortgage Defaults and Claims Claims Management above for more information. 
 Risk Modeling. Our risk modeling team uses analytical techniques to develop and maintain economic scenario generation models and loan level default and prepayment models for a wide range of risk management applications, including portfolio analysis, credit decision making, forecasting and loss reserving. 
 Risk Distribution. In our mortgage insurance business, we use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool to lower the risk profile and financial volatility of our mortgage insurance portfolio through economic cycles. We have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, including through the capital markets using mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions. In recent years, we have expanded our risk distribution strategy in an effort to optimize the amounts and types of capital and risk distribution deployed against insured risk. The objectives of our risk distribution strategy include: (i) supporting our overall capital plan by reducing our cost of capital, increasing capital efficiency and enhancing our projected returns on capital and (ii) reducing portfolio risk and financial volatility through economic cycles. For additional information regarding our reinsurance programs, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Title Insurance Risk Management 
 We take a prudent approach to assessing and managing risk in our title insurance business through the use of well-trained underwriters, stringent underwriting guidelines and the imposition of per file risk limits and third-party reinsurance on a per policy basis, over certain policy limits. 
 Underwriting and Quality Assurance. Our agents, underwriters and title examiners receive training and feedback in the examining and underwriting of residential and commercial title insurance for both refinance and purchase transactions. Specific title commitments are selected for further review to ensure that underwriting decisions comply with agreed-upon underwriting guidelines and that the policies are within single risk limits. 
 Credit Policy. We have developed and maintain policies for our title insurance business, which reflect our risk tolerance levels. Risk limits are imposed on selected loan types and reinsurance is currently required on all policies with loan amounts above a specified amount. 
 Ceded Reinsurance. In our title insurance business, we use reinsurance as part of our capital and risk management activities, including a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement that transfers a portion of the risk associated with the legacy title insurance in our portfolio (insurance written prior to the acquisition of our title insurance subsidiary) to a third party. We also currently maintain an excess-of-loss policy with a third-party reinsurer that covers losses on our entire title insurance legacy portfolio above a specified limit. 
 Mortgage Conduit Risk Management 
 Credit Policy. Our risk management team reviews and approves new mortgage conduit loan programs, underwriting guideline changes and mortgage seller underwriting programs. Mortgage conduit loan programs are reviewed frequently and updated as needed to address changing market conditions and other factors. 
 Counterparty Risk. We maintain mortgage seller approval and recertification policies to evaluate and monitor, among other things, seller creditworthiness, capacity, and quality. Mortgage seller financial and other trends are also monitored, and appropriate mitigation actions are taken as warranted. Our counterparty risk management team has also developed risk thresholds for our mortgage conduit business that align with the Company s overall risk and return tolerances. 
 Quality Assurance. Our quality assurance function audits individual loan files purchased by Radian Mortgage Capital to assess compliance with the applicable underwriting guidelines and regulatory compliance requirements. We conduct independent re-verification of key credit file data to protect against misrepresentation. 
 Secondary Marketing. We have a control framework with established standards, parameters and practices that apply to the purchase and sale of mortgage loan products by Radian Mortgage Capital. The controls are aligned with the Company s risk and return tolerances through established authority levels, escalation triggers and governance over target pricing, margin limits, risk position limits and trade size limits. This framework governs Radian Mortgage Capital s day-to-day management of market risk within profitability targets of its residential mortgage loan pipeline and ensures that Radian Mortgage Capital maintains a hedge coverage that is within the Company s approved parameters. 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management 
 Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions such as Radian and includes the risk of loss resulting from cyberattacks. In an effort to mitigate this risk, we have an Information Security Program that is dedicated to protecting our corporate data as well as data entrusted to us by our customers and partners. At the core of our program is a defense-in-depth strategy, which utilizes multiple layers of security controls to protect data and solutions. 
 We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (the NIST CSF ), as a guideline to manage our cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST CSF outlines information security measures and controls over five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. We have developed key security services, including Enterprise Data Protection, Vulnerability Management and Application Security, Managed Threat Detection and Incident Response. We test our incident response readiness and reporting through tabletop exercises, external and internal penetration testing and continuous internal security testing in our efforts to ensure that risks and incidents are identified, escalated and communicated for appropriate remediation activities to reduce risk to an acceptable level. 
 Our commitment to our Information Security Program extends across all business lines. We have an Information Security Committee comprised of Company executives, cross-functional Incident Response teams and strong governance mechanisms designed to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see We could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems, or of our third-party vendors or service providers, is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including personally identifiable information that we maintain .

Human Capital Management 
 For 45 years at Radian, our products and services have responsibly helped millions of families achieve their dream of homeownership. This company-wide commitment to affordable, sustainable and equitable homeownership, along with our support of our customers, our employees and the communities where we live and work, defines who we are as an enterprise and aligns with our core organizational values: Deliver the Brand Promise, Innovate for the Future, Create Shareholder Value, Our People are the Difference, Do What s Right and Partner to Win. 
 We value our employees by supporting a healthy work-life balance and a team-oriented, One Radian environment. We strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits programs as well as career development opportunities, while fostering a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work and is encouraged to give back to their communities to make a social impact. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,400 employees of Radian Group and its subsidiaries. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Current Operating Environment for steps taken in 2022 to align our workforce to the needs of the business. 
 Compensation and Benefits Program 
 Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and reward talented individuals from diverse backgrounds who possess the skills and qualities necessary to support our business objectives, demonstrate our values, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. Our compensation programs include base salary, annual incentive bonuses and for certain employees, other performance-related cash incentives, such as commissions, and long-term equity incentive awards. 
 Our annual short-term incentive or bonus program is designed and approved by the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee of our board of directors to incent achievement of our financial objectives and execution of our strategic plan in alignment with our organizational values. Living our values and advancing our human capital management capabilities are considered as part of our employees performance evaluations and are taken into consideration in determining each employee s annual short-term incentive award. 
 In addition to our cash and equity compensation programs, we offer eligible employees a comprehensive benefits package, including, among others, life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, fertility assistance, paid parental leave and caregiver leave, a 401(k) plan with an employer matching contribution and tuition reimbursement. In addition, in order to support our employees and advance our mission to promote affordable, sustainable and equitable homeownership, we offer all eligible employees benefit reimbursements in our Radian mortgage insurance, title and agent referrals programs via our homebuyer perks benefits program. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 At Radian, we are committed to an inclusive and diverse workplace, as represented by our Employee Value Promise We See You at Radian. We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. 
 We have an established Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DEI Council that is sponsored by our CEO, led by senior management and comprised of leaders and employees from across the Company to advance the program and its efforts. In 2020, we created a framework for and launched Radian s Employee Resource Group ERG program, which is an important aspect of Radian s DEI efforts because it not only creates inclusive communities where employees feel support, but it enriches our overall company culture. Radian currently has four active ERGs: TrueColors, which brings together our LGBTQIA+ employees and allies; Women Heard as our women s group; Vibrant Crossroads, which highlights intersectionality and multiculturalism; and Radian Salutes, supporting veterans, military service members, and military dependents. 
 In January 2022, we began working with Neurodiverse Solutions NDS, formerly Autism2Work). Through the NDS program, 48 of our team members have been certified in Neurodiversity Sensory Awareness Training and we currently employ 11 neurodivergent resources within our quality assurance, risk governance and user acceptance review teams within our mortgage insurance business. 
 We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities and promoting inclusive hiring practices, developing targeted recruitment strategies and improving internal reporting capabilities. In 2020, we trained all managers on unconscious bias and, in 2021, we hired a recruiter dedicated to DEI. We annually deploy mandatory DEI training for all employees. We also annually complete pay equity analyses in partnership with an external expert to ensure an objective review of our pay practices. 
 We are committed to enhancing our DEI maturity and have developed a DEI roadmap to execute our multi-year DEI strategy. We report on our progress against the roadmap to our workforce on a quarterly basis. 
 We know that advancing a culture of inclusion takes every single employee. In 2022, we instituted an annual requirement for all employees to include a DEI objective as part of their annual performance goals, which serve as a basis for their short-

term incentive award. By focusing all employees on the importance of our DEI efforts, we can continue to advance a culture of inclusion and respect. 
 Radian s DEI efforts have received recognition from a variety of third-party organizations. Radian was recently designated as a Champion of Board Diversity by The Forum of Executive Women for the second consecutive year and was included on Bloomberg s Gender Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year. Our actions to address LGBTQIA+ equality in the workplace have been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign, and our focus on board diversity has been recognized by 50/50 Women on Boards. We also signed the Mortgage Bankers Association s Home for All Pledge to promote inclusion in housing and the CEO Action for Diversity Inclusion pledge to cultivate an environment where all ideas and employees are welcomed. 
 At December 31, 2022, women represented 56 of our workforce, 21 of the direct reports to our Chief Executive Officer and 38 of our senior management team comprising officers at the Assistant Vice President level and above. 
 Talent Development and Employee Engagement 
 We invest in our people to provide opportunities for career growth. Talent development, annual performance reviews that are focused in part on living our company values and succession planning are all important aspects of this investment. These processes help management identify and nurture top talent for leadership opportunities and support the growth and development of knowledge and skills of our employees, managers and leaders. 
 In order to measure engagement and culture across the organization, we use employee experience surveys. Our most recent employee experience survey was conducted in 2022. Our results included an 83 employee participation rate and an engagement score of 84, both higher than the benchmark 75 participation rate and 79 engagement score provided by our third-party employee engagement provider. In addition to our experience surveys, we frequently use employee pulse surveys to gather employee feedback. 
 Performance reviews are completed annually to ensure a focus on development of employees along with an assessment of performance and potential, which supports succession planning and informs development efforts across the company to ensure we have a deep bench of talent within Radian. 
 Community Involvement 
 Our financial strength and growth depend on the well-being of our employees, and therefore, the communities in which they live and we operate. Our Corporate Citizenship Program was developed to encourage and support the generosity and community involvement of our employees. Since its inception, the program through both company and employee contributions has provided significant financial support to charities across the country. The program consists of three pillars: charitable contributions, matching gifts and community connection. 
 Charitable contributions include donations made by Radian to non-profit organizations, including direct corporate contributions and sponsorship of charitable events. In 2022, we provided financial support to community organizations through direct giving, sponsorships and fundraisers. This includes a multi-year commitment to support the Mortgage Bankers Association s Opens Doors Foundation and the formation of an alliance with the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia. Our matching gifts program includes a charitable contribution made by Radian to non-profit organizations that mirrors a donation made by an employee. During 2021 and 2022, based on the struggles of many organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we raised the individual cap and doubled our matching gift program for employees to maximize their personal donations. Our community-based program, Radian Connected, provides opportunities for employee engagement and community involvement, including volunteerism and opportunities for learning and skill development, as well as social opportunities to network and build stronger working relationships. We believe that this commitment to our communities helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. 
 
 Regulation 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation by both federal and state regulatory authorities. Set forth below is a description of significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses. The descriptions below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the laws and regulations discussed. In Item 1A.

State Regulation 
 Overview of State Insurance Regulation and Our Insurance Subsidiaries 
 We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation by the insurance departments in the various states where they are licensed to transact business. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. These regulations principally are designed for the protection of policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. 
 Insurance regulations address, among other things, the licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, credit for reinsurance, premium rates and policy forms, financial statements, periodic reporting, permissible investments and adherence to financial standards relating to surplus, dividends and other measures of solvency intended to assure the satisfaction of obligations to policyholders. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must also be approved before their use. 
 With respect to mortgage insurance, premium rates may be subject to actuarial justification, generally on the basis of the mortgage insurer s loss experience, expenses and future projections. In addition, state regulators may assess how rates are being charged to various customers based on whether they are similarly situated to other customers being charged various rates, and state regulators also may evaluate general default experience in the mortgage insurance industry in assessing the premium rates charged by mortgage insurers. In many states, the filed forms allow for a deviation from the filed rates within a certain range to take into consideration various factors linked to the credit being insured. 
 As to title insurance, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and, in some states, must also be approved before their use. Policy forms require approval to ensure that the coverage and exceptions conform to state insurance regulations. Premium rates subject to approval often must be supported by actuarial data or a study of financial impact of the premium rate on the insurer. In September 2017, NYDFS issued 11 NYCRR 228 Regulation 208 which regulates title insurance marketing practices, expenses and transaction related charges in the state of New York. Regulation 208 limits or bans title underwriters and agents from charging consumers certain title- and closing-related fees, and Regulation 208 contains strict rules around marketing expenses aimed at restricting or stopping certain marketing practices in the title industry. While Regulation 208 currently is one of the most strict title marketing regulations, a number of other states impose similar restrictions on such activity, either through regulations that are specific to title marketing or through broader state insurance anti-inducement and anti-rebating laws. Radian Settlement Services and Radian Title Insurance have adjusted their transaction fees and marketing practices and expenses to comply with Regulation 208 and other similar state laws. 
 Each insurance subsidiary is required by the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile, and the insurance regulatory authority of each other jurisdiction in which it is licensed to transact business, to make various filings with those insurance regulatory authorities and with the NAIC, including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with SAP. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by the insurance regulatory authority of their state of domicile, as well as each of the states in which they are licensed to transact business. 
 Radian Group is an insurance holding company, and Radian Group s subsidiaries, including our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and title insurance company, belong to an insurance holding company system. We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Pennsylvania and Ohio because all of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Pennsylvania and Radian Title Insurance is domiciled in Ohio. These insurance holding company laws regulate, among other things, certain transactions between Radian Group, our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates. The holding company laws of Pennsylvania and Ohio also govern certain transactions involving Radian Group s common stock, including transactions that constitute a change of control of Radian Group and, consequently, a change of control of its insurance subsidiaries. Specifically, no person may, directly or indirectly, seek to acquire control of Radian Group or any of its mortgage insurance subsidiaries unless that person received prior approval after filing a statement and other documents with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department and, in the case of a change of control involving Radian Group or Radian Title Insurance, the Ohio Department of Insurance. Under Pennsylvania s and Ohio s insurance statutes, control is defined broadly and is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 or more of the voting securities of a holding company of a Pennsylvania or Ohio domiciled insurer. The statute further defines control as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an insurer. 
 In addition, transactions between any one of our insurance subsidiaries and any Radian-affiliated entity are subject to certain conditions, including that they be fair and reasonable. These conditions generally apply to all persons controlling, or who are under common control with, Radian Group and its insurance subsidiaries. Certain transactions between our insurance

subsidiaries and a Radian-affiliated entity may not be entered into unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Department or Ohio Department of Insurance, as applicable, is given 30 days prior notice and does not disapprove the transaction during that 30-day period. 
 Radian Guaranty is authorized to write insurance in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam as a monoline insurer, restricted by the laws of certain states to writing first-lien residential mortgage guaranty insurance (or in states where there is no specific authorization for mortgage guaranty insurance, the applicable line of insurance under which mortgage guaranty insurance is regulated). Radian Guaranty is our only mortgage insurance company that is currently eligible to provide first-loss mortgage insurance on GSE loans. 
 We also have the following mortgage insurance subsidiaries: Radian Insurance, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Radian Group that insures a small amount of second-lien mortgage loan risk written prior to the financial crisis; and Radian Mortgage Assurance, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Radian Group, which had no RIF as of December 31, 2022. 
 As part of our title services business, we offer title insurance through Radian Title Insurance, which we acquired in March 2018. Radian Title Insurance is an Ohio domiciled title insurance underwriter and settlement services company that is licensed to issue title insurance policies in 41 states and the District of Columbia. Radian Title Insurance is an indirect subsidiary of Radian Group and is wholly owned by Radian Title Services Inc. 
 Mortgage Insurance Capital Requirements and Dividends 
 Under state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a Statutory RBC Requirement that is based on a maximum ratio of net RIF relative to statutory capital, or Risk-to-capital. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer s Risk-to-capital may not exceed 25 to 1, while in certain other RBC States, Radian Guaranty must satisfy a MPP Requirement. As of December 31, 2022, Radian Guaranty s Risk-to-capital was 10.7 to 1, and Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on statutory capital requirements, including the NAIC s ongoing development of a revised Model Act for mortgage insurers. The ultimate outcome of the Model Act remains uncertain. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy . 
 For statutory reporting, mortgage insurance companies are required annually to set aside contingency reserves in an amount equal to 50 of earned premiums. The contingency reserve, which is designed to be a reserve against catastrophic losses, essentially restricts dividends and other ordinary distributions by mortgage insurance companies as such amounts cannot be released into surplus for a period of 10 years, except when loss ratios exceed 35 , in which case the amount above 35 can be released under certain circumstances. 
 Under Pennsylvania s insurance laws, dividends and other ordinary distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s positive unassigned surplus unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. As a result of Radian Guaranty s negative unassigned surplus position in recent years, any distributions to Radian Group required the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Radian Guaranty sought and received such approval during 2022 to return capital by paying Extraordinary Distributions to Radian Group, including a 500 million distribution in February 2022 and a 282 million distribution in December 2022. 
 In December 2022, Radian Guaranty merged with Radian Reinsurance, another wholly owned insurer of Radian Group that we previously used to participate in the credit risk transfer programs of the GSEs. As a result of this merger, Radian Guaranty went from having negative unassigned surplus to having positive unassigned surplus of 258 million as of December 31, 2022. As a result, Radian Guaranty now has the ability to pay ordinary dividends beginning in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on contingency reserve requirements and statutory dividend restrictions, as well as additional information about Radian Guaranty s merger with Radian Reinsurance. 
 Title Insurance Capital Requirements and Dividends 
 Radian Title Insurance is required to maintain Statutory Premium Reserves SPR ), calculated as a percentage of gross premiums collected. The SPR requirements are set by each state, with the most common being 7 of gross premiums collected. The SPR is then recovered based on a release schedule, amortized over 20 years. In addition to the SPR, Radian Title Insurance is subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios by the regulators in the states in which it is licensed, and these regulators can impose capital requirements on Radian Title Insurance based on the results of those ratios. 
 Under Ohio s insurance laws, dividends and other ordinary distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s positive unassigned surplus unless the Ohio Department of Insurance approves the payment of dividends or other ordinary distributions from another source. While all proposed dividends and distributions to stockholders must be filed with the Ohio Department of Insurance prior to payment, if an Ohio domiciled insurer had positive unassigned surplus, such insurer can pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10 of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders surplus or (ii) the preceding year s statutory net income, in each case without the prior approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Radian Title Insurance had negative unassigned surplus at

December 31, 2022, of 11 million, therefore it is currently unable to pay dividends or other ordinary distributions without prior approval from the Ohio Department of Insurance. 
 Other Services 
 In addition to our insurance subsidiaries, certain of our other subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the states in which they conduct their businesses, including requirements to be licensed and/or registered in these states. 
 Our real estate brokerage business conducted through homegenius Real Estate provides services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This entity, together with its agents, is required to hold licenses and conduct the brokerage business in conformity with the applicable license laws and administrative regulations of the states in which they are conducting their business. As a licensed real estate brokerage, homegenius Real Estate receives residential real estate data from various multiple listing services MLS through agreements with these MLS providers, which it uses to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of these agreements. These MLS agreements include restrictions on the permitted use of the MLS data obtained through these agreements and impose requirements on the business of real estate brokerages in order to maintain eligibility to continue to receive the MLS data. If these agreements were to be terminated or homegenius Real Estate otherwise were to lose access to this data, it could negatively impact homegenius Real Estate s ability to conduct its business. 
 Radian Mortgage Capital is a mortgage conduit formed to provide residential mortgage lenders with an additional secondary-market option to sell eligible loans to and ultimately to provide mortgage investors with another known sponsor of private label securitizations. Subject to market conditions, Radian Mortgage Capital acquires residential mortgage loans, which Radian Mortgage Capital expects to then distribute into the capital markets through private label securitizations or sell directly to mortgage investors, with the option to retain and manage structured components of the underlying credit risk. As of December 31, 2022, Radian Mortgage Capital had purchased an immaterial amount of loans and has not yet conducted any securitizations. Radian Mortgage Capital is licensed in 48 states and the District of Columbia and positioned to purchase and hold residential mortgages and servicing rights on a nationwide basis. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business subject us to additional risks and uncertainties. 
 Radian Lender Services LLC provides third-party mortgage underwriting and mortgage processing services to lenders. This entity and its employees who provide these services are required to comply with the SAFE Act in all jurisdictions where they provide these services. Both the entity and the employees are currently compliant under the SAFE Act for underwriting in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and for loan processing requirements in 45 states and the District of Columbia. See Federal Regulation The SAFE Act. 
 Radian Settlement Services and its subsidiaries provide title and escrow services, and these entities are required to hold licenses in the jurisdictions where they operate their business. Title insurance agency and escrow licensing is primarily regulated by states in which the services are being offered, with licensing and registration typically within the jurisdiction of each state s department of insurance. Radian Settlement Services is domiciled and licensed in Pennsylvania as a resident title insurance agency and, together with its subsidiaries, is licensed in 42 states and the District of Columbia. 
 Radian Valuation Services LLC is an appraisal management company, licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, that supports certain valuation services provided by homegenius Real Estate. Real estate appraisal management statutes and regulations vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine companies and enforce rules. While these businesses are generally state regulated, the Dodd-Frank Act established minimum requirements to be implemented by states regarding the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies. Most states have based their legislation on model legislation developed by the Appraisal Institute for the registration and oversight of appraisal management companies. 
 Information Security 
 The NYDFS has adopted cybersecurity regulations known as Part 500 that apply to all financial institutions and insurance companies licensed under the New York Banking, Insurance, and Financial Services Laws, including Radian Guaranty and certain of our other subsidiaries. The regulations require covered entities to, among other things: establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing the cybersecurity program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by, third parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. On November 9, 2022, NYDFS announced proposed updates to Part 500 that include enhanced governance requirements, stricter access controls, and additional notification, reporting and other requirements. In 2017, the NAIC issued an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which was modelled after Part 500, and which several states have adopted. The stated intention of that model law is that if a covered insurance company is compliant with Part 500, it also would be in compliance with the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law.

Privacy 
 The State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA that applies to any company that does business in California and meets certain threshold requirements. We believe Radian Group and certain of its affiliates may be deemed covered businesses under the CCPA. 
 The CCPA imposes a privacy framework for covered businesses that collect, sell or disclose personal information of California consumers. Companies subject to the CCPA are required to establish procedures to enable them to comply with a California consumer s data privacy rights, including by disclosing the privacy practices of the entity and responding to consumer requests within prescribed timeframes. The CCPA provides a private right of action for data breaches, including statutory or actual damages, and public enforcement by the California Attorney General for other violations. 
 On January 1, 2023, California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), which amended the CCPA to enhance certain of the privacy protections for California consumers that were created by the CCPA. The enhancements include imposing additional compliance obligations for covered entities and removing certain exemptions previously available under the CCPA. While the California Attorney General retains civil enforcement authority, the CPRA also created the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law. 
 Other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, have recently passed consumer privacy laws which are similar to the CCPA as they afford residents of those states a number of data privacy rights. Additionally, many states have enacted privacy and information practices laws that apply to insurance companies. 
 We have policies and procedures in place to comply with the CCPA and other currently applicable state privacy laws. In addition, several other states have also proposed new privacy laws, and federal regulators have proposed draft federal privacy legislation, all of which, to the extent they are adopted, could impose additional compliance obligations on covered entities beyond those currently in effect and could impact our businesses or those of our customers. 
 Federal Regulation 
 CARES Act 
 Following the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been a number of governmental efforts to implement programs designed to assist individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 virus, including the CARES Act that was enacted on March 27, 2020. 
 Under the CARES Act, upon request by borrowers of federally backed mortgage loans who attest to financial hardship related to the pandemic, mortgage servicers are required to provide these borrowers with up to 180 days forbearance on their mortgage payments, which may be extended for an additional 180 days upon request, without requiring validation by the borrowers of their hardship. The permissible forbearance period of 12 months under the CARES Act has been extended by various federal agencies and the length of the currently available forbearance period may vary depending on the agency and type of mortgage at issue. The CARES Act provides no explicit end date for when the 180 days forbearance must initially be offered; however, it is possible that the requirements under the CARES Act may be interpreted to expire on, or shortly after, the declared COVID-19 national emergency ends, which is currently expected to occur on May 11, 2023. 
 The GSEs have announced that, at the end of a forbearance plan, the homeowner may not be required to pay back their reduced or suspended mortgage payments in one lump sum, but may be eligible for a number of different options offered by their mortgage servicer, including repayment plans, resuming normal payments or lowering the monthly loan payment through a modification. For additional information on the potential impacts of the CARES Act on the GSEs, loan servicers and our PMIERs financial requirements, in Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity , Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses , and Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing . 
 GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility 
 As the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans, and therefore the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the GSEs impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy in order to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. The PMIERs aim to ensure that approved insurers will possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as strong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer of GSE loans, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer s financial condition. The PMIERs contain extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of our mortgage insurance business, including operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs.

 Part I. Item 1. Business 

The PMIERs financial requirements require that a mortgage insurer s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs financial requirements include increased financial requirements for defaulted loans (as further discussed below), as well as for performing loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO credit scores. In addition, the PMIERs financial requirements also impose limitations on the credit that is granted for certain Available Assets. For example, the PMIERs limit the amount of credit given to surplus notes issued by a mortgage insurer to 9 of Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs also prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include, among other things, entering into various intercompany agreements, settling loss mitigation disputes with customers and commuting risk. 
 With respect to defaulted loans, the PMIERs recognize that loans that have become non-performing as a result of a FEMA Declared Major Disaster eligible for individual assistance (e.g., due to a natural disaster) generally have a higher likelihood of curing following the conclusion of the event, and therefore applies a Disaster Related Capital Charge for a period of time and subject to certain limitations, to reduce the Minimum Required Asset factor for these loans. Under the PMIERS, for defaulted loans located in a FEMA Declared Major Disaster area that either (1) are subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to the disaster (with terms consistent with forbearance plans offered by the GSEs) or (2) have an initial missed monthly payment occurring 30 days prior to the first day of the incident period specified in the Major Disaster Declaration or 90 days following the last day of the incident period specified in the Major Disaster Declaration (not to exceed 180 days from the first day of the incident period), the Disaster Related Capital Charge will be applied for the longer of three calendar months beginning with the month when the loan became a defaulted loan or the period of time that the defaulted loan remains subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to the disaster. 
 In addition, in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GSEs issued guidelines National Emergency Guidelines that became effective June 30, 2020, and, among other things, adopted the COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs to apply the Disaster Related Capital Charge nationwide to certain non-performing loans that we refer to as COVID-19 Defaulted Loans, which comprise non-performing loans that either: (i) had an Initial Missed Payment occurring during the COVID-19 Crisis Period (which expired as of March 31, 2021) or (ii) are subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19. Under the COVID-19 Amendment, the Disaster Related Capital Charge currently is applied to COVID-19 Defaulted Loans for the period of time that the loan is subject to a forbearance plan, repayment plan or loan modification trial period granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19. Further, when the National Emergency Guidelines and the COVID-19 Amendment are terminated, the Disaster Related Capital Charge would then be applied to defaulted loans in accordance with the PMIERs provision pertaining to loans that have become non-performing as a result of a FEMA Declared Major Disaster, to the extent the state where the property is located is continuing to consider COVID-19 a FEMA Declared Major Disaster eligible for Individual Assistance. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Mortgage. 
 The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs and may amend the PMIERs at any time, although the GSEs have communicated that for material changes, including large-scale material changes affecting Minimum Required Assets, they will generally provide written notice 180 days prior to the effective date and engage in a discussion and comment process with the private mortgage insurers regarding the proposed changes prior to finalizing them. The most recent large-scale revisions to PMIERs became effective on March 31, 2019, and the PMIERs have been further updated on occasion since then to address various specific matters, including the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently to amend certain provisions of the PMIERs relating to corporate governance, the foreclosure bidding process and certain calculations included in each mortgage insurer s operational scorecard. 
 It is possible that the GSEs may seek to amend the PMIERs in the future to better align the financial requirements of the PMIERs with the capital requirements for the GSEs set forth in the ERCF. See Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices below for additional information on the ERCF. 
 As part of our capital and risk management activities, including to manage Radian Guaranty s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements, we have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, including through the capital markets using insurance-linked-notes transactions. The initial and ongoing credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for these risk distribution transactions is subject to the periodic review of the GSEs and could be influenced by the ERCF, which provides the GSEs with a reduced amount of credit for their own credit risk transfer activities. 
 In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity . 
 Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices 
 Legislative Reform 
 The federal government plays a significant role in the U.S. housing finance system through, among other things, the involvement of the FHFA and GSEs, the FHA and the VA. The GSEs charters, which cannot be altered outside of federal legislation, generally prohibit them from buying low down payment mortgage loans without certain forms of credit enhancement, the most common form of which has been private mortgage insurance.

 Part I. Item 1. Business 

Since FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs in September 2008, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. While many legislative proposals have been debated and occasionally advanced through various legislative procedures, no reform proposal has reached an advanced legislative stage. As a consequence, most reform-related actions with respect to the housing finance system have occurred administratively through regulatory actions. 
 Administrative Reform 
 The executive branch of the government (the Administration ), typically through its departments and regulatory agencies, offers perspectives on the future of housing finance in the U.S., including objectives for future strategic direction and areas of focus. As a result, a change in Administration can significantly alter the strategic direction of housing finance in the U.S. 
 Although many departments or agencies impact housing finance in some manner, the most prominent and directly impactful are the FHFA, HUD, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Treasury and the CFPB. In June 2021, following a Supreme Court decision that determined that the FHFA director may be removed by the President other than for cause, President Biden removed the FHFA director appointed by President Trump and appointed Sandra Thompson, who has since been confirmed as director of the FHFA. Director Thompson has taken a number of actions that represent a change in focus from the previous FHFA leadership s primary focus on preparing the GSEs to exit from conservatorship by increasing the GSEs overall capital levels and reducing their credit risk profile. In contrast, under Director Thompson, the FHFA has been focused on increasing the equitable accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit, in particular to low- and moderate-income borrowers and underserved communities, while also continuing to ensure the safety and soundness of the GSEs. The Supreme Court s decision providing that the FHFA director may be removed by the President without cause creates a higher likelihood that the direction of the FHFA and its oversight over the GSEs may be impacted by elections and the political leanings of the Administration in office at the time than previously was the case. 
 Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. The Treasury currently owns the preferred stock of the GSEs pursuant to the terms of PSPAs, and therefore, has significant influence over the fate and direction of the GSEs. In January 2021, the PSPAs were amended to allow the GSEs to continue to retain capital up to the amounts prescribed in the newly revised GSE capital requirements set forth in the ERCF, as discussed below. 
 The January 2021 amendment to the PSPAs restricted the GSEs acquisition of higher-risk single-family mortgage loans, including in particular the acquisition of investor loans and single-family mortgage loans with two or more higher risk characteristics (i.e., LTVs greater than 90 , debt-to-income ratios greater than 45 and FICO credit scores less than 680), to their then current levels. The January 2021 PSPA amendment further restricted the quality of loans that may be purchased by the GSEs by limiting the GSEs purchases to, among other enumerated types, loans that meet the QM definition. In September 2021, Treasury and the FHFA agreed to temporarily suspend the limitations on GSE purchases of loans deemed higher risk that were set forth in the January 2021 amendments to the PSPAs. 
 Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework. Between 2020 and 2022, the FHFA advanced certain initiatives to develop new capital and liquidity requirements for the GSEs, and in February 2022, the FHFA announced a final ERCF, which, as compared to the capital requirements for the GSEs in place prior to the ERCF: (i) significantly increased such capital requirements and (ii) decreased the capital credit provided to the GSEs for credit risk transfer transactions. In addition, the FHFA has proposed new minimum liquidity requirements for the GSEs, which have not been finalized. 
 The ERCF and the proposed new liquidity requirements could significantly alter the business practices and operations of the GSEs and potentially have a material effect on the conventional mortgage market and our business with the GSEs. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses. 
 Access and Affordability. The Biden Administration has proposed a housing plan focused on: (i) increasing access to sustainable homeownership and making housing more affordable for low- and moderate-income borrowers; (ii) ensuring the housing finance system is equitable by identifying and eliminating discriminatory or unfair practices in the housing system; (iii) increasing the supply, lowering the cost and improving the quality of housing, including through investments in resilience, energy efficiency, and accessibility of homes; and (iv) providing financial assistance to help Americans buy or rent safe, quality housing, including down payment assistance. 
 Since assuming leadership over the FHFA in June 2021, in addition to amending the PSPAs and finalizing the ERCF, the Biden-appointed FHFA leadership team has instituted changes to further advance mortgage access and affordability. In June 2022, the FHFA announced the release of the GSEs Equitable Housing Finance Plans, providing a framework for planned initiatives to address equity in housing finance. These plans note various initiatives through 2024 that aim to address barriers to homeownership for minority and underserved communities. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s plans include a particular focus on Special Purpose Credit Programs SPCPs ), with both GSEs expected to launch programs. While details on any future changes remain uncertain, both Fannie Mae s and Freddie Mac s plans note that these programs could consider modifications to mortgage insurance requirements. Specifically relating to mortgage insurance, (1) Fannie Mae s plan contemplates the creation of SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers with a goal of lowering costs for such

borrowers through lower than standard mortgage insurance requirements; and (2) Freddie Mac s plan contemplates the creation of SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers with the goals of (a) working with mortgage insurers to reduce costs for high LTV borrowers, and (b) updating mortgage insurance cancellation requirements. The plans also include expected activity to address credit and alternative data in underwriting, valuations and appraisals, and title insurance, among others. The GSEs are expected to update these plans annually. 
 Radian Guaranty and other private mortgage insurance companies have been engaged in discussions with the GSEs regarding how the industry may support the GSEs to advance these objectives. Depending on the outcome of such dialogue, one or both of the GSEs, together or in conjunction with one or more private mortgage insurers, could implement further initiatives in pursuit of housing policy objectives that could require changes to the GSEs business practices and impact our businesses. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses. 
 In October 2022, the FHFA announced that the GSEs will replace their use of Classic FICO credit scores with FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 credit scores, which are intended to improve accuracy by capturing additional payment histories for borrowers when available, such as rent, utilities, and telecom payments. The GSEs will require both of the new credit scores, along with credit reports from two, rather than three, of the credit reporting agencies. The implementation timeline for the transition to the new credit scores is expected to be a multi-year effort and the timeline for ultimate implementation is uncertain. 
 Also in October 2022, the FHFA announced, among other pricing changes, an elimination of GSE loan-level pricing adjustments (upfront fees) for some first-time and low- and moderate-income borrowers, including first-time homebuyers at or below 100 of area median income AMI in most of the United States and below 120 of AMI in high-cost areas. In January 2023, the FHFA announced additional pricing changes for the GSEs, with both increases and decreases in loan-level pricing adjustments, depending on certain loan characteristics. These most recent pricing changes will be effective May 1, 2023. 
 New Products. In December 2022, the FHFA released a final rule regarding the process for how it will consider and approve new GSE activities and products. Among other things, the rule redefines the criteria for determining what constitutes a new activity that requires prior notice to the FHFA and for determining whether the activity constitutes a new product that requires public notice and comment. Given the size and market influence of the GSEs, this new rule is generally viewed as important to ensure that the GSEs are not otherwise encroaching on areas that may be more appropriately served by private capital. 
 It is difficult to predict what types of new products and activities may be proposed in the future and, if applicable, whether they may be approved by the FHFA, including programs that may provide an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance. For example, if any existing or future credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of mortgage insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced pilot programs, IMAGIN and EPMI, respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to obtain credit enhancement and sell loans with LTVs greater than 80 to the GSEs. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance was acquired directly by each GSE through entities that were not subject to compliance with the PMIERs, have many of the same features as private mortgage insurance and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. These programs experienced limited volumes and in June 2021 were discontinued for new business, although they could be relaunched in the future. 
 HUD/FHA 
 Private mortgage insurance competes for a share of the insurable mortgage market with the single-family mortgage insurance programs of the FHA, including on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. 
 While the FHA continues to insure a significant portion of the total low down-payment mortgage market, with respect to the portion of the market where private mortgage insurance and FHA s products compete, the private mortgage insurance industry has been competing effectively with FHA execution, primarily due to: (i) the financial strength of private mortgage insurers; (ii) the development of new products, pricing delivery tools and marketing efforts directed at competing with FHA programs and execution; (iii) previous increases in the FHA s pricing; (iv) the U.S. government s pursuit of legal remedies against FHA-approved lenders related to loans insured by the FHA; and (v) various policy changes at the FHA, including the general elimination of the premium cancellation provision that still exists for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance. 
 As last reported in November 2022, the FHA s Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund had a combined capital ratio for fiscal year 2022 of 11 , above the 2 ratio that the FHA is required to maintain. As discussed above, the Biden Administration has been pursuing actions that will further its stated objective of increasing access to affordable mortgages for low- and moderate-income borrowers. In this regard, on February 22, 2022, the FHA announced that it is reducing its annual mortgage insurance premium by 0.30 percentage points for most new borrowers. While we do not expect this pricing change to have a material impact on our business volumes, the FHA could institute further pricing changes in the future, including additional changes to its annual premiums, a reduction in its upfront premiums and/or the elimination of the life-of-loan premium

requirement for FHA insured loans. It is uncertain if and when the FHA may pursue any additional pricing or other actions and what form they may take; however, any change that would improve FHA execution compared to execution through the GSEs with private mortgage insurance could negatively impact our NIW volume. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Act mandates significant rulemaking by several regulatory agencies to implement its provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under federal law, including residential mortgages, and transferred authority to the CFPB to enforce many existing consumer-related federal laws, including the Truth in Lending Act and RESPA. 
 Among the most significant provisions for private mortgage insurers under the Dodd-Frank Act are the ability to repay mortgage provisions Ability to Repay Rule ), including a related safe harbor set forth in the QM Rule (defined below), the securitization risk retention provisions and the expanded mortgage servicing requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and RESPA. 
 Qualified Mortgage Requirements Ability to Repay Requirements 
 The Ability to Repay Rule requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that, at the time a loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that a creditor may presume that a borrower will be able to repay a loan if the loan has certain low-risk characteristics that meet the definition of a qualified mortgage, or QM QM Rule ). This QM presumption is generally rebuttable, however, loans that are deemed to have the lowest risk profiles are granted a safe harbor from liability QM Safe Harbor related to the borrower s ability to repay the loan. 
 In December 2020, the CFPB finalized two new definitions of QM. One of these new QM definitions (the New General QM Definition adopts a pricing-based approach to QM. Under the New General QM Definition, certain underwriting considerations are retained, but QM status generally is achieved if the loan is priced at no greater than 2.25 above the Average Prime Offer Rate APOR ). Loans priced at or less than 1.5 above APOR are subject to the QM Safe Harbor, while all other QM loans would receive the general rebuttable presumption that the loans met the ability to repay standard. 
 Separately, the CFPB created another new QM definition Seasoned QM for first-lien, fixed-rate loans that meet certain performance requirements over a 36-month seasoning period and are held in the lender s portfolio until the end of the seasoning period. After a transition period in which both the original and new QM definitions were applicable, both new QM definitions replaced the original QM definition on October 1, 2022. 
 The QM Rule requires that points and fees paid at or prior to closing cannot exceed 3 of the total loan amount, with higher points and fees thresholds provided for loan amounts below 114,847. Any mortgage insurance premiums paid by the borrower at or before the time of loan closing must be applied toward the 3 points and fee calculation, unless such premiums are in excess of the FHA upfront premium amount and are automatically refundable on a pro-rata basis. There are no similar restrictions on the points and fees associated with FHA premiums, and thus FHA has a market advantage for smaller balance loans where the 3 cap is more easily reached. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also granted the FHA, VA and USDA flexibility to establish their own QM definitions for their insurance guaranty programs. Both the FHA and VA have created their own definitions of qualified mortgages that differ from both the CFPB s original QM Definition and New General QM Definition. For example, the FHA s QM Safe Harbor definition currently applies to loans priced at or less than APOR plus the sum of 115 basis points and the FHA s annual mortgage insurance premium rate, which is effectively broader than the QM Safe Harbor adopted under the New General QM Definition. These alternate definitions of qualified mortgages are more favorable to lenders and mortgage holders than the CFPB s New General QM Definition that apply to loans purchased by the GSEs, which could drive business to these agencies and have a negative impact on our mortgage insurance business. 
 For more information regarding the CFPB s proposed New General QM Definition and the risks it may present for us, in Item 1A. Risk Factors, see A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our homegenius businesses. 
 Qualified Residential Mortgage Regulations Securitization Risk Retention Requirements 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain at least 5 of the credit risk associated with mortgage loans that they transfer, sell or convey, unless the mortgage loans are qualified residential mortgages QRMs or are insured by the FHA or another federal agency (the QRM Rule ). Under applicable federal regulations, a QRM is generally defined as a mortgage meeting the requirements of a qualified mortgage under the CFPB s QM Rule described above. Because Radian Mortgage Capital intends to conduct securitizations that include mortgage loans which are not QRMs, its securitizations will be subject to risk retention requirements. As such, for each securitization transaction, we will be required to retain at least a 5 first-loss position, or a 5 pro rata share of all securities issued or a combination of a first-loss position and pro rata share. We will be required to retain such risk for up to seven years.

 The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the FIO ). While the FIO does not have a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, such as serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. It is difficult to predict whether legislators or other executive agencies will pursue the development and implementation of federal standards for the mortgage insurance industry outside of the FHFA. Any divergence from the current system of state regulation could significantly change compliance burdens and possibly impact our financial condition. 
 In addition, Section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes minimum requirements to be implemented by states regarding the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies, including Radian Valuation Services. 
 RESPA 
 Settlement service providers in connection with the origination or refinance of a federally regulated mortgage loan are subject to RESPA and Regulation X. RESPA authorizes the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and state insurance commissioners to bring civil enforcement actions, and also provides for criminal penalties and private rights of action. 
 Mortgage insurance, title insurance and other products and services provided by Radian s affiliates are considered settlement services for purposes of RESPA. The anti-referral fee and anti-kickback provisions of Section 8 of RESPA generally provide, among other things, that settlement service providers are prohibited from paying or accepting anything of value in connection with the referral of a settlement service or sharing in fees for those services. RESPA also prohibits requiring the use of an affiliate for settlement services and requires certain information to be disclosed if an affiliate is used to provide the settlement services. In addition to mortgage insurance provided by Radian Guaranty, our homegenius businesses offer an array of services to our customers, including real estate brokerage, valuation, hybrid appraisal, title and closing services, many of which may be considered settlement services for purposes of RESPA, and therefore, may be subject to the anti-referral fee, anti-kickback and required use provisions of RESPA. RESPA also establishes a number of mortgage loan servicing requirements that apply to our mortgage conduit in connection with it acting as a master servicer with respect to the sub-servicing arrangement that has been implemented for the day-to-day servicing of loans acquired by the conduit. The mortgage loan servicing requirements relate to servicing transfers, responding to consumer information requests, resolution of notices of error, force-placed insurance, early intervention and continuity of contact with delinquent borrowers, loss mitigation, general servicing policies and procedures, escrow account maintenance and service provider oversight. 
 In the past, Radian Guaranty and other mortgage insurers have faced lawsuits alleging, among other things, that their captive reinsurance arrangements constituted unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under RESPA. We also have been subject to lawsuits alleging that our Pool Mortgage Insurance and contract underwriting services violated RESPA. In addition, we and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries and investigative demands from, and we have agreed to settlements without findings of wrongdoing with, state and federal governmental agencies, including the CFPB relating to captive reinsurance. 
 Homeowner Assistance Programs 
 The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 authorizes approximately 9.9 billion to fund a Homeowner Assistance Fund for the purpose of preventing homeowner mortgage delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, loss of utilities or home energy services, and displacements of homeowners experiencing financial hardship after January 21, 2020. Since the enactment of this legislation, Treasury has issued guidance on this program and announced allocations by state, with a statutory minimum requirement of 50 million for each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. According to the guidance issued by Treasury, eligible use of these funds may include mortgage payment assistance, assistance for housing-related costs related to a period of forbearance, delinquency, or default, facilitating mortgage interest reductions, and assistance with insurance payments, including mortgage insurance, utility and tax payments, among others. 
 The SAFE Act 
 The SAFE Act and its state law equivalents require mortgage loan originators to be licensed with state agencies in the states in which they operate and/or registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (the Registry ). The Registry is a database established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators that tracks the licensing and eligibility requirements of loan originators. Among other things, the database was established to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by each state. 
 As part of this licensing and registration process, loan originators who are employees of institutions other than depository institutions or certain of their subsidiaries that, in each case, are regulated by a federal banking agency, must generally be licensed under the SAFE Act guidelines enacted by each state in which they engage in loan origination activities and registered with the Registry. Additionally, most states define underwriting and loan processing as a clerical and administrative duty, performed under the supervision of a licensed mortgage loan originator.

Mortgage Insurance Cancellation 
 The HPA imposes certain cancellation and termination requirements for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance with respect to residential mortgage transactions as defined in the HPA, and requires certain disclosures to borrowers regarding their rights under the law. Specifically, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, the HPA provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans may be cancelled at the request of the borrower once the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 80 of the home s original value based on the loan s initial amortization schedule, or reaches 80 of the home s original value based on actual payments. 
 In addition, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, the HPA provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans is subject to servicer-initiated automatic termination once the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 78 of the home s original value based on the loan s initial amortization schedule (or, if the loan is not current on that date, on the date that the loan becomes current). The HPA further provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans is subject to final termination following the date that is the midpoint of the loan s amortization period (or, if the loan is not current on that date, on the date that the loan becomes current). 
 The HPA also provides that, in general, within 45 days after termination or cancellation of a private mortgage insurance policy in accordance with the requirements of the relevant section of the HPA, all unearned premiums for private mortgage insurance must be returned to the borrower by the servicer, and that within 30 days after notification by the servicer, a mortgage insurer that is in possession of any unearned premiums of the borrower must transfer to the servicer an amount equal to the amount of unearned premiums for repayment. 
 The HPA also establishes special rules for the termination of private mortgage insurance in connection with loans that are high risk. The HPA does not define high risk loans, but leaves that determination to the GSEs for loans up to the GSE conforming loan limits and to lenders for any other loan. For high risk loans originated in excess of conforming loan limits, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, the servicer is required to initiate termination once the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 77 of the home s original value based on the loan s initial amortization schedule. It is the servicer s obligation to verify the date when a loan meets all HPA requirements for termination of borrower-paid private mortgage insurance and to promptly instruct the private mortgage insurer to terminate coverage. 
 Although not provided in the HPA, the GSEs guidelines also currently provide that when certain conditions are satisfied, borrowers can request cancellation of borrower-paid mortgage insurance for most loans when the LTV, based upon the current value of the home, is: either 75 or less or 80 or less, depending on the seasoning of the loan and other factors. The GSEs may change these guidelines in the future, including by expanding their mortgage insurance cancellation requirements, which could negatively impact our businesses. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses and Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. 
 The Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA 
 The FCRA imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information and disclosures that must be made to consumers when information from their credit reports is used. The FCRA has been interpreted by the Federal Trade Commission to require mortgage insurance companies to provide adverse action notices to consumers under the insurance prong of FCRA in the event an application for mortgage insurance is declined or a higher premium is charged based on the use, wholly or partly, of information contained in the consumer s credit report. 
 Privacy and Information Security Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLBA and Other Regulatory Requirements 
 As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. We and our customers are subject to a variety of privacy and information security laws and regulations. The GLBA, which consists of both a Privacy Rule and a Safeguards Rule, imposes privacy and security requirements on financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the use, re-use and sharing of such information. The GLBA is enforced by state regulators and by federal regulatory agencies. 
 In December 2021, the Federal Trade Commission updated the GLBA Safeguards Rule. The updated Safeguards Rule includes, among other things, specific requirements for risk assessments and other safeguards, such as multifactor authentication, enhanced access controls, and data inventory, classification and disposal practices. These changes go into effect on June 9, 2023. 
 In addition, many states have enacted privacy and data security laws that impose compliance obligations beyond the GLBA, such as: requiring notification in the event that a security breach results in a reasonable belief that unauthorized persons may have obtained access to consumer nonpublic personal information; imposing additional restrictions on the sharing and use of consumers personal information; affording consumers new rights of access, correction and deletion of their

personal information and rights to appeal; imposing affirmative consent and/or opt out requirements for targeted advertising and other activities; and creating new private rights of action for data breaches. See State Regulation Privacy. 
 Federal and state agencies have increased their focus on compliance obligations related to privacy, data security and cybersecurity. The CFPB, NYDFS, Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and non-governmental regulatory agencies, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), have announced new compliance measures and enforcement efforts designed to monitor and regulate the protection of personal consumer data, including with respect to: the development and delivery of financial products and services; underwriting; mortgage servicing; credit reporting; digital payment systems; and vendor management. For information regarding the NYDFS cybersecurity regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act, under State Regulation above, see Information Security and Privacy. 
 Fair Lending and Fair Servicing 
 The federal Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, makes it unlawful for any person whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to: (i) discriminate in housing-related lending activities against any person on a prohibited basis or (ii) for any person to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, to any person because of a prohibited basis. 
 Similarly, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B make it unlawful for a creditor to discriminate in any aspect of a credit transaction against an applicant on a prohibited basis during any aspect of a consumer or business credit transaction or make any oral or written statement to applicants or prospective applicants that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application. 
 These laws seek to address discrimination in lending and other housing-related activity by prohibiting discrimination that is intentional or where a facially neutral policy or practice has a disparate impact; that is, that it disproportionately excludes or burdens persons on a prohibited basis without a need to demonstrate intentional discrimination. 
 In September 2020, HUD issued a Final Rule (the 2020 Rule that modified the requirements for demonstrating disparate impact claims. Implementation of the 2020 Rule was enjoined, and it never went into effect. In June 2021, HUD published a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to rescind its 2020 Rule, which was criticized as making it more difficult to bring disparate impact claims, and restore HUD s prior interpretation of the disparate impact rule. To this end, the Biden Administration has focused heavily on discriminatory and unfair housing practices. 
 As a provider of products and services that support residential real estate transactions and the mortgage production and financing process, fair lending and servicing laws may impact the way we deliver or conduct our products and services, including in response to customer requirements. 
 Federal Consumer Protection Laws 
 As certain of our current and potential future business activities are directed at consumers or affect the provision of real estate and mortgage-related services provided to consumers by others, we may be subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, laws that could apply to us more directly. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed elsewhere in this Regulation section, these laws may include: 
 The Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, requiring disclosures of mortgage loan costs and other notices to consumers, prohibiting certain compensation to loan originators, steering and other loan origination practices, establishing a number of requirements for mortgage servicers and imposing requirements on loan owners for loan ownership transfers; 
 The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, regulating debt collection communications and other activities; 
 Prohibition on Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices, prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service; 
 CAN-SPAM Act, regulating commercial and marketing email, including the right of recipients to have the sender stop sending emails; 
 The Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Do Not Call regulations, regulating and restricts certain marketing-related phone calls, text messages and facsimiles; and 
 Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act), allowing the use of electronic records to satisfy requirements that must be provided in writing if the consumer has affirmatively consented. 
 We may also be required to comply with state laws similar to these federal consumer protection laws to the extent applicable to our businesses.

Basel III 
 Over the past few decades, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee has established international benchmarks for assessing banks capital adequacy requirements Basel III ). Included within those benchmarks are capital standards related to residential lending and securitization activity and, importantly for private mortgage insurers, the capital treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. These benchmarks are then interpreted and implemented via rulemaking by U.S. banking regulators. 
 In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations, referred to as the U.S. Basel III Rules, to implement significant elements of the Basel framework. The U.S. Basel III Rules, among other things, revise and enhance the U.S. banking agencies general risk-based capital rules. Today, the U.S. Basel III Rules assign a risk weight to loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties. Generally, under the U.S. Basel III Rules in place today, the explicit government guarantees (FHA/VA/USDA) receive a 0 risk weight, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac related loans receive a 20 risk weight. Non-government-related mortgage exposures secured by a first lien on a one-to-four family residential property that are prudently underwritten and that are performing according to their original terms receive a 50 risk weighting. All other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are assigned a 100 risk weight. 
 In December 2014, the Basel Committee issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV ratio and the borrower s ability to service a mortgage, which were not previously addressed by Basel III. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance, but in March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that for purposes of the U.S. Basel III Rules, calculation of LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in determining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50 risk weight. The comment period for this proposal closed in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee released a second proposal which retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the provisions pertaining to a borrower s ability to service a mortgage (the 2015 Basel Committee Proposal ). The comment period for the 2015 Basel Committee Proposal closed in March 2016. To date, federal regulators have not adopted or implemented any new regulations, including based on these proposals, that update or modify the U.S. Basel III Rules. 
 The revised and final recommendations from the Basel Committee with respect to Basel III were published in December 2017 (the 2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations and included finalized risk weighting guidelines for residential mortgage exposures. These rules recognize guarantees provided by sovereign governments (such as FHA, VA, USDA and Ginnie Mae) as offsetting the capital requirements, resulting in a 0 risk weight. While the 2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations include consideration of LTV ratios, including the impact of credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs on LTV ratios, the credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs would have higher risk weightings than the explicitly government guaranteed products, putting loans insured by private mortgage insurance at a disadvantage. It remains unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized in the U.S. in response to the most recent 2017 Basel III Committee Recommendations.

Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity. 
 In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including extensive risk management and operational requirements and the financial requirements discussed below. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, including the financial requirements discussed below, the GSEs could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty. 
 The PMIERs include financial requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that requires a mortgage insurer s Available Assets to meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs financial requirements include increased financial requirements for defaulted loans, as well as for performing loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO credit scores. Radian Guaranty s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by, among other factors: (i) the volume and product mix of our NIW; (ii) factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including the level of new defaults and prepayments; (iii) for existing defaults, the aging of these existing defaults and whether they are subject to, and remain in, mortgage forbearance programs, and the ultimate losses we incur on new or existing defaults; (iv) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions; and (v) potential amendments or updates to the PMIERs. If our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to the increased financial requirements under the PMIERs, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our future revenues. 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in 2020, substantially all of which related to defaults of loans subject to mortgage forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Under National Emergency Guidelines issued by the GSEs, the PMIERs apply a 0.30 multiplier to the Minimum Required Asset factor to all non-performing loans that are subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan. This effectively reduces the Minimum Required Asset amount for these loans by 70 . The application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has materially reduced Radian Guaranty s Minimum Required Assets for loans subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan; however, the benefit that Radian Guaranty is receiving as a result of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has diminished and is expected to continue to diminish over time. The reduction of this benefit could be accelerated if the GSEs were to terminate the COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs issued under their National Emergency Guidelines. 
 For more information about the application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge, see Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility. 
 If existing and future new defaults once again materially increase Radian Guaranty s Minimum Required Assets, we may be required or otherwise choose to: (i) contribute capital to Radian Guaranty; (ii) alter our strategy with respect to our NIW; or (iii) seek additional capital relief through reinsurance or otherwise, which may not be available on acceptable terms or on terms that would be approved by the GSEs. 
 The GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time and also have broad discretion to interpret the PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. The most recent large-scale revisions to PMIERs became effective in 2019, and the PMIERs have been further updated since then to address specific matters, including as part of the COVID-19 Amendment under the National Emergency Guidelines. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs in the future, including potentially to better align the PMIERs financial requirements with the increased capital requirements for the GSEs under the ERCF and/or the proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. In Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation, see GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility and Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for additional information on the ERCF and proposed GSE liquidity requirements. 
 Compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity if additional capital support for Radian Guaranty is required for Radian Guaranty to maintain compliance. The amount of capital that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty for this purpose is uncertain, but could be significant. See Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations . Further, if Radian Guaranty becomes capital constrained, as was the case in the past, it may be more difficult for Radian Guaranty to return capital to Radian Group, which would compound the negative liquidity impact to Radian Group of the contributions it may be required to make to Radian Guaranty and leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.

The PMIERs prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include, among other things, entering into certain intercompany agreements, settling loss mitigation disputes with customers and commuting risk. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or to Radian Group. 
 Loss of Radian Guaranty s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our Mortgage business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy. 
 We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of Radian Group s investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company s ability to write new business. 
 Among other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance capital requirements for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries include Risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write or the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to distribute capital to Radian Group. Similarly, our title insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory premium reserves that vary by state and are subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, the results of which could result in additional capital requirements in states where it is licensed. See Item 1. Business Regulation State Regulation for more information on existing regulatory requirements and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the NAIC s ongoing development of a revised Model Act for mortgage insurers. 
 Among other things, our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital in our mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage insurance customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty if it is not in compliance with applicable state insurance requirements. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states. For additional information about statutory surplus and other state insurance requirements, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Mortgage, as well as Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage fair competition in the insurance marketplace. We may be subject to regulatory inquiries or examinations with respect to our mortgage insurance premium rates and policy forms. Similarly, our title insurance business is subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the states in which it operates. Given that the premium rates for our insurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, we could lose business opportunities and fail to successfully implement our business strategies if our rates are deemed non-compliant or are subject to investigation, if new rates and policy forms are not approved as may be required, or if we are otherwise unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers demands in a timely and compliant manner. 
 Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses. 
 Our current business structure is highly dependent on the GSEs, as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our businesses and financial performance. Examples of potential changes that could impact our business, may include, without limitation: 
 eligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs; 
 underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase; 
 policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire; 
 the national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire; 
 the level of mortgage insurance they require; 
 47

the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law; 
 the terms required to be included in master mortgage insurance policies that cover the loans they acquire, including limitations on the ability of mortgage insurers to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default; 
 the amount of loan level price adjustments or guarantee fees, which may result in a higher cost to borrowers, that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and 
 the degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage. 
 In addition, the GSEs business practices have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support equitable access to, and affordability of, mortgage credit, in particular to low- and moderate-income borrowers and underserved communities. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices. These changes and other potential actions or inactions of the FHFA and GSEs in the future may continue to have a significant impact on the overall functioning of the housing finance system. Because traditional mortgage insurance is an important component of this system and because our businesses depend on the health of the housing finance system and housing markets in particular, these actions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our business operations and performance. 
 The structure of the residential housing finance system could be altered in the future, including as a result of comprehensive housing reform legislation. Since the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market. In conjunction with these proposals, there has been ongoing debate about the roles that the federal government and private capital should play in the housing finance system. To the extent new legislative action alters the existing GSE charters without explicit preservation of the role of private mortgage insurance for high-LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for a discussion of the future of housing finance in the U.S., including potential objectives for future reform. 
 In February 2022, the FHFA finalized the ERCF, which establishes new increased capital requirements for the GSEs, and the FHFA also has proposed new liquidity requirements for the GSEs. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for further information. Taken together, compliance with the increased capital requirements imposed by the ERCF and the proposed new GSE liquidity requirements could significantly alter the business practices and operations of the GSEs, including potentially resulting in an increase in GSE pricing and a decrease in their use of credit risk transfer. An increase in GSE pricing could make alternatives to the GSEs such as FHA insured loans or the private securitization market more attractive, which could reduce the GSEs market position and reduce the number of loans available for private mortgage insurance. Further, the GSEs may seek to amend the PMIERs financial requirements in the future, including potentially to better align with the ERCF and the proposed GSE liquidity requirements, once finalized. It remains uncertain if, when and how the PMIERs ultimately may be amended; however, changes to the PMIERs to better align with the ERCF could include: (i) an increase in the level of Radian Guaranty s required capital and (ii) a decrease in the amount of PMIERs capital relief that Radian Guaranty receives for existing or future credit risk transfer, including reinsurance or insurance-linked notes transactions. 
 The GSEs have in the past and may in the future offer new products and activities in pursuit of their business strategies, including credit risk transfer transactions and structures that compete with private mortgage insurance. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae launched pilot programs as alternatives for lenders to obtain credit enhancement and sell loans with LTVs greater than 80 to the GSEs. These programs were discontinued in 2021, but could be relaunched in the future. If these programs or any future credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to materially displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of mortgage insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for further discussion, including with respect to the recent release by the FHFA of a final rule regarding the process for how it will consider and approve new GSE activities and products. 
 Since assuming leadership over the FHFA in June 2021, the Biden Administration appointed FHFA leadership has instituted changes to further advance mortgage access and affordability, in particular to low- and moderate-income borrowers and underserved communities. Radian Guaranty and other private mortgage insurance companies have been engaged in discussions with the GSEs regarding how the industry may support the GSEs to advance their objectives. In addition, in furtherance of these policy objectives, Radian Guaranty and/or one or more of the mortgage insurers may pursue initiatives outside of their customary business activities, the success of which may be measured based on how well the initiative was able to advance accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit rather than by traditional profitability and return measures. In addition, as required by the FHFA, each of the GSEs has prepared and filed three-year Equitable Housing Finance Plans that describe each GSE s planned efforts to advance equity in housing finance, including proposals to reduce mortgage costs for historically underserved borrowers. These plans note various initiatives through 2024 that aim to address barriers to homeownership for minority and underserved communities. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s plans include a particular focus on SPCPs, with both GSEs expected to launch programs. While details on any future changes remain uncertain, both

Fannie Mae s and Freddie Mac s plans note that these programs could consider modifications to mortgage insurance requirements. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices Administrative Reform Access and Affordability for further discussion of the GSEs SPCPs. The plans also include expected activity to address credit and alternative data in underwriting, valuations and appraisals, and title insurance, among others. The GSEs are expected to update these plans annually. To implement these plans or to otherwise support the FHFA s mandate regarding increasing the accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit, the GSEs may pursue new products and activities, or alter existing policies and practices in ways that could require changes to the GSEs business practices, including in ways that could negatively impact Radian Guaranty s IIF, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Although we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, developments in the practices of the GSEs, including potentially new federal legislation, changes to existing statutes, rules or regulations, or changes in the GSEs business practices that reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, may diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Legislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses. 
 Our businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations. See Item 1. Business Regulation for a discussion of significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses. Changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, as well as changes in other laws and regulations that may affect corporations more generally, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, including changes that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time. While we have established policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many such laws and regulations are complex, and it is not possible to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on us or the industries in which we participate. 
 
 Risks Related to our Business Operations 
 Our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our mortgage insurance underwriting risks; the mortgage insurance premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured mortgage risks. We expect to incur losses for future mortgage defaults beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements. 
 The estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates in our mortgage insurance business are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premium rates are based on, among other items, our expectations about competitive and economic conditions and our cost of capital, as well as a broad range of other factors and risk attributes that we consider in developing our assumptions about the credit performance of the loans we insure and the economic benefits we expect to receive from our insurance policies. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, especially in a period of high market volatility and economic uncertainty, or if there is a change in law or the GSEs business practices that alter the performance of the loans we have insured in ways that are inconsistent with our assumptions, including the amount of premium we expect to receive from such insurance. The premium structure we apply is subject to approval by state regulatory agencies, which can delay or limit our ability to increase our premiums if further filings or approvals are necessary to institute pricing adjustments. 
 If the risk underlying a mortgage loan that we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written or if the premiums we expected to receive from such insurance are less than anticipated, whether due to a change in the GSEs business practices or otherwise. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
 From time to time, we change the processes we use to underwrite loans, including by automating certain underwriting processes and relying on information and processes of the GSEs. For example: we rely on information provided to us by lenders that was obtained from certain of the GSEs automated appraisal and income verification tools, which may produce results that differ from the results that would have been determined using different methods; we accept GSE appraisal waivers for certain refinance loans, the numbers of which have increased beginning in 2020; and we accept GSE appraisal flexibilities that allow property valuations in certain transactions to be based on appraisals that do not involve an onsite or interior inspection of the property. Our acceptance of automated GSE appraisal and income verification tools, GSE appraisal waivers and GSE appraisal flexibilities may affect our pricing and risk assessment. We also continue to further automate our 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

underwriting processes to incorporate risk-informed decision making and it is possible that our automated processes result in our insuring loans that we would not otherwise have insured under our prior processes. 
 Additionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except if a premium deficiency exists. A premium deficiency reserve would be recorded if the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premiums and already established loss reserves on the applicable loans. As future defaults are not currently reflected in our mortgage insurance loss reserves, our loss reserves could increase significantly in future periods if we experience a high volume of new defaults in future periods, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 If the estimates we use in establishing mortgage insurance loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of market volatility and economic uncertainty, such as we are currently experiencing. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. In the past, changes to our loss reserve estimates have, and could again in the future, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Although the rate of new defaults has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels and many pandemic-related defaulted loans have cured, a portion of the defaulted loans in our insured portfolio remain in COVID-19 mortgage forbearance programs. It is difficult to predict whether these loans will cure, including through modification, when forbearance ends or how many of these loans will result in a claim. 
 In addition, a portion of the defaulted loans in our insured portfolio were originated in the years prior to the financial crisis and have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults. 
 If our loss reserve estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our Loss Mitigation Activity could negatively impact our customer relationships. 
 As part of our claims management process, we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. 
 Our Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have in the past resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved all material disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could in the future have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings, requiring significant legal expenses. To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations. 
 Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses. 
 We use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool. We have distributed risk through third-party quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance arrangements, as well as through the capital markets using mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions. 
 The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions beyond our control, including factors that impact the demand of investors for mortgage credit. No assurance can be given that reinsurance will remain available to us in amounts that we consider sufficient and at rates and upon terms that we consider acceptable. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could cause us to increase the amount of risk we retain, negatively affect the returns we are able to achieve on the business we write and adversely affect our ability to write future business. Further, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to policyholders; therefore, if the reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us, we remain liable to make claims payments to our policyholders. As a result, our reinsurance arrangements do not fully eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we have assumed counterparty credit risk with respect to our inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.

We use reinsurance to manage Radian Guaranty s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements. Among other benefits, our risk distribution transactions reduce our required capital, including by significantly reducing our Required Minimum Assets under the PMIERs. The initial and ongoing credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for these risk distribution transactions is subject to the periodic review of the GSEs and could be influenced by the ERCF, which, in the form finalized in February 2022, significantly increases the capital requirements for the GSEs and provides the GSEs with a reduced amount of credit for their own credit risk transfer activities. See Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses. If the GSEs revise the PMIERs in the future to align with the final form of the ERCF, such alignment could reduce the credit that Radian Guaranty receives for reinsurance under the PMIERs, which could negatively impact our strategic approach to risk management and risk distribution. 
 In January 2023, the SEC issued a proposed rule for comment prohibiting conflicts of interest in certain securitization transactions. The proposed rule would restrict securitization participants from engaging in certain transactions with respect to an asset-backed security for a period ending one year after the initial sale of that security and also specifies certain prohibited transaction types. While we believe mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions similar to those we have used for reinsurance in the past are distinguishable from synthetic asset-backed securities contemplated by the SEC proposed rule, if the rule is adopted as proposed and is determined to apply to mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions, the rule could limit or prohibit our ability to obtain reinsurance through these transactions. 
 If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or to collect amounts due from our reinsurers, or if we receive less PMIERs capital relief for our reinsurance transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our inventory of defaulted mortgage loans may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay. 
 High levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our inventory of defaulted mortgage loans, and as a result, the Claim Severity. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the Claim Severity. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous federal and state regulatory agencies instituted borrower relief programs with the objective of supporting borrowers through the economic hardship resulting from the pandemic and allowing borrowers to remain in their homes, including mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure and eviction moratoriums. Although the foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have since expired and foreclosure filings have resumed, the existence of these moratoriums significantly impacted the claims process in 2020 and 2021 by preventing the procedural steps necessary for the filing of a claim under our insurance policies. Further, when loans subject to COVID-19 mortgage forbearance programs reach the end of their forbearance period, federal law requires servicers to discuss forbearance and loss mitigation options with their borrowers and afford additional protections to borrowers before their loans are referred to foreclosure, which further extends the period in which these loans remain in defaulted status. As a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, defaults related to the pandemic, if not cured, may remain in our defaulted loan inventory for a protracted period of time, which could result in higher levels of Claim Severity for those loans that ultimately result in a claim. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 If the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force declines, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues. 
 Most of our primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies, and as a result, a significant portion of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant driver of our future revenues, with a lower overall Persistency Rate generally reducing our future revenues. As a result, the ultimate profitability of our mortgage insurance business is affected by the impact of mortgage prepayment speeds on the mix of business we write. 
 Factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include: 
 prevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF, which affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate); 
 the HPA requirement that servicers cancel mortgage insurance when a borrower s LTV ratio meets or is scheduled to meet certain levels, generally based on the original value of the home and subject to various conditions; 
 the GSEs mortgage insurance cancellation guidelines, which apply more broadly than the HPA, and also consider a home s current value. For example, borrowers may request cancellation of mortgage insurance based on the home s current value if certain LTV and seasoning requirements are met and the borrowers have an acceptable payment history. For loans seasoned between two and five years, the LTV ratio must be 75 or less, and for loans seasoned more than 
 51 

Table of Contents

 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

five years, the LTV ratio must be 80 or less. For more information about the GSEs guidelines and business practices and how they may change, see Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses . 
 the credit policies of certain lenders, which impact the ability of homeowners to refinance loans; and 
 economic conditions that can affect a borrower s decision to pay off a mortgage earlier than required, including the strength of the housing market, which impacts a borrower s prospects for selling their existing home and finding a suitable and affordable new home. 
 If these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Recurring Premium Policies, for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims. 
 In our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and are able to terminate that lender s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims. 
 Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. 
 The U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA. 
 We currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. For more information about our competitive environment, including pricing competition, see Item 1. Business Competition. 
 Pricing strategies continue to evolve in the mortgage insurance industry. In recent years, mortgage insurers generally have migrated away from a predominantly standard rate-card-based pricing model and toward the use of proprietary, black box pricing frameworks that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple loan, borrower and property attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters. The use of these granular risk-based pricing methodologies has contributed to a pricing environment that is more dynamic with more frequent pricing changes that can be implemented quickly, as well as an overall reduction in pricing transparency. As a result, we may not be aware of rate changes in the industry until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. Further, in addition to black box pricing, industry pricing practices in recent years have also included an increased use of customized rate plans for certain customers, pursuant to which rates may be awarded to customers for only a limited period of time. The evolution of pricing strategies throughout the industry has resulted in greater volatility in our NIW and a reduction in industry pricing, including our pricing, due to the heightened competition inherent in the use of these pricing tools as compared to prior periods when standard rate cards were most prevalent. 
 Pricing has become the predominant competitive market factor for private mortgage insurance and an increasing number of customers are making their choice of mortgage insurance providers primarily based on the lowest price available for any particular loan. Our approach to pricing is customer-centric and flexible, as we offer a spectrum of risk-based pricing solutions for our customers that are designed to be balanced with our objectives for managing our volume of NIW and the risk/return profile of our insured portfolio. Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful and we may lose business to other competitors. 
 Increased pricing competition has lowered the premium yield of our insured portfolio over time as older vintage insured loans with higher premium rates run-off and have been replaced with insured loans with premium rates that generally have been lower in recent years. It is possible that pricing competition could further intensify, which could result in a decrease in our projected returns. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns. Our increased use of reinsurance over the past several years has helped to mitigate the negative effect of declining premium rates on our expected returns. However, reinsurance may not always be available or available on terms attractive to us. See Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses . 
 We also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, primarily on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. These governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility or different motivations with respect to pricing that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. On February 22, 2022, the FHA announced that it is reducing its annual mortgage insurance premium by 0.30 percentage points for most new borrowers. This pricing change and other potential future changes in pricing by these 
 52 

Table of Contents

 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

governmental entities, or to the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products, could negatively impact our ability to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation Housing Finance Reform and the GSEs Business Practices for further discussion of factors that could impact the FHA s competitive position relative to private mortgage insurance. 
 In addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. For example, alternatives to private mortgage insurance could include: investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than private mortgage insurance (or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement); lenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring; and/or lenders originating mortgages using piggyback structures to avoid private mortgage insurance. See Changes in the charters, business practices or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market generally, could significantly impact our businesses for risks related to changes in the GSEs business practices that could impact our competitive position, including the use of alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance to satisfy their charter requirements related to credit risk. 
 The competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of factors discussed above. This environment, as well as potential further changes to this evolving environment, could negatively impact our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers. 
 Our mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on mortgage loans they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of mortgage loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they conduct with us directly and their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value. 
 If we were to lose a significant customer, including as a result of customer consolidation, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer s pricing levels and pricing delivery methods, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, information security and other compliance programs, financial strength or other factors. With respect to pricing, industry pricing practices in recent years have resulted in greater volatility in our customer relationships as we may retain, gain or lose customers based on the competitiveness of our proposed pricing levels, regardless of the other factors cited above that may influence a lender s decision whether to continue or commence doing business with us. See Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition. 
 Our lending customers also may choose for risk management purposes to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that further diversification could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Finally, although we develop our product offerings and strategies to be complementary to our customers, we currently offer and may offer in the future, products that could be viewed as competitive to products offered by certain of our customers, which could influence a customer s decision as to whether to do business with us. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company. 
 Radian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of A3 by Moody s, a rating of BBB+ by S P and a rating of A- by Fitch. While Radian Guaranty s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, certain of these ratings are below the ratings assigned to some of our competitors. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, while the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs. Further, a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in increased scrutiny of our financial condition by the GSEs and/or our customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the amount of our NIW. 
 53 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We believe that financial strength ratings would represent a significant consideration for participants should they seek to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-QM loans. If the non-GSE market once again becomes receptive to the benefits of private mortgage insurance, our ability to successfully insure loans in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. 
 The rating agencies continually review the financial strength ratings assigned to Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, and the ratings are subject to change. Downgrades to the ratings of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and Radian Group could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, access to capital markets and competitive position. S P is currently reviewing its rating methodologies for insurers, including mortgage insurers. It is not possible to predict whether changes will be implemented or in what form, or what impact any potential change would have on us and on the way external parties evaluate the different rating levels. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected. 
 Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing. 
 We depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and premium payments to us and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent mortgage loans. Servicers are required to comply with a multitude of legal and regulatory requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages, such as the CFPB s mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to ensure a high level of servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. For example, the various servicing-related requirements imposed by the CARES Act, the GSEs, the FHA, CFPB and other federal and state governmental and regulatory bodies and agencies to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortgage borrowers heightened the burdens placed on servicers. Challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults make it more difficult for servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans that we insure and could influence their approach to the loans they are servicing, including by reducing their abilities or willingness to undertake mitigation efforts that could help limit our losses. 
 Information with respect to the mortgage loans we insure is based in large part on information reported to us by third parties, including the servicers and originators of the mortgage loans, and information provided may be subject to lapses or inaccuracies in reporting from such third parties. In many cases, we may not be aware that information reported to us is incorrect until such time as a claim is made against us under the relevant insurance policy. We do not receive monthly information from servicers for single premium policies, and may not be aware that the mortgage loans insured by such policies have been repaid. We periodically attempt to determine if coverage is still in force on such policies by asking the last servicer of record or through the periodic reconciliation of loan information with certain servicers. It may be possible that our reports continue to reflect, as active, policies on mortgage loans that have been repaid. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies or a failure by servicers to appropriately report the status of a loan, this could impact the amount of assets Radian Guaranty is required to hold under the PMIERs or ultimately contribute to a rise in claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Under the terms of our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy, mortgage insurance premiums are not required to be paid following an event of default. However, if a defaulted loan then cures, all mortgage insurance premiums must be brought current for our insurance coverage to continue, including all premiums that were not paid during the period following the event of default and through the date of cure. Because premiums must be brought current upon a cure, mortgage servicers typically continue to pay mortgage insurance premiums while loans remain in default, understanding that Radian Guaranty will refund these premiums if the loans fail to cure and ultimately go to claim. If we fail to receive mortgage insurance premiums following mortgage defaults, Radian Guaranty s cash flow could be materially reduced, potentially requiring Radian Guaranty to liquidate investments at a loss to pay future claims or otherwise requiring us to alter our investment strategy. 
 We face risks associated with our contract underwriting business. 
 We provide third-party contract underwriting services for our mortgage insurance customers. Generally, we offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation defenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services. 
 A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our homegenius businesses. 
 The amount of new mortgage insurance business we write and real estate transactions we support through our homegenius title, real estate and technology products and services depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low

down payment mortgages that require private mortgage insurance and on the volume of real estate transactions that benefit from our services or products. The volume of mortgage originations is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, most of which are beyond our control, including housing prices, inflationary pressures, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other national and regional economic conditions. In Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, see Overview Current Operating Environment and Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage. Factors affecting the volume of low down payment mortgages include: 
 restrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, capital requirements affecting lenders, regulatory requirements and the health of the private securitization market; 
 mortgage interest rates; 
 the health of the domestic economy generally, including in particular unemployment levels and the degree of consumer confidence, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies; 
 housing supply and affordability; 
 tax laws and policies and their impact on, among other things, deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes; 
 demographic trends, including the rate of household formation; 
 the rate of home price appreciation; 
 government housing policy encouraging affordability and accessibility of mortgage loans, in particular to first-time homebuyers; and 
 the practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect the cost of mortgages and lenders willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages. 
 As the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we are subject to increased competition and we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and provide our homegenius products and services, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We are exposed to risks associated with our homegenius businesses that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our homegenius businesses expose us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following: 
 Our homegenius businesses are heavily focused on digital products and services, including software as a service solutions and proprietary technology platforms that depend on our ability to develop, launch and implement new and innovative technologies and digital solutions. As a result, this business is particularly exposed to challenges associated with new and rapidly evolving technologies and business environments, customer acceptance of our digital product and service offerings, the costs associated with the development and launch of these technologies and products, our failure to successfully integrate new technologies into our existing systems and the risk that our digital product and services offerings fail to operate as expected or planned or that expose us to additional cybersecurity or third-party risks; 
 Our homegenius businesses depend on our relationships with our customers. Our homegenius revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our homegenius total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect the level of our homegenius revenues. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted; 
 Due to the transactional nature of our business, our homegenius segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict; 
 The services we offer through our homegenius businesses are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally. If real estate transaction volumes decline, we could experience less demand for our real estate and title services; 
 homegenius Real Estate is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, homegenius Real Estate receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services. homegenius Real Estate receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services that comprise many of our homegenius product offerings, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or homegenius Real Estate otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact homegenius Real Estate s ability to conduct its business and our future real estate strategies. In addition to MLS data, we 
 55

 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

depend on access to data from a variety of other external sources to maintain our databases and grow our businesses. If we were to lose access to one or more of these data sources, the quality, pricing and availability of our homegenius products and services may be negatively impacted; 
 By their nature, title claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are administered and paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we could experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. These loss events are unpredictable and may require us to increase our title loss reserves and could adversely affect the financial performance of our homegenius segment; and 
 Our homegenius businesses operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer, and many have substantial resources. We expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors, technologies and products that are designed to disrupt traditional business models. There can be no assurance that our homegenius businesses will be able to compete successfully. 
 Any of these factors could negatively affect our homegenius businesses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely upon proprietary technology and information, and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, it could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distributing and creating derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face risks associated with our new mortgage conduit business. 
 In July 2022 we launched our mortgage conduit business in Radian Mortgage Capital. Subject to market conditions, Radian Mortgage Capital acquires residential mortgage loans, including by utilizing short-term uncommitted debt under the Master Repurchase Agreements, which loans Radian Mortgage Capital then expects to distribute into the capital markets through private label securitizations or by selling them directly to mortgage investors, with the option to retain and manage structured components of the underlying credit risk. As a result of our entry into this business, we are exposed to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following: 
 Potential breaches of the financial and other covenants under our Master Repurchase Agreements could result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs, as well as potentially triggering cross-defaults under other debt agreements. 
 Interest rate fluctuations can negatively impact our mortgage conduit business. 
 Changes in interest rates and other factors could cause the cost of financing a mortgage asset to exceed the income generated by that mortgage asset. An increase in interest rates generally increases the overall cost to finance our acquisitions of mortgage loans and reduces the fair value of mortgage loans pledged as collateral for our payment obligations. 
 We have an interest rate risk hedging program and seek to hedge interest rate risks associated with our acquisition of mortgage assets; however, changes in interest rates, securities spreads and other factors could cause net losses on the mortgage assets and our hedge position. There can be no assurance that our hedging activity will be effective, or that future market conditions or our financial condition in the future will enable us to maintain an effective interest rate risk hedging program. 
 Under our Master Repurchase Agreements we pledge mortgage assets as security for our payment obligations and the agreements contain margin requirements which require us to pledge additional collateral if the value of previously pledged collateral declines below certain levels. Therefore, if the value of the collateral decreases below certain levels, we could be required to satisfy a margin call under the Master Repurchase Agreements. In addition, certain of our hedges are also subject to margin calls. As this business grows, any of these margin calls could have a material adverse effect on Radian Mortgage Capital s liquidity position and could require Radian Group to satisfy the margin requirements through capital contributions to Radian Mortgage Capital, which could impact Radian Group s available liquidity. See Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations . 
 56

 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

If the secondary markets for mortgages or for residential mortgage-backed securities experiences any significant disruption or illiquidity, we might be unable to sell our mortgage assets in a timely manner or at favorable prices and we may be forced to hold and finance a larger inventory of mortgage assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
 Because we do not originate residential loans, the growth of our mortgage conduit business may be limited if mortgage loans are not available for purchase at attractive prices. Mortgage loan originations may fluctuate from period to period, and a reduced volume of loan originations that satisfy our acquisition guidelines may make it difficult for us to acquire loans. 
 When we purchase mortgage loans, representations and warranties are made to us by sellers regarding, among other things, certain characteristics of those mortgage loans, which we seek to verify through underwriting and due diligence. When we sell mortgage loans, we make similar representations and warranties to purchasers. Losses could result if representations or warranties we make to purchasers are inaccurate, including representations or warranties made in reliance on inaccurate representations or warranties that are made to us. 
 The business of Radian Mortgage Capital subjects us to additional legal and regulatory requirements that we may fail to satisfy. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or to have appropriate authorizations, exemptions or state licenses could limit our ability to conduct our business in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines, injunctions or other relief, which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the nature and extent of applicable laws and regulations could materially change, which may result in additional costs or changes to our operations associated with compliance. 
 We rely on third-party service providers to service the mortgage loans for which we hold the right to service and serve as the master servicer. Our reliance on third-party servicers exposes us to certain risks, including the risk that the subservicer may not properly service the loan in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or the contractual provisions governing their subservicing role, in which case we may be held liable for the subservicer s improper acts or omissions. Failure to take steps to ensure that third-party servicers are servicing the loans we acquire appropriately could expose us to penalties or other claims or enforcement actions that could negatively impact our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, an investment company is required to register with the SEC and is subject to extensive restrictive regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. We intend to conduct our businesses and operations so Radian Mortgage Capital is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Failure to continue to qualify for exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 could result in significant restrictions on our business activities, prohibitions from engaging in certain business activities and subject us to burdensome compliance requirements and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to the Economic Environment 
 The credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages. 
 Mortgage defaults occur due to a variety of specific events affecting individual borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family-related factors and unemployment, among other events. While mortgage defaults can and do occur in any economic environment, there is a high correlation between the overall health of the economy and the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. As a result, our results are particularly influenced by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including events that impact mortgage originations and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, most of which are beyond our control, including housing prices, inflationary pressures, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other national and regional economic conditions. These conditions may be created or exacerbated by: acts of terrorism, war or other geopolitical conditions and conflicts; event-specific economic depressions; U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns; severe weather events and natural disasters, which may continue to increase in severity and frequency due to climate change; and other catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other future epidemics or pandemics. In general, challenging economic conditions increase the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to satisfy their mortgage obligations. 
 In addition, a deteriorating economy also can adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so. A decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, increasing the likelihood that a default will result in a claim. Declining housing values also may impact the effectiveness of our loss mitigation actions. The amount of the loss we could suffer depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover the unpaid principal balance, interest and the expenses of the sale. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Currently, the U.S. economy is experiencing a high rate of inflation, slower economic growth and the risk of a recession. Future volatility may occur due to, among other things, declining home prices, the risk of higher unemployment rates and political conditions, including debate over raising the U.S. debt limit, among other factors. The unfavorable macroeconomic developments and other factors cited above may again have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio. 
 Our investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists primarily of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions and tax policies, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities and the level of our net investment income, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. 
 Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we invest has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, including as a result of the disruption in the financial markets following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently, inflationary and interest rate trends. The value of our investment portfolio is subject to market risk and may be adversely affected by other factors outside of our control, such as ratings downgrades, bankruptcies and credit spreads widening, any of which may cause unrealized or realized losses. When the credit environment deteriorates, the risk of impairments of our investments increases. Disruption and volatility in the financial markets, including sharp increases in market interest rates as we have recently experienced, could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. See Our reported earnings, stockholders equity and book value per share are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our investments that require us to adjust their fair market value . 
 Currently, federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over legislation to raise the U.S. government s debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, related credit-rating downgrades, or an economic recession in the United States. Many of our investment securities are issued by the U.S. government and government agencies and sponsored entities. As a result of uncertain domestic political conditions, including potential future federal government shutdowns, the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a short period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues, investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks. Any potential downgrades by rating agencies in long-term sovereign credit ratings, as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries, could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions worldwide. 
 For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive favorable treatment under insurance regulatory requirements and full credit as Available Assets under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in investment grade fixed income investments with yields that reflect their lower credit risk profile. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the Model Act or PMIERs, including potentially to better align with the ERCF and the proposed liquidity requirements for the GSEs, could restrict our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy. 
 In addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our future claim payments or other liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Climate change and extreme weather events could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our businesses, results of operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted by climate change and extreme weather events, especially if these occurrences negatively impact the overall real estate market and the broader economy. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and forest fires and drive other ecologically related changes such as rising sea waters, which in turn could negatively affect regional economies in ways that impact home values or unemployment, and therefore, the credit performance of the mortgages we insure in affected areas. In addition, the inability of a borrower to obtain hazard and/or flood insurance, or the increased cost of such insurance, could lead to an increase in delinquencies or a decrease in home prices in the affected areas. If we were to attempt to limit our new insurance written in affected areas, lenders may choose not to do business with us anywhere. Natural disasters could also lead to increased reinsurance rates or reduced availability of reinsurance. This may cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain and could negatively affect our compliance with financial requirements. In January 2021, the FHFA issued a Request for Input regarding Climate and Natural Disaster Risk Management at the GSEs and the Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHFA has instructed the GSEs to designate climate change as a priority concern and actively consider its effects in their decision making. It is possible that efforts to manage this risk by the FHFA, GSEs (including through GSE guideline or mortgage insurance policy changes) or others could materially impact the volume and characteristics of our NIW (including the terms of our master policy), home prices in certain areas and 
 58

defaults by borrowers in certain areas. Further, climate change and natural disasters may impact the value of and cause volatility in our investment portfolio, and we might not achieve our investment objectives. Climate change and the frequency, severity, duration, and geography of severe weather events and other ecological-related changes are inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact these events may have on our business and financial condition. 
 Our reported earnings, stockholders equity and book value per share are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our investments that require us to adjust their fair market value. 
 We have significant holdings of trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. In addition, we increase or decrease our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost) of our available for sale securities portfolio, net of related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As a result, a decline in the fair value of our available for sale portfolio may result in a decline in reported stockholders equity, as well as book value per common share. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders equity. These negative impacts will occur even though the securities are not sold. Also, in the event there are credit loss related impairments, the credit loss component and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recognized in earnings. 
 The discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect us. 
 In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit rate quotations required to calculate LIBOR. The FCA no longer publishes one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates and plans to cease publishing all other LIBOR tenors (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month) on June 30, 2023. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a committee consisting of representatives of large U.S. financial institutions, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. SOFR is the rate charged on overnight repurchase obligations collateralized by Treasury securities, and is compiled by the New York Federal Reserve Bank. There remains uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in financial instruments that are currently indexed to LIBOR. Further, various financial instruments indexed to LIBOR could experience different outcomes based on their contractual terms, ability to amend those terms, market or product type, legal or regulatory jurisdiction, and other factors. SOFR, or any other alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR, may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of the financial instruments, which could adversely affect the value of and return on these instruments. 
 Although our insurance-linked notes transactions and our credit facility provide for a transition from LIBOR upon the occurrence of specified events, the discontinuation of LIBOR may have an adverse effect on the premium rates we are required to pay in connection with certain of our excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements associated with our existing insurance-linked notes transactions as well as the cost of borrowings under our credit facility, which are tied to LIBOR. Further, the discontinuation of LIBOR may negatively impact the value of other assets or liabilities with values tied to LIBOR or to a LIBOR alternative, including floating rate bonds that we hold in our investment portfolio. Furthermore, in addition to potential impacts on our investment portfolio and our cost of debt, the discontinuation of LIBOR may impact other aspects of our business, such as our insurance products, the pricing we charge and the models we use to support our business decisions. It is possible that the discontinuance of LIBOR, including the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Liquidity and Financing 
 Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations. 
 Radian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Analysis Holding Company for more information on our available liquidity and short-term and long-term liquidity demands. 
 As discussed above under Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity , compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity if additional capital support for Radian Guaranty is required for it to maintain this compliance. The amount of capital that Radian Group could be required to contribute to Radian Guaranty for this purpose is uncertain, but could be significant. 
 In addition, Radian Mortgage Capital has entered into the Master Repurchase Agreements to finance its acquisition of residential mortgage loans, and Radian Group has guaranteed the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries under these loan repurchase facilities. As discussed above under We face risks associated with our new mortgage conduit business , a decline in the value of collateral pledged under these agreements and our hedging agreements could trigger a margin call and 
 59 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors 

require Radian Mortgage Capital to pledge additional collateral under these arrangements, which Radian Mortgage Capital may be unable to satisfy without a capital contribution from Radian Group. Any capital contribution could be significant in amount as this business grows. 
 In addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group s most significant near-term sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements; (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities; and (iii) to the extent available, dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Radian Guaranty s ability to pay dividends. 
 Radian Group s expense-sharing arrangements with its principal operating subsidiaries require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group s outstanding senior notes. The expense- sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time. 
 In light of Radian Group s short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund its obligations. If this were to occur, we may choose not to pursue certain actions, such as issuing dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock, or we may elect to reduce the levels of these activities to preserve our available liquidity. In addition, we may seek to increase our available liquidity, including by seeking additional capital, incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Our revolving credit facility and the Parent Guarantees we provide for the Master Repurchase Agreements to finance loan purchases in our mortgage conduit business contain restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility or these Parent Guarantees could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it. 
 Radian Group is a party to a 275 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. 
 The credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions. Our ability to borrow under the credit facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including covenants related to minimum net worth and statutory capital, a maximum debt-to-capitalization level, repayment or refinancing of a portion of our senior debt maturities prior to their maturity, and limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets and merge with or acquire other companies. The credit facility also requires that Radian Guaranty remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could: (i) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (ii) enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable. 
 Further, the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our credit facility may trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. An event of default would occur under the terms of our senior notes if a default: (i) in any scheduled payment of principal of other indebtedness by Radian Group or its subsidiaries of more than 100 million principal amount occurs, after giving effect to any applicable grace period or (ii) in the performance of any term or provision of any indebtedness of Radian Group or its subsidiaries in excess of 100 million principal amount occurs that results in the acceleration of the date such indebtedness is due and payable, subject to certain limited exceptions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the carrying value of our senior notes. 
 In connection with our new mortgage conduit, Radian Group has entered into the Parent Guarantees that guarantee the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreements. Under these Parent Guarantees, Radian Group is subject to negative and affirmative covenants customary for this type of financing transaction, including compliance with financial covenants that are generally consistent with the comparable covenants in the Company s revolving credit facility, as discussed above. 
 If we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations or experience an event of default under the credit facility or the Parent Guarantees, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices and operations, or pursue our current strategy, could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility, the guarantees or our senior notes is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.

Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
 Our information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers demands. 
 Our business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattacks and security incidents or breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion. 
 Additionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or to otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. We rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide our products and services to our customers, and they generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with business partners with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing relationships with mortgage insurance or mortgage and real estate services providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers. We are also dependent on our ongoing relationships with key technology providers, including their products and technologies, and their ability to support those products and technologies. The inability of these providers to successfully provide and support those products could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 Because we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We could incur significant liability or reputational harm if the security of our information technology systems, or of our third-party vendors or service providers, is breached, including as result of a cyberattack, or we otherwise fail to protect confidential information, including personally identifiable information that we maintain. 
 We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between us and our employees, customers, business partners and service providers depends on information technology and electronic information exchange. 
 Our reliance on information technology has been further accelerated by our transition to a hybrid work environment, which has increased our exposure to the risk of cybersecurity threats and data security incidents. 
 Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions. We experience cyber activity directed at our computer systems, software, networks and network users on a daily basis. This malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access, implantation of computer viruses or malware and denial-of-service attacks. In addition, on a global scale, other forms of social engineering and insider threats designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or to cause other damage have also grown in volume and level of sophistication. Such attacks may also increase in response to actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in connection with Russia s military invasion of Ukraine. Security incidents have from time to time occurred and may occur in the future. Although to date security incidents have not had a material impact on us, the risks of cyberattacks and information security incidents and breaches continue to increase in businesses such as ours due to, among other things, the proliferation of new technologies and the use of digital channels to conduct our business, including connectivity with customer devices that are beyond our security control systems and the use of portable computers or mobile devices which can be stolen, lost or damaged. We expect attacks to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that could hinder our ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. 
 We also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct important aspects of our business operations, and we face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach. We also cannot be certain that we will receive timely notification of such cyberattacks or other security breaches. In addition, in order to access our products and services, our clients may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems. 
 As part of our business, we, and certain subsidiaries, affiliates, and third-party vendors maintain large amounts of confidential information, including personally identifiable information on borrowers, consumers and our employees. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If the security of our information technology or the technology of our third-party vendors is breached, including as a result of a cyberattack, it could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory

actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, there can be no assurance that such unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur. Any cybersecurity event or other compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract and maintain customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally 
 We may not continue to pay dividends at the same rate we are currently paying them, or at all, and any decrease in or suspension of payment of a dividend could cause our stock price to decline. 
 The payment of future cash dividends is subject to the determination each quarter by our board of directors that the dividend remains in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including, among others, economic conditions, our earnings, financial condition, actual and forecasted cash flows, capital resources, capital requirements and alternative uses of capital, including potential investments to support our business strategy and possible acquisitions or investments in new businesses. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline. 
 We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
 We operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. From time to time we are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of existing and future legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements. 
 Our success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Competition for personnel is intense and has further increased in light of evolving labor and employment trends, including but not limited to the increase in remote, hybrid or other alternative flexible work arrangements. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting increase in work from home arrangements within many industries, including ours, there is a higher likelihood that highly skilled individuals may seek to change employers in pursuit of greater opportunities or greater benefits. In the current labor and employment environment, it may be more difficult to retain key personnel or to attract new resources who now may have greater optionality among potential employers given the ability to work from home. 
 The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including costs associated with a loss of productivity and costs to replace employees, may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings. 
 Investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business subject us to additional risks and uncertainties. 
 In support of our growth and diversification strategy, we may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business. We may do this through strategic transactions, including investments and acquisitions, or pursue other transformative actions and initiatives. These activities expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation: 
 the use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses; 
 the assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic transaction, including any acquired business; 
 our ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business or other business or strategic initiatives;

our ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition; 
 new or existing business initiatives may be disruptive to, or competitive with, our existing customers; 
 we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a strategic transaction or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all; 
 new business initiatives may expose us to liquidity risk, risks associated with the use of financial leverage, and market risks, including risk resulting from changes in the fair values of assets in which we invest. Further, new business initiatives may increase our exposure to interest rate risk and may involve changes in our investment, financing and hedging strategies; 
 we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic transaction or initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired; and 
 the risk of reputational harm if the strategic transaction or initiative fails to increase our market value. 
 
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted us and, in the future, our business, results of operations or financial condition could again be impacted by COVID-19 or other epidemics, pandemics or public health developments. 
 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 created periods of significant economic uncertainty, high unemployment, and volatility and disruption in financial markets and in the U.S. housing finance system and real estate markets. These impacts, together with the implementation of governmental and GSE programs designed to assist borrowers experiencing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted our results of operations and financial condition in the periods immediately following the onset of the pandemic by driving an increase in new mortgage defaults (primarily related to borrowers deciding to take advantage of mortgage forbearance programs that allowed them to suspend mortgage payments), requiring an increase in our mortgage insurance loss reserves and resulting in an increase in the length of time that mortgage defaults, if not cured, have remained in our defaulted loan inventory; disrupting our access to the reinsurance and capital markets; and impacting the performance of our investment portfolio. 
 The magnitude or duration of any further business and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics, pandemics and public health developments and their long-term effect on our businesses will depend on a number of factors and future developments which are highly uncertain, including: the extent, evolution and duration of any reemergence of the COVID-19 virus or any new epidemics, pandemics or other public health developments; the availability of anti-viral treatments and vaccines; the wider economic effects of any epidemics, pandemics, or other public health developments, including the scope and duration of governmental and other third-party measures restricting day-to-day life and business operations; the impact of economic stimulus efforts to support the economy; and governmental and GSE programs implemented to assist borrowers experiencing hardship as a result of any pandemics, epidemics or other public health developments. Due to the significant uncertainty regarding the future impact of COVID-19 or any other epidemics, pandemics or public health developments, it is not possible to predict their overall impact on our business, business prospects, operating results and financial condition, which could be significant.

Overview 
 We are a diversified mortgage and real estate business with two reportable business segments Mortgage and homegenius. 
 Our Mortgage segment aggregates, manages and distributes U.S. mortgage credit risk for the benefit of mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, and also provides contract underwriting and other credit risk management solutions to our customers. Our homegenius segment offers an array of title, real estate and technology products and services to consumers, mortgage lenders, mortgage and real estate investors, GSEs, real estate brokers and agents. 
 See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments. See Key Factors Affecting Our Results below for information about current business conditions and other factors that affect the performance of our Mortgage and homegenius businesses. 
 Current Operating Environment 
 As a seller of mortgage credit protection and other mortgage and credit risk management solutions and real estate products and services, our business results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing, housing finance and related real estate markets, the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio and our future business opportunities, as well as seasonal fluctuations that specifically affect the mortgage origination and real estate environments. The performance of our Mortgage business is particularly influenced by housing prices, inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, unemployment levels, mortgage originations and the availability of credit, national and regional economic conditions and other events that impact housing and real estate markets and the ability of borrowers to remain current on their mortgages, most of which are beyond our control. 
 The U.S. economy is currently experiencing a high rate of inflation, with annual inflation reaching a 40-year high in 2022, as well as slower economic growth, declining home prices and the risks of a recession and of higher unemployment rates.

 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Recent actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in response to the inflationary trends that started in 2021 resulted in a sharp and significant increase in mortgage interest rates during 2022, with mortgage rates more than doubling to nearly 7 at the end of 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates further in the first quarter of 2023 and has signaled that it expects to continue to increase rates in future periods. These economic conditions have negatively impacted the U.S. housing market, broadly reducing refinance activity and new purchase transactions and resulting in decreasing home prices in recent months in many markets. As further discussed below, we expect that the current economic environment will continue to negatively impact certain aspects of our results, including lower NIW, lower homegenius revenues, higher mortgage insurance defaults and lower investment fair values. At the same time, we also expect to benefit from the higher interest rate environment through higher Persistency Rates that will favorably impact our IIF, as well as through the recognition of higher net investment income, as further discussed below. 
 In light of the current economic and operating environments, throughout 2022 we have taken steps to align our workforce to the current and expected needs of the business. As such, as of February 22, 2023, we had approximately 30 fewer employees than we had at year end 2021. See Results of Operations Consolidated Expenses Other Operating Expenses for additional information. 
 The cooling effect of current economic conditions on U.S. housing markets throughout 2022 has resulted in a smaller insurable market compared to 2021, reducing our NIW. We wrote NIW of 68.0 billion in 2022, a decrease of 26 compared to our NIW in 2021. We expect these conditions to continue to negatively impact our NIW volumes in future periods. Longer-term, however, we continue to believe that the housing market fundamentals and outlook remain favorable, including demographics supporting growth in the population of first-time homebuyers and a constrained supply of homes available for sale. While the recent increases in mortgage interest rates have significantly reduced refinance demand, they have also resulted in a decrease in policy cancellations, which has increased our Persistency Rate, and in turn contributed to growth in our IIF. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio below for additional details on our NIW and IIF. 
 The same inflationary pressures and higher interest rate environment that are impacting mortgage refinance demand and our NIW are also impacting our homegenius businesses, including a significant decrease in our title revenues beginning in the second quarter of 2022, due to the rapid decline in industry-wide refinance volumes. The current macroeconomic trends, and the corresponding softening in demand for home sales and mortgage refinancings, have also impacted the market demand for our new proprietary real estate technology products and services, which in some cases have been delayed by longer than anticipated launch timelines. 
 The recent sharp increases in interest rates also materially affected the fair value of our investment portfolio in 2022, resulting in significant unrealized losses on investments. Given our intent and ability as of December 31, 2022, to hold these securities until recovery of their amortized cost basis, we do not expect to realize a loss on any of our investments in an unrealized loss position. The decrease in the fair value of our investments due to higher market interest rates negatively affected our net income and stockholders equity during 2022. Conversely, this higher interest rate environment resulted in the recognition of higher net investment income in 2022, which is expected to continue in future periods. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our investments. 
 The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in unemployment, which had a negative impact on the economy. As a result, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in 2020, substantially all of which related to defaults of loans subject to mortgage forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the increase in the number of new mortgage defaults resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on our results of operations and our reserve for losses for that year. However, subsequent trends in Cures have been more favorable than original expectations, resulting in favorable loss reserve development on prior period defaults in 2021 and in 2022. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reserve for losses. 
 As noted above, at the start of the pandemic, we experienced a material increase in new defaults and our primary default rate increased sharply to 6.5 at June 30, 2020. Since then, favorable trends in the number of new defaults and Cures have led to a decline in our default inventory and default rate, resulting in a primary default rate of 2.2 at December 31, 2022. However, deteriorating economic conditions, including declining home prices and the risks of a recession and of higher unemployment rates, have increased the likelihood that we will experience higher levels of new default activity and lower levels of Cures in our mortgage insurance portfolio. The number, timing and duration of new defaults and, in turn, the number of defaults that ultimately result in claims will depend on a variety of factors, including the overall economic environment and on the number and timing of Cures and the net impact on IIF from our Persistency Rate and future NIW. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties. 
 Despite risks and uncertainties, we believe that the steps we have taken in recent years, including by improving our capital and liquidity positions, enhancing our financial flexibility, implementing greater risk-based granularity into our pricing methodologies and increasing our use of risk distribution strategies to lower the risk profile and financial volatility of our mortgage insurance portfolio, have helped position the Company to better withstand the negative effects from the macroeconomic stresses discussed above, including those resulting from the high rate of inflation and higher interest rates, as well as the other risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

In particular, we believe that the range of risk distribution transactions and strategies that we utilize have increased our financial strength and flexibility by mitigating credit risk and financial volatility through varying economic cycles. As of December 31, 2022, 70 of our primary RIF is subject to a form of risk distribution and our estimated reinsurance recoverable related to our mortgage insurance portfolio was 25 million. Our use of risk distribution structures has reduced our required capital and enhanced our projected return on capital, and we expect these structures to provide a level of credit protection in periods of economic stress. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Risk Distribution for additional information. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
 The following sections discuss certain key drivers affecting our Mortgage and homegenius businesses, as well as other key factors affecting our results. 
 Mortgage 
 IIF and Related Drivers 
 Our IIF is one of the primary drivers of our future premiums that we expect to earn over time. Although not reflected in the current period financial statements, nor in our reported book value, we expect our IIF to generate substantial earnings in future periods due to the high credit quality of our current mortgage insurance portfolio and our expectations for future Persistency Rates. 
 The ultimate profitability of our mortgage insurance business is affected by the impact of mortgage prepayment speeds on the mix of business we write. The measure for assessing the impact of policy cancellations on our IIF is our Persistency Rate, defined as the percentage of IIF that remains in force over a period of time. Assuming all other factors remain constant, over the life of the policies, prepayment speeds have an inverse impact on IIF and the expected revenue from our Monthly Premium Policies. Slower loan prepayment speeds, demonstrated by a higher Persistency Rate, result in more IIF remaining in place, providing increased revenue from Monthly Premium Policies over time as premium payments continue. Earlier than anticipated loan prepayments, demonstrated by a lower Persistency Rate, reduce IIF and the revenue from our Monthly Premium Policies. Among other factors, prepayment speeds may be affected by changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. A rising interest rate environment generally will reduce refinancing activity and result in lower prepayments, whereas a declining interest rate environment generally will increase the level of refinancing activity and therefore increase prepayments. 
 In contrast to Monthly Premium Policies, when Single Premium Policies are cancelled by the insured because the loan has been paid off or otherwise, we accelerate the recognition of any remaining unearned premiums, net of any refunds that may be owed to the borrower. Although these cancellations reduce IIF, assuming all other factors remain constant, the profitability of our Single Premium business increases when Persistency Rates are lower. As a result, we believe that writing a mix of Single Premium Policies and Monthly Premium Policies has the potential to moderate the overall impact on our results if actual prepayment speeds are significantly different from expectations. However, the impact of this moderating effect may be affected by the amount of reinsurance we obtain on portions of our portfolio, with the Single Premium QSR Program currently reducing the proportion of retained Single Premium Policies in our portfolio. 
 Based on the current composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio, with Monthly Premium Policies comprising a larger proportion of our total portfolio than Single Premium Policies, an increase or decrease in IIF generally has a corresponding positive (increase in IIF) or negative (decrease in IIF) impact on premiums earned. Cancellations of our insurance policies as a result of prepayments and other reductions of IIF, such as Rescissions of coverage and claims paid, generally have a negative effect on premiums earned over time. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Insurance and Risk in Force for more information about the levels and characteristics of our IIF. 
 NIW and Related Drivers 
 NIW increases our IIF and our premiums written and earned. NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market, the penetration percentage of private mortgage insurance into the overall mortgage origination market and our market share of the private mortgage insurance market. The overall mortgage origination market is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as household formation, household composition, home affordability, interest rates, housing markets in general, which are subject to seasonality, credit availability and the impact of various legislative and regulatory actions that may influence the housing and mortgage finance industries. The penetration percentage of private mortgage insurance is mainly influenced by: (i) the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance for GSE conforming loans compared to FHA and VA insured loans and (ii) the relative percentage of mortgage originations that are for purchased homes versus refinances. We believe, for example, that given current pricing levels, which are subject to change, the generally better execution available through the GSEs for borrowers with higher FICO scores, lender preferences and the inability to cancel FHA insurance for certain loans are factors that currently provide a competitive advantage for private mortgage insurers. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio New Insurance Written.

Private mortgage insurance penetration in the insurable market has generally been higher on new mortgages for purchased homes than on the refinance of existing mortgages, because average LTVs are typically higher on home purchases, and therefore, these lower down payment loans are more likely to require mortgage insurance. Radian Guaranty s share of the private mortgage insurance market is influenced by competition in that market. See Item 1. Business Competition.

Premiums 
 The premium rates we charge for our insurance are based on a number of borrower, loan and property characteristics. The mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and private mortgage insurers compete with each other and with the FHA and VA with respect to price and other factors. 
 Our pricing is risk-based and is intended to generally align with the capital requirements under the PMIERs, while also considering pricing trends within the private mortgage insurance industry among other factors. As a result, our pricing is expected to generate relatively consistent returns across the credit spectrum. In developing our pricing strategies, we monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to maximize the long-term economic value of our portfolio by balancing credit risk, lender and geographic concentration risk, profitability and volume considerations, and aim to achieve an overall risk-adjusted rate of return on capital given our modeled performance expectations. Our actual portfolio returns will depend on a number of factors, including economic conditions, the mix of NIW that we are able to write, our pricing, the amount of reinsurance we use and the level of capital required under the PMIERs financial requirements. 
 Our pricing actions gradually affect our results over time, as existing IIF cancels and is replaced with NIW at current pricing. See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio New Insurance Written and Liquidity and Capital Resources Mortgage below for additional information. 
 As described above, premiums on our mortgage insurance products are generally paid either on an installment basis, pursuant to Monthly Premium Policies, or in a single payment at the time of loan origination, pursuant to Single Premium Policies. See Item 1. Business Mortgage Pricing Primary Mortgage Insurance Premiums. Our expected premium yield on our Single Premium Policies is lower than on our Monthly Premium Policies because our premium rates for the life of the policy are generally lower for our Single Premium Policies. However, as discussed above, the ultimate profitability of Single Premium Policies may be higher or lower than expected due to the impact of prepayment speeds. See IIF and Related Drivers above. 
 Approximately 82 of the loans in our total Primary Mortgage Insurance portfolio at December 31, 2022, are Monthly Premium Policies that provide a level monthly premium for the first 10 years of the policy, followed by a lower level monthly premium thereafter. For loans that have been refinanced under HARP, the initial 10-year period is reset. Generally, a borrower is able to cancel the policy when the LTV reaches 80 of the original value, and the servicer is required to review the policy for automatic cancellation on the date the LTV is scheduled to reach 78 of the original value. As a result, the volume of loans that remain insured after 10 years and would be subject to the premium reset is generally not material in relation to the total loans originated. However, to the extent the volume of loans resetting from year to year varies significantly, the trend in earned premiums may also vary. 
 Losses 
 Incurred losses represent the estimated future claim payments on newly defaulted insured loans as well as any change in our claim estimates for existing defaults, including changes in our estimates with respect to the frequency, magnitude and timing of anticipated losses on defaulted loans. Other factors influencing incurred losses include: 
 The mix of credit characteristics in our total direct RIF (e.g., loans with higher risk characteristics, or loans with layered risk that combine multiple higher-risk attributes within the same loan, generally result in more delinquencies and claims). See Mortgage Insurance Portfolio Insurance and Risk in Force; 
 The average loan size (relatively higher priced properties with larger average loan amounts may result in higher incurred losses); 
 The percentage of coverage on insured loans (higher percentages of insurance coverage generally correlate with higher incurred losses) and the presence of structural mitigants such as deductibles or stop losses; 
 Changes in housing values (declines in housing values generally make it more difficult for borrowers to sell a home to avoid default or for the property to be sold to mitigate a claim, and also may negatively affect a borrower s willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the home value is less than the mortgage balance; conversely, increases in housing values tend to reduce the level of defaults as well as make it more likely that foreclosures will result in the loan being satisfied); 
 The distribution of claims over the life cycle of a portfolio (historically, claims are relatively low during the first two years after a loan is originated and then increase over a period of several years before declining; however, several factors can impact and change this cycle, including the economic environment, the quality of the underwriting of the loan, characteristics of the mortgage loan, the credit profile of the borrower, housing prices and unemployment rates); and 
 Our ability to mitigate potential losses through Rescissions, Claim Denials, cancellations and Claim Curtailments on claims submitted to us. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see Our Loss Mitigation Activity could negatively impact our customer relationships.

Risk Distribution 
 We use third-party reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business to manage capital and risk in an effort to optimize the amounts and types of capital and risk distribution deployed against insured risk. See IIF and Related Drivers above. Currently, we distribute risk in our mortgage insurance portfolio through quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance programs. 
 When we enter into a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, agrees to insure an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. These arrangements reduce our earned premiums but also reduce our net RIF, which provides capital relief, including under the PMIERs financial requirements. Our incurred losses are reduced by any incurred losses ceded in accordance with the reinsurance agreement, and we often receive ceding commissions from the reinsurer as part of the transaction, which, in turn, reduce our reported operating expenses and policy acquisition costs. 
 Our Excess-of-Loss Program primarily accesses the capital markets through the Eagle Re Issuers issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes. Our Excess-of-Loss Program reduces our earned premiums, but also reduces our net RIF and PMIERs financial requirements, and potentially our incurred losses, which are allocated in accordance with the structure of the transaction. The Eagle Re Issuers are special purpose VIEs that are not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements because we do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to their economic performance. 
 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our reinsurance arrangements, including the total assets and liabilities of the Eagle Re Issuers. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income is determined primarily by the investment balances held and the average yield on our overall investment portfolio. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Our other operating expenses include salaries and other base employee costs, variable and share-based incentive compensation and other general operating expenses, such as fees for professional and consulting services, software, rent and depreciation, among other costs. Employee related expenses are driven by our headcount, which can fluctuate due to the amount of our NIW and IIF, as well as our plans for other business initiatives. Our other operating expenses may also fluctuate due to the impact of performance on our incentive compensation programs, as a result of our pay-for-performance approach to compensation that is based on the level of achievement of both short-term and long-term goals. 
 These operating expenses are reported net of ceding commissions associated with our QSR Program. As a result, changes to our QSR Program and the amount of our ceded premiums earned also can impact our other operating expenses. 
 homegenius 
 Premiums 
 We earn net premiums on title insurance through Radian Title Insurance. Demand for title insurance may be impacted by general marketplace competition in the real estate title industry, coupled with housing market related conditions such as new home sales, the sizes of the real estate purchase and refinance markets and interest rate fluctuations. 
 Services Revenue 
 Our homegenius segment is dependent upon overall activity in the mortgage finance and real estate markets, as well as market receptivity to the products we offer. Due, in part, to the transactional nature of the business, revenues for our homegenius segment are subject to fluctuations from period to period, including seasonal fluctuations that reflect the activities in these markets. Sales volume is also affected by the number of competing companies and alternative products offered in the market. We believe the diversity of services we offer has the potential to produce fee income from the homegenius segment throughout various mortgage finance environments and economic cycles, although market conditions can significantly impact the mix and amount of fee income we generate in any particular period. See Item 1. Business homegenius Overview for more information on our homegenius services. 
 The homegenius segment is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant portion of its revenues. Generally, our contracts do not contain volume commitments and may be terminated by clients at any time. While access to Radian Guaranty s mortgage insurance customer base provides additional opportunities to expand the homegenius segment s existing customers, an unexpected loss of a major customer could significantly impact the level of homegenius revenue. 
 Our homegenius revenue is primarily generated under fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified services and deliverables for a predetermined per-unit price. To the extent our actual direct and allocated indirect costs decrease or increase from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less

profit, respectively, or could incur a loss. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on revenue recognition policies for our homegenius segment. 
 Cost of Services 
 Our cost of services is primarily affected by our level of services revenue and the number of employees providing products and services for our homegenius businesses. Our cost of services primarily consists of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, and to a lesser extent, other costs of providing services such as travel and related expenses incurred in providing client services, costs paid to outside vendors, data acquisition costs and other compensation-related expenses to maintain software application platforms that directly support our businesses. The level of these costs may fluctuate as market rates of compensation change, or if there is decreased availability or a loss of qualified employees. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits not classified as cost of services because they are related to employees, such as sales and corporate employees, who are not directly involved in providing client services. Operating expenses also include other selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and allocations of corporate general and administrative expenses. 
 See Item 1. Business homegenius Overview and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the homegenius segment. 
 Net Gains (Losses) on Investments and Other Financial Instruments 
 In addition, net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments also may impact our consolidated results in the ordinary course. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods, as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile and overall market cycles. Unrealized gains and losses arise primarily from changes in the market value of our investments that are classified as trading or equity securities. These valuation adjustments may not necessarily result in realized economic gains or losses.

New Insurance Written 
 A key component of our current business strategy is to write NIW that we believe will generate future earnings and economic value while effectively maintaining the portfolio s health, balance and profitability. Consistent with this objective, we wrote 68.0 billion of primary new mortgage insurance in 2022, compared to 91.8 billion of NIW in 2021. 
 Our 2022 NIW, offset by policy cancellations and amortization within our existing portfolio, resulted in IIF of 261.0 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 246.0 billion at December 31, 2021, as shown in the chart above. Our NIW decreased by 26 in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to lower refinance originations and a reduction in the size of the overall insurable market, partially offset by an increase in our market share in 2022. 
 Among other factors, private mortgage insurance industry volumes are impacted by total mortgage origination volumes and the mix between mortgage originations that are for home purchases versus refinancings of existing mortgages. Historically, the penetration rate for private mortgage insurance generally has been three to five times higher for purchase transactions than for refinancings. However, with significant home price appreciation in recent years, penetration on purchase transactions has increased while penetration on refinancings has decreased, and the penetration rate for private mortgage insurance has shifted to 12 to 16 times higher for purchase transactions than for refinancings. 
 According to industry estimates, total mortgage origination volume was significantly lower in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to a significant decline in refinance activity and a smaller decline in home purchases. Although it is difficult to project future volumes, recent industry projections for 2023 estimate total mortgage originations of approximately 1.8 trillion, which would represent a decline in the total annual mortgage origination market of approximately 23 as compared to 2022. Factoring in our projections of private mortgage insurance penetration in the overall insurable mortgage market, we estimate that the private mortgage insurance market will be between 275 billion and 325 billion in 2023. This outlook anticipates a further decrease in refinance originations in 2023 resulting from increased interest rates. While expectations for refinance volume vary, there is an industry-wide consensus that we should expect a healthy purchase market in 2023 driven by ongoing homebuyer demand, which is a positive for mortgage insurers given the higher likelihood that purchase loans will utilize private mortgage insurance as compared to refinance loans. If refinance volume declines, we would expect the Persistency Rate for our portfolio to increase, benefiting the size of our IIF portfolio. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. 
 Our total mix of Single Premium Policies decreased to 5 of our NIW for 2022, compared to 7 for 2021. Borrower-paid Single Premium Policies were 96 of our total direct Single Premium NIW for both 2022 and 2021. We expect our production level for Single Premium Policies to fluctuate over time based on various factors, which include risk/return considerations and market conditions. 
 The following table provides selected information as of and for the periods indicated related to our mortgage insurance NIW. For direct Single Premium Policies, NIW includes policies written on an individual basis (as each loan is originated) and on an aggregated basis (in which each individual loan in a group of loans is insured in a single transaction, typically after the loans have been originated).

 Insurance and Risk in Force 
 Our IIF is the primary driver of the future premiums that we expect to earn over time. 
 IIF at December 31, 2022, increased as compared to the same period last year, due to the positive impact from our NIW in 2022 and higher Persistency Rates, as further discussed below. Historically, there has been a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates. Higher interest rate environments generally decrease refinancings, which decrease the cancellation rate of our insurance and positively affect our Persistency Rates. As shown in the table below, our 12-month Persistency Rate at December 31, 2022, increased as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in our Persistency Rate in 2022 was primarily attributable to the decline in refinance activity due to increases in mortgage interest rates, as compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2022, 5 of our IIF had a mortgage note interest rate greater than 6.0 . Excluding the 2022 vintage, less than 1 of our IIF had a mortgage note interest rate greater than 6.0 . Given the recent increase in market mortgage interest rates, which, based on reported industry averages, now exceed that level, we would expect a continued positive impact on our Persistency Rates. 
 As discussed above, our earnings in future periods are subject to elevated risks and uncertainties related to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including housing prices, inflationary pressures, unemployment levels, interest rate changes and the availability of credit. For additional information, in Item 1A. Risk Factors, see The credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages . 
 While these risks and uncertainties are elevated in the near-term, we continue to believe that the long-term housing market fundamentals and outlook remain positive, including demographics supporting growth in the population of first-time

homebuyers and a relatively constrained supply of homes available for sale. In addition, historical loan performance data indicates that credit scores and underwriting quality are key drivers of credit performance, and loan originations after 2008 have consisted primarily of high credit quality loans with significantly better credit performance than loans originated during 2008 and prior periods.

 Risk Distribution 
 We use third-party reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business as part of our risk distribution strategy, including to manage our capital position and risk profile. When we enter into a reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, insures an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. While these arrangements have the impact of reducing our earned premiums, they also reduce our required capital, potentially mitigate losses, and are expected to increase our return on required capital for the related policies. 
 The impact of these programs on our financial results will vary depending on the level of ceded RIF, as well as the levels of prepayments and incurred losses on the reinsured portfolios, among other factors. See Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage Risk Distribution above and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our reinsurance transactions.

Revenues 
 Net Premiums Earned. The decrease in net premiums earned for 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily driven by a decrease in net premiums earned in both our mortgage insurance and title insurance businesses in 2022.

 Services Revenue. Services revenue for 2022 decreased compared to 2021, primarily driven by the general market decline in mortgage origination volume as well as other market and macroeconomic conditions, as further described above in Overview Current Operating Environment.

 Net Investment Income. The increase in net investment income for 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily attributable to higher market interest rates in 2022. See Overview Current Operating Environment and Results of Operations Mortgage Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Revenues Net Investment Income for more information. 
 Net Gains (Losses) on Investments and Other Financial Instruments. The net losses on investments and other financial instruments for 2022, as compared to net gains in 2021, is primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates in 2022, as well as other market and macroeconomic conditions, as further discussed above in Overview Current Operating Environment. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments by investment category. 
 Expenses 
 Provision for Losses. The change in provision for losses for 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily driven by favorable development on prior year defaults, which impacted our mortgage insurance reserves. See Results of Operations Mortgage Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Expenses Provision for Losses for more information. 
 Cost of Services. Cost of services for 2022 decreased as compared to 2021, primarily driven by the decrease in services revenue as discussed above in Overview Current Operating Environment.

 Other Operating Expenses. The increase in other operating expenses for 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to: (i) an increase in salaries and other base employee expenses, including 14.7 million of severance and related expenses in 2022; (ii) an increase in other general operating expenses; (iii) an increase in impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items including 14.9 million in 2022, primarily related to our lease agreements; and (iv) a decrease in ceding commissions. These increases in other operating expenses were partially offset by a net decrease in variable and share-based incentive compensation expense.

 Income Tax Provision 
 Our 2022 effective tax rate was 22 , higher than the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and certain permanent book-to-tax adjustments. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our provision for income taxes. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the traditional GAAP financial measures, we have presented adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity, which are non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated company, among our key performance indicators to evaluate our fundamental financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way our business performance is evaluated by both management and by our board of directors. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although on a consolidated basis, adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are non-GAAP financial measures, for the reasons discussed above we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations.

 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Total adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are not measures of overall profitability, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share or return on equity. Our definitions of adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity, as discussed and reconciled below to the most comparable respective GAAP measures, may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. 
 Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian s chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of our business segments and to allocate resources to the segments. 
 Adjusted pretax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP consolidated pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments, except for certain investments attributable to our reportable segments and All Other activities; (ii) gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt; (iii) amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and (iv) impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items, such as impairment of internal-use software, gains (losses) from the sale of lines of business and acquisition-related income and expenses. 
 Although adjusted pretax operating income (loss) excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent those that are: (i) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (ii) not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss). These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated pretax income to our non-GAAP financial measure for the consolidated Company of adjusted pretax operating income.

 (2) Amounts primarily relate to impairment of other long-lived assets and are included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (3) Total adjusted pretax operating income on a consolidated basis consists of adjusted pretax operating income (loss) for our Mortgage segment, homegenius segment and All Other activities, as further detailed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing (i) adjusted pretax operating income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, net of taxes computed using the Company s statutory tax rate, by (ii) the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Revenues 
 Net Premiums Earned. Net premiums earned decreased for 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to: (i) a decrease in the impact, net of reinsurance, from Single Premium Policy cancellations due to lower refinance activity and (ii) a decrease in premiums earned on our Monthly Premium Policies due to lower average premium yields. These items were partially offset by an increase in the profit commission retained by the Company under our reinsurance programs, due to favorable reserve development in 2022. 
 The table below provides additional information about the components of mortgage insurance net premiums earned for the periods indicat ed, including the effects of our reinsurance programs.

 (6) Calculated by dividing net premiums earned by average primary IIF. The calculation for all periods presented incorporates the impact of profit commission adjustments related to our reinsurance programs.

See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 (7) The average of beginning and ending balances of primary IIF, for each period presented. 
 Over the past several years, we have experienced a decline in our in force portfolio premium yield due to a number of factors, including the pricing and credit mix of recent NIW compared to the policies that have been cancelled. Based on current NIW pricing and the impact of higher Persistency Rates we have been experiencing, we currently expect our in force portfolio premium yield in 2023 to be relatively stable; however, due to the potential impacts of Single Premium Policy cancellations and reinsurance, among other things, the net premium yield may continue to fluctuate from period to period. 
 The level of mortgage prepayments affects the revenue ultimately produced by our mortgage insurance business and is influenced by the mix of business we write. See Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage IIF and Related Drivers above for more information.

 (4) Calculated by dividing provision for losses for new defaults, net of reinsurance, by the number of new primary defaults for each period. 
 Our mortgage insurance provision for losses improved by 358.8 million during 2022 compared to 2021, resulting in a benefit of 339.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Current year new primary defaults were relatively flat for 2022, as compared to 2021, as shown below. Our gross Default to Claim Rate assumption for new primary defaults was 8.0 at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, as we continue to closely monitor the trends in Cures and claims paid for our default inventory, while also weighing the risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment. 
 Our provision for losses during 2022 and 2021 was positively impacted by favorable reserve development on prior year defaults, primarily as a result of more favorable trends in Cures than originally estimated due to favorable outcomes resulting from mortgage forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as positive trends in home price appreciation. These favorable observed trends resulted in reductions in our Default to Claim Rate assumptions for prior year default notices, particularly for those defaults first reported in 2020 following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Notes 1 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. 
 Our primary default rate at December 31, 2022, was 2.2 compared to 2.9 at December 31, 2021. The following table shows a rollforward of the number of our primary loans in default.

 We develop our Default to Claim Rate estimates on defaulted loans based on models that use a variety of loan characteristics to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our Default to Claim Rate assumptions. 
 Our aggregate weighted-average net Default to Claim Rate assumption for our primary defaulted loans used in estimating our reserve for losses, which is net of estimated Claim Denials and Rescissions, was approximately 30 and 46 , at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of defaults as of December 31, 2022, given the larger proportion of loans with fewer missed payments. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our reserve for losses and a reconciliation of our Mortgage segment s beginning and ending reserves for losses and LAE. 
 Although expected claims are included in our reserve for losses, the timing of claims paid is subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter, based on the rate that defaults cure and other factors, including the impact of foreclosure moratoriums (as further described in Item 1. Business Mortgage Defaults and Claims ), which make the timing of paid claims difficult to predict.

 Cost of Services. Cost of services for 2022 decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to the decrease in services revenue, as discussed above. Our cost of services is primarily affected by our level of services revenue. 
 Other Operating Expenses. The increase in other operating expenses for 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to: (i) a decrease in ceding commissions, due primarily to a decline in Single Premium Policy cancellations covered by our Single Premium QSR Program and (ii) an increase in salaries and other base employee expenses primarily driven by 8.2 million in severance-related expenses in 2022, most notably in the fourth quarter. These items were partially offset by a decrease in performance-based variable and share-based compensation expense in 2022.

Results of Operations homegenius 
 The following table summarizes our homegenius segment s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As discussed in Overview Current Operating Environment, the macroeconomic stresses beginning in the second quarter of 2022 impacted our homegenius businesses, including in particular a decrease in our title revenues due to the rapid decline in industrywide refinance volumes. We expect this trend to continue to impact the results of our homegenius segment in at least the near-term based on current market conditions and our expectation that overall refinance volumes will remain low.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Revenues 
 Net Premiums Earned. Net premiums earned for 2022 decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in new title policies written in our title insurance business. 
 Services Revenue. Services revenue for 2022 decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in title services revenues resulting from the recent macroeconomic stresses, as described above. 
 Expenses 
 Cost of Services. Cost of services for 2022 decreased compared to 2021, primarily due to the decrease in services revenue. Our cost of services is primarily affected by our level of services revenue and the number of employees providing those services. 
 Other Operating Expenses. The increase in other operating expenses for 2022 as compared to 2021 reflects an increase in salaries and other base employee expenses, driven primarily: (i) through the first half of the year by higher staffing levels and (ii) beginning in the second half of the year, and in light of the current economic and operating environments, by steps taken to align our workforce to the current and expected needs of this business, which resulted in 6.4 million of

severance-related expenses in 2022, most notably in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, other general operating expenses were also higher in 2022 as compared to 2021 as a result of additional strategic investments in 2022 focused on title and real estate technology businesses.

 Consolidated Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. 
 Summary cash flows - Consolidated Years Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 388,298 557,112 658,434 Investing activities (5,175) (1,862) (883,180) Financing activities (479,183) (496,776) 222,618 Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash (96,060) 58,474 (2,128) 
 Operating Activities. Our most significant source of operating cash flows is from premiums received from our mortgage insurance policies, while our most significant uses of operating cash flows are typically for our operating expenses, claims paid on our mortgage insurance policies and taxes. The 169 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, was principally due to higher purchases of U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds and higher other operating expenses. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales and redemptions, net of purchases, on fixed-maturity investments available for sale, partially offset by: (i) an

increase in sales and redemptions of trading securities; (ii) an increase in sales and redemptions, net of purchases, of short-term investments; and (iii) a decrease in purchases of equity securities. 
 Financing Activities. For 2022, our primary financing activities included: (i) repurchases of our common shares; (ii) payment of dividends; and (iii) net changes in secured borrowings. See Notes 12 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our borrowings and share repurchases, respectively.

 Liquidity Analysis Holding Company 
 Radian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. At December 31, 2022, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of 903 million. Available liquidity at December 31, 2022, excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries to pay for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn 275 million unsecured revolving credit facility, as described below, was 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
 During 2022, Radian Group s available liquidity increased by 298 million, due primarily to: (i) the return of capital from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group of 500 million and 282 million paid in February 2022 and December 2022, respectively, and (ii) the 100 million repayment in December 2022 by Radian Guaranty to Radian Group of the Surplus Note due 2027. These increases were partially offset by payments for share repurchases and dividends. See Notes 14 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for addition information.

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

In addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group s principal sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements; (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities; and (iii) to the extent available, dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries. 
 Radian Group has in place a 275 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2026, although under certain conditions Radian Group may need to offer to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate lender commitments earlier than the maturity date. Subject to certain limitations, borrowings under the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries as well as growth initiatives. At December 31, 2022, the full 275 million remains undrawn and available under the facility. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 In connection with our new mortgage conduit, Radian Mortgage Capital has entered into the Master Repurchase Agreements, each of which is an uncommitted 300 million mortgage loan repurchase facility to finance the acquisition of residential mortgage loans and related mortgage loan assets. Radian Group has entered into separate Parent Guarantees to guaranty the obligations under the Master Repurchase Agreements. Under these Parent Guarantees, Radian Group is subject to negative and affirmative covenants customary for this type of financing transaction, including compliance with financial covenants that are generally consistent with the comparable covenants in the Company s revolving credit facility. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition to financing the acquisition of mortgage loan assets under the Master Repurchase Agreements, Radian Mortgage Capital may fund such purchases directly using capital contributed from Radian Group. 
 We expect Radian Group s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months to be: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations; (iii) the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock, which were 0.20 per share in 2022 and subsequently increased to 0.225 per share for the first quarterly dividend in 2023, and which remain subject to approval by our board of directors and our ongoing assessment of our financial condition and potential needs related to the execution and implementation of our business plans and strategies; (iv) the potential continued repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to share repurchase authorizations, as described below; (v) investments to support our business strategy, including capital contributions to our subsidiaries; and (vi) potential payments pursuant to the Parent Guarantees. 
 In addition to our ongoing short-term liquidity needs discussed above, our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior debt due in future years. See Capitalization Holding Company below for details of our debt maturity profile. Radian Group s liquidity demands for the next 12 months or in future periods could also include: (i) early repurchases or redemptions of portions of our debt obligations and (ii) additional investments to support our business strategy, including additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. For additional information about related risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, including Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations . and Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity . See also Overview above and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 We believe that Radian Group has sufficient current sources of liquidity to fund its obligations. If we otherwise decide to increase our liquidity position, Radian Group may seek additional capital, including by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Share Repurchases. During 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased 19.5 million shares and 17.8 million shares of Radian Group common stock, respectively, under programs authorized by Radian Group s board of directors, at a total cost of 400 million and 399 million, respectively, including commissions. No purchase authority remains available under these programs. In January 2023, Radian Group s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to spend up to 300 million, excluding commissions, to repurchase Radian Group common stock through January 2025. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our share repurchase programs. 
 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Throughout 2022, our quarterly common stock dividend was 0.20 per share. On February 15, 2023, Radian Group s board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend from 0.20 to 0.225 per share. Based on our current outstanding shares of common stock and RSUs, we expect to require approximately 141 million in the aggregate to pay dividends and dividend equivalents for the next 12 months. So long as no default or event of default exists under our revolving credit facility or the Parent Guarantees, Radian Group is not subject to any legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation s capital surplus or (subject to certain limitations) recent net profits. As of December 31, 2022, our capital surplus was 3.8 billion, representing our dividend limitation under Delaware law. The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to the board of directors discretion and determination. 
 Corporate Expenses and Interest Expense. Radian Group has expense-sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group s outstanding debt obligations. Corporate expenses and interest 
 94 

Table of Contents

expense on Radian Group s debt obligations allocated under these arrangements during 2022 of 163 million and 83 million, respectively, were substantially all reimbursed by its subsidiaries. We expect substantially all of our holding company expenses to continue to be reimbursed by our subsidiaries under our expense-sharing arrangements. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time. 
 Taxes. Pursuant to our tax-sharing agreements, our operating subsidiaries pay Radian Group an amount equal to any federal income tax the subsidiary would have paid on a standalone basis if they were not part of our consolidated tax return. As a result, from time to time, under the provisions of our tax-sharing agreements, Radian Group may pay to or receive from its operating s ubsidiaries amounts that differ from Radian Group s consolidated federal tax payment obligation. During 2022, Radian Group received 15 million o f tax-sharing agreement payments from its operating subsidiaries. 
 Capitalization Holding Company

 Stockholders equity decreased by 339 million from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022. The net decrease in stockholders equity resulted primarily from net unrealized losses on investments of 577 million, primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates during the year, share repurchases of 400 million, and dividends of 137 million, partially offset by our net income of 743 million. Given our intent and ability as of December 31, 2022, to hold these investments until recovery of their amortized cost basis, we do not expect to realize a loss on any of our investments in an unrealized loss position. 
 We regularly evaluate opportunities, based on market conditions, to finance our operations by accessing the capital markets or entering into other types of financing arrangements with institutional and other lenders. We also regularly consider various measures to improve our capital and liquidity positions, as well as to strengthen our balance sheet, improve Radian Group s debt maturity profile and maintain adequate liquidity for our operations. Among other things, these measures may include borrowing agreements or arrangements, such as securities or other master repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities. In the past we have repurchased and exchanged, prior to maturity, some of our outstanding debt, and in the future, we may from time to time seek to redeem, repurchase or exchange for other securities, or otherwise restructure or refinance some or all of our outstanding debt prior to maturity in the open market through other public or private transactions, including pursuant to one or more tender offers or through any combination of the foregoing, as circumstances may allow. The timing or amount of any potential transactions will depend on a number of factors, including market opportunities and our views regarding our capital and liquidity positions and potential future needs. There can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Mortgage 
 Historically, one of the primary demands for liquidity in our Mortgage business is the payment of claims, net of reinsurance, including from commutations and settlements. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our mortgage insurance reserve for losses and LAE, which represents our best estimate for the costs of settling 
 95 

Table of Contents 
 Glossary 
 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

future claims on currently defaulted mortgage loans. Other principal demands for liquidity in our Mortgage business include: (i) expenses (including those allocated from Radian Group); (ii) repayments of FHLB advances; and (iii) taxes, including potential additional purchases of U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds. See Notes 10 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these non-interest-bearing instruments. In addition to the foregoing liquidity demands, other payments have included and, in the future could include, distributions from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group, including returns of capital or recurring ordinary dividends, as discussed below. 
 The principal sources of liquidity in our Mortgage business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from: (i) investment sales and maturities; (ii) FHLB advances; and (iii) if necessary, capital contributions from Radian Group. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their needs for the foreseeable future. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our mortgage insurance subsidiaries maintained claims paying resources of 5.7 billion on a statutory basis, which consist of contingency reserves, statutory policyholders surplus, premiums received but not yet earned and loss reserves. In addition, our reinsurance programs are designed to provide additional claims-paying resources during times of economic stress and elevated losses. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Radian Guaranty s Risk-to-capital as of December 31, 2022, was 10.7 to 1. Radian Guaranty is not expected to need additional capital to satisfy state insurance regulatory requirements in their current form. At December 31, 2022, Radian Guaranty had statutory policyholders surplus of 758 million. This balance includes a 596 million benefit from U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which mortgage guaranty insurers such as Radian Guaranty may purchase in order to be eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, related to amounts required to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. 
 Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs. Private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, are required to comply with the PMIERs to remain approved insurers of loans purchased by the GSEs. At December 31, 2022, Radian Guaranty s Available Assets under the PMIERs financial requirements totaled approximately 5.6 billion, resulting in a PMIERs Cushion of 1.7 billion, or 45 , over its Minimum Required Assets. Those amounts compare to Available Assets and a PMIERs cushion of 5.4 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 
 The primary driver of the decrease in Radian Guaranty s PMIERs Cushion during 2022 is the increase in Minimum Required Assets, partially offset by the increase in Available Assets, reflecting positive cash flows from operating activities. During 2022, Radian Guaranty s Minimum Required Assets increased primarily as a result of an increase in primary RIF. 
 Our PMIERs Cushion at December 31, 2022, also includes a benefit from the current broad-based application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge that has reduced the total amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty otherwise would have been required to hold against pandemic-related defaults by approximately 200 million and 300 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, taking into consideration our risk distribution structures in effect as of those dates. The application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has reduced Radian Guaranty s PMIERs Minimum Required Assets, but we expect this impact will diminish over time. 
 See Item 1. Business Regulation Federal Regulation GSE Requirements for Mortgage Insurance Eligibility for more information about the Disaster Related Capital Charge. 
 Despite holding assets above the minimum statutory capital thresholds and PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of Radian s mortgage insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of Pennsylvania, their state of domicile. As a result of Radian Guaranty s negative unassigned surplus position in recent years, any distributions to Radian Group required the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Radian Guaranty sought and received such approval during 2022 to return capital by paying Extraordinary Distributions to Radian Group, including a 500 million distribution in February 2022 and a 282 million distribution in December 2022, which were paid in cash and marketable securities in the form of returns of paid-in capital. 
 Aided by the positive impacts of its merger with Radian Reinsurance in December 2022, Radian Guaranty had positive unassigned surplus of 258 million as of December 31, 2022. As a result, Radian Guaranty now has the ability to pay ordinary dividends beginning in the first quarter of 2023, subject to the preceding year s statutory net income and other limitations under Pennsylvania s insurance laws. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Radian Guaranty s merger with Radian Reinsurance and statutory dividend restrictions. 
 Radian Guaranty is a member of the FHLB. As a member, it may borrow from the FHLB, subject to certain conditions, which include requirements to post collateral and to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB stock. Advances from the FHLB may be used to provide low-cost, supplemental liquidity for various purposes, including to fund incremental investments. Radian s current strategy includes using FHLB advances as financing for general cash management and liquidity purposes. As of December 31, 2022, there were 154 million of FHLB advances outstanding. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

homegenius 
 As of December 31, 2022, our homegenius segment maintained cash and liquid investments totaling 63 million, including 44 million held by Radian Title Insurance. 
 Title insurance companies, including Radian Title Insurance, are subject to comprehensive state regulations, including minimum net worth requirements. Radian Title Insurance was in compliance with all of its minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2022. In the event the cash flows from operations of the homegenius segment are not adequate to fund all of its needs, including the regulatory capital needs of Radian Title Insurance, Radian Group may provide additional funds to the homegenius segment in the form of an intercompany note or other capital contribution, and if needed for Radian Title Insurance, subject to the approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Additional capital support may also be required for potential investments in new business initiatives to support our strategy of growing our businesses. 
 Liquidity levels may fluctuate depending on the levels and contractual timing of our invoicing and the payment practices of our homegenius clients, in combination with the timing of our homegenius segment s payments for employee compensation and to external vendors. The amount, if any, and timing of the homegenius segment s dividend paying capacity will depend primarily on the amount of excess cash flow generated by the segment.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 SEC guidance defines Critical Accounting Estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operation of the registrant. These items require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current and projected economic and housing environments, among other factors, in forming its estimates, assumptions and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding our significant accounting policies.

Mortgage Insurance Portfolio 
 Reserve for Losses and LAE 
 We establish reserves to provide for losses and LAE, which include the estimated costs of settling claims in our mortgage insurance portfolio, in accordance with the accounting standard regarding accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises. In our mortgage insurance business, the default and claim cycle begins with the receipt of a default notice from the loan servicer that a borrower has missed two consecutive monthly mortgage payments. We maintain an extensive database of default and claim payment history, and use models based on a variety of loan characteristics to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status. 
 With respect to loans that are in default, considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels. We use an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a roll rate analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate Default to Claim Rates based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default as well as the date that a loan goes into default. The Default to Claim Rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected Rescissions and Claim Denials, which have the effect of reducing our Default to Claim Rates. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the table detailing our Default to Claim Rate assumptions. 
 After estimating the Default to Claim Rate, we estimate Claim Severity based on recently observed severity rates within product type, type of insurance and Time in Default cohorts, as adjusted to account for anticipated differences in future results compared to recent trends. These severity estimates are then applied to individual loan coverage amounts to determine reserves. Similar to the Default to Claim Rate, Claim Severity also is impacted by the length of time that loans are in default and by our Loss Mitigation Activity. For claims under our Primary Mortgage Insurance, the coverage percentage is applied to the claim amount, which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest (for which our liability is contractually capped in accordance with the terms of our Master Policies) and certain expenses associated with the default, to determine our maximum liability. Therefore, Claim Severity generally increases the longer that a loan is in default. 
 We considered the sensitivity of first-lien loss reserve estimates at December 31, 2022, by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in Claim Severity and Default to Claim Rate estimates for primary loans, excluding any potential benefits from reinsurance. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, for every one percentage point change in primary Claim Severity (which we estimate to be 98 of defaulted risk exposure at December 31, 2022), we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately 4 million at December 31, 2022. Assuming all other factors remain constant, for every one percentage point change in our overall primary net Default to Claim Rate (which we estimate to be 30 at December 31, 2022, including our assumptions related to Loss Mitigation Activities), we estimated a 13 million change in our loss reserves at December 31, 2022. 
 Senior management regularly reviews the modeled frequency, Claim Severity and Loss Mitigation Activity estimates, which are based on historical trends, as described above. If recent emerging or projected trends, including related to current and future macroeconomic conditions, differ significantly from the historical trends used to develop the modeled estimates, management evaluates these trends and determines how they should be considered in its reserve estimates. 
 Estimating our case reserve for losses involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may prove to be inaccurate, especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of market volatility and economic uncertainty. These assumptions require management to use considerable judgment in estimating the rate at which these loans will result in claims and the amount of such claims. As such, there is uncertainty around our reserve estimate. 
 Premium Revenue Recognition 
 Premiums on mortgage insurance products are written on a recurring basis, either as monthly or annual premiums, or on a multi-year basis as a single premium. Monthly premiums written are earned as coverage is provided each month. For certain monthly policies where the billing is deferred for the first month s coverage period, currently to the end of the policy, we record a net premium receivable representing the present value of such deferred premiums that we estimate will be collected at that future date. We recognize changes in this receivable based on changes in the estimated amount and timing of such collections, including as a result of changes in observed trends as well as our periodic review of our servicing guide and our operations and collections practices. 
 Key assumptions supporting our estimate of this receivable include a collection rate and average life. During 2022, we made no changes to these assumptions. During 2021, we adjusted our assumptions for collectability and average life, which had an impact of increasing each of the net premium receivable and net premiums earned by 2 million. If the collection rate assumption increased or decreased by 500 basis points, it would result in a 4 million increase or decrease, respectively, in the net premium receivable and net premiums earned. If the average life assumption increased or decreased by one year, it would result in an approximate 3 million decrease or increase, respectively, in the net premium receivable and net premiums earned.

 Glossary 
 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Single premiums written are initially recorded as unearned premiums and earned over time based on the anticipated loss pattern and the estimated period of risk exposure, which is primarily derived from historical experience and other factors such as projected losses, premium type and projected contractual periods of risk based on original LTV. Our estimate for the single premium earnings pattern is updated periodically and subject to change given uncertainty as to the underlying loss development and duration of risk. There were no changes to our single premium earnings pattern estimate in 2022 or 2021. 
 Actual future experience that is different than expected loss development or policy cancellations could result in further material increases or decreases in the recognition of net premiums earned. Based on historical experience, losses are relatively low during the first two years after a loan is originated and then increase over a period of several years before declining; however, several factors can impact and change this cycle, including the economic environment, the quality of the underwriting of the loan, characteristics of the mortgage loan, the credit profile of the borrower, housing prices and unemployment rates. If the timing of losses were to shift, it could accelerate or decelerate our recognition of net premiums earned and could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Credit Losses and Other Impairments 
 Investments 
 We perform an evaluation of fixed-maturity securities available for sale each quarter to assess whether any decline in their fair value below cost is deemed to be a credit impairment recognized in earnings. Factors considered in our assessment for impairment include the extent to which the amortized cost basis is greater than fair value and the reasons for the decline in value. As of December 31, 2022, our gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were 581 million, which can fluctuate materially over time based on changes in market conditions. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairments related to investments. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Our estimated fair value measurements are intended to reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available. Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and the risks inherent in the inputs to the model. Changes in economic conditions and capital market conditions, including but not limited to, benchmark interest rate changes, credit spread changes, market volatility and changes in the value of underlying collateral, could cause actual results to differ materially from our estimated fair value measurements. 
 Nearly all of our financial instruments recorded at fair value relate to our investment portfolio which, including securities loaned to third-party borrowers under securities lending agreements, totaled 5.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The primary risks in our investment portfolio are interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk, namely the fair value sensitivity of our fixed income securities to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, respectively. We regularly analyze our exposure to interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk and have determined that the fair value of our investments is materially exposed to changes in both interest rates and credit spreads. For additional information regarding the sensitivity of our investment portfolio to these inputs, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 See also Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information pertaining to financial instruments at fair value and our valuation methodologies. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. At each balance sheet date, we assess our need for a valuation allowance and this assessment is based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Future realization of our deferred tax assets will ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (ordinary income or capital gains) within the applicable carryback and carryforward periods provided under the tax law. In making our assessment of the more likely than not standard, the weight assigned to the effect of both positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified. 
 We have determined that certain non-insurance entities within Radian may continue to generate taxable losses on a separate company basis in the near term and may not be able to fully utilize certain state and local NOLs on their state and local tax returns. Therefore, with respect to deferred tax assets relating to these state and local NOLs and other state timing adjustments, we retained a valuation allowance of 70 million and 83 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Estimated factors in this assessment include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future income and actual and planned business and operational changes. An amount up to the total valuation allowance currently recorded could be recognized if our assessment of realizability changes. Our assumptions around these items and the weight assigned to them have remained consistent in recent periods. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions. Examples of market risk include changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. We perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities by determining the potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market-risk-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in the above-mentioned market risks. 
 Interest-Rate Risk and Credit-Spread Risk 
 The primary market risks in our investment portfolio are interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk, namely the fair value sensitivity of our fixed income securities to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, respectively. We regularly analyze our exposure to interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk and have determined that the fair value of our investments is materially exposed to changes in both interest rates and credit spreads. As of December 31, 2022, we held 116 million of investment securities for trading purposes, representing less than 3 of our total investment portfolio. Accordingly, in presenting this discussion, we have not distinguished between trading and non-trading instruments. 
 We calculate the duration of our fixed income securities, expressed in years, in order to estimate the interest-rate sensitivity of these securities. The average duration of our total fixed income portfolio was 4.4 years and 4.5 years at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. To assist us in setting duration targets for the investment portfolio, we analyze: (i) the interest-rate sensitivities of our liabilities, including prepayment risk associated with premium cash flows and credit losses; (ii) entity specific cash flows under various economic scenarios; (iii) return, volatility and correlation of specific asset classes and the interconnection with our liabilities; and (iv) our current risk appetite. 
 Our stress analysis for interest rates is based on the change in fair value of our fixed income securities, assuming a hypothetical instantaneous and parallel 100-basis point increase in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, with all other factors remaining constant. The carrying value of our fixed income securities has a balance of 5.6 billion and 6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If interest rates experienced an increase of 100 basis points, our fixed income portfolio would decrease by 236 million and 282 million of the market value of the related fixed income portfolio for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Credit spread represents the additional yield on a fixed income security, above the risk-free rate, that is paid by an issuer to compensate investors for assuming the credit risk of the issuer and market liquidity of the fixed income security. We manage credit-spread risk on both an entity and group level, across issuer, maturity, sector and asset class. Our stress analysis for credit-spread risk is based on the change in fair value of our fixed income securities, assuming a hypothetical 100-basis point increase in all credit spreads, with the exception of U.S. Treasury and agency RMBS obligations for which we have assumed no change in credit spreads, and assuming all other factors remain constant. If credit spreads experienced an increase of 100 basis points, our fixed income portfolio would decrease by 201 million and 263 million of the market value of the related fixed income portfolio for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Actual shifts in credit spreads generally vary by issuer and security, based on issuer-specific and security-specific factors such as credit quality, maturity, sector and asset class. Within a given asset class, investment grade securities generally exhibit less credit-spread volatility than securities with lower credit ratings. At December 31, 2022, 95 of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade. 
 Our sensitivity analyses for interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk provide an indication of our investment portfolio s sensitivity to shifts in interest rates and credit spreads. However, the timing and magnitude of actual market changes may differ from the hypothetical assumptions used in our sensitivity calculations. 
 See Item 1. Business Investment Policy and Portfolio for a discussion of portfolio strategy and risk exposure. 
 Securities Lending Agreements. Radian Group and Radian Guaranty from time to time enter into short-term securities lending agreements with third-party borrowers for the purpose of increasing the income on our investment securities portfolio with limited incremental risk. Market factors, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices, may impact the timing or magnitude of cash outflows for the return of cash collateral. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of these securities included in the sensitivity analyses above was 85 million and 86 million, respectively. 
 We also have the right to request the return of the loaned securities at any time. For additional information on our securities lending agreements, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Radian Group Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Radian Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in common stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)3 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Valuation of First-Lien Primary Case Reserves for Mortgage Insurance Policies 
 
 As described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company establishes case reserves for losses on mortgage insurance policies for loans that are considered to be in default, as well as reserves for loss adjustment expenses and other reserves. As of December 31, 2022, first-lien primary case reserves were 398.9 million of the total 421.0 million of mortgage insurance loss reserves. Management s estimate of the case reserves for losses involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss. Management uses an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a roll rate analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate Default to Claim Rates based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default as well as the date that a loan goes into default. After estimating the Default to Claim Rate, management estimates Claim Severity based on the average of recently observed severity rates within product type, type of insurance, and Time in Default cohorts. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of first-lien primary case reserves for mortgage insurance policies is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing their estimates of the Default to Claim Rates and Claim Severity, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment in performing procedures relating to such estimates; (ii) the significant audit effort and subjectivity in evaluating the audit evidence related to the Default to Claim Rates and Claim Severity; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s valuation of first-lien primary case reserves for mortgage insurance policies, including controls over the development of the Default to Claim Rates and Claim Severity. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the case reserves for first-lien primary mortgage insurance policies using actual historical data, comparing this independent estimate to management s determined case reserves, and evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions related to the Default to Claim Rates and Claim Severity. Performing these procedures involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing Default to Claim Rates and Claim Severity assumptions based on data provided by management.

 reportable business segments Mortgage and homegenius. 
 Mortgage 
 Our Mortgage segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, as well as contract underwriting and other credit risk management solutions, to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. We provide our mortgage insurance products and services mainly through our wholly owned subsidiary, Radian Guaranty. 
 Private mortgage insurance plays an important role in the U.S. housing finance system because it promotes affordable home ownership and helps protect mortgage lenders and mortgage investors, as well as other beneficiaries such as the GSEs, by mitigating default-related losses on residential mortgage loans. Generally, these loans are made to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the purchase price for their home or, in the case of refinancings, have less than equity in their home. Private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these low down payment loans in the secondary mortgage market, almost all of which are currently sold to the GSEs. 
 Our total direct primary mortgage IIF and RIF were billion and billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, compared to billion and billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. In addition to providing private mortgage insurance, in the past we have participated in credit risk transfer programs developed by the GSEs as part of their initiative to distribute mortgage credit risk and increase the role of private capital in the mortgage market. In December 2022, we novated the insurance policies for all outstanding RIF resulting from our past participation in these programs to an unrelated third-party reinsurer. See Note 16 for additional information about this novation. 
 The GSEs and state insurance regulators impose various capital and financial requirements on our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. These include the PMIERs financial requirements, as well as Risk-to-capital and other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements. Failure to comply with these capital and financial requirements may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write or may prohibit them from writing insurance altogether. The GSEs and state insurance regulators possess significant discretion with respect to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and all aspects of their business. See Note 16 for additional information on PMIERs and other regulatory information. 
 homegenius 
 Our homegenius segment is primarily a fee-for-service business that offers an array of products and services to market participants across the real estate value chain. Our homegenius products and services include title, real estate and technology products and services offered primarily to consumers, mortgage lenders, mortgage and real estate investors, GSEs, real estate brokers and agents. These products and services help lenders, investors, consumers and real estate agents evaluate, manage, monitor, acquire and sell properties. They include SaaS solutions and platforms, as well as managed services, such as real estate owned asset management, single-family rental services and real estate valuation services. In addition, we provide title insurance and non-insurance title, closing and settlement services to mortgage lenders, GSEs and mortgage investors, as well as directly to consumers for residential mortgage loans. 
 See Note 4 for additional information about our reportable segments and All Other business activities. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 In assessing the Company s current financial condition and developing forecasts of future operations, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to potential factors impacting our financial and liquidity position. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that could affect amounts reported in our financial statements in future periods and that could cause actual results to be materially different from our estimates, including as a result of macroeconomic stresses such as inflation, slower economic growth and higher levels of unemployment.

months or less at the time of purchase. 
 Amortization of premium and accretion of discount are calculated principally using the interest method over the term of the investment. Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method. See Notes 5 and 6 for further discussion on investments. 
 We recognize an impairment as a loss for fixed-maturities available for sale on the consolidated statements of operations if: (i) we intend to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (iii) the present value of cash flows we expect to collect is less than the amortized cost basis of a security. In those instances, we record an impairment loss through earnings that varies depending on specific circumstances. If a sale is likely, the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Otherwise, unrealized losses on securities are separated into: (i) the portion of loss that represents the credit loss and (ii) the portion that is due to other factors. In evaluating whether a decline in value for other securities relates to an existing credit loss, we consider several factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 the extent to which the amortized cost basis is greater than fair value; 
 reasons for the decline in value (e.g., adverse conditions related to industry or geographic area, changes in financial condition to the issuers or underlying loan obligors); 
 any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; 
 the failure of the issuer to make a scheduled payment; 
 the financial position, access to capital and near-term prospects of the issuer, including the current and future impact of any specific events; and 
 our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. 
 If a credit loss is determined to exist, the impairment amount is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of future expected cash flows, limited to the difference between the carrying amount (i.e., fair value) and amortized cost. This credit loss impairment is included in net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments in the consolidated statements of operations, with an offset to an allowance for credit losses. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss impairment or a reversal of credit loss impairment.

monthly payments, which is when we consider a loan to be in default for financial statement and internal tracking purposes. We also establish reserves for associated LAE, consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process, including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process. 
 We do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default. We generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default. See Reserve for Premium Deficiency below for an exception to these general principles. 
 With respect to loans that are in default, considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels. We use an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a roll rate analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate Default to Claim Rates based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default as well as the date that a loan goes into default. The Default to Claim Rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected Loss Mitigation Activities, which have the effect of reducing our Default to Claim Rates. 
 After estimating the Default to Claim Rate, we estimate Claim Severity based on observed severity rates within product type, type of insurance and Time in Default cohorts. These severity estimates are then applied to individual loan coverage amounts to determine reserves. 
 Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments may occur for various reasons, including, without limitation, underwriting negligence, fraudulent applications and appraisals, breach of representations and warranties and inadequate documentation, primarily related to our insurance written in years prior to and including 2008. For our Loss Mitigation Activities, we incorporate a process referred to as a claims rebuttal process by which the insured or servicer of loans may challenge our decisions. Our estimate of future Loss Mitigation Activities incorporates our estimates of the likely outcomes of our claims rebuttal process based on historical practices. 
 Estimating our case reserve for losses involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of market volatility and economic uncertainty. These assumptions require management to use considerable judgment in estimating the rate at which these loans will result in claims and the amount of claims we expect to pay. As such, there is uncertainty around our reserve estimate. 
 Title Insurance 
 We establish reserves for estimated future claims payments on our title insurance policies at the time the related policy revenue is recorded. Our title insurance reserve for losses and LAE comprises estimates of both known claims and incurred but unreported claims expected to be paid in the future for policies issued as of the balance sheet date. 
 We provide for losses associated with these policies based upon our historical experience and other factors. However, by their nature, title claims can often be complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts, vary in number due to economic and market conditions such as an increase in mortgage foreclosures, and involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure. Due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic and market conditions, these estimates are subject to variability. 
 categories: first-lien and second-lien mortgage loans. 
 We did not require a first-lien or second-lien PDR as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.

million and million, respectively, representing the present values of million and million, respectively, in contractual deferred monthly premiums, after adjustments for the estimated collectability and timing of future billing. We recognize changes in this receivable based on changes in the estimated amount and timing of such collections, including as a result of changes in observed trends as well as our periodic review of our servicing guide and our operations and collections practices. Given the difference between the present value of the net premium receivable recorded and the contractual premiums due, such changes to the preceding factors could have a material effect on our results of operations in future periods if any changes are implemented. 
 Annual premiums written are initially recorded as unearned premiums and amortized on a monthly, straight-line basis. Single premiums written are initially recorded as unearned premiums and earned over time based on the anticipated claim payment pattern, which includes historical industry experience and is updated periodically. 
 When we rescind insurance coverage on a loan, we refund all premiums received in connection with such coverage. When insurance coverage on a loan is canceled due to claim payment, we refund all premiums received since the date of delinquency. When insurance coverage is cancelled for a reason other than Rescission or claim payment, all premium that is nonrefundable is immediately earned. Premium revenue is recognized net of our accrual for estimated premium refunds due to Rescissions or other factors. 
 With respect to our reinsurance transactions, ceded premiums written on an annual or multi-year basis are initially set up as prepaid reinsurance and are amortized in a manner consistent with the recognition of income on direct premiums. 
 Title Insurance and Related Services 
 Title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue upon closing and completion of the real estate transaction. Premiums generally are calculated with reference to the policy amount. Premiums are charged to customers based on rates predetermined in coordination with each state s respective Department of Insurance. Such regulations vary from state to state. Premium revenues from agency title operations are primarily comprised of premiums recognized upon title order and completion of real estate transaction closing.

Our homegenius segment offers an array of title, real estate and technology products and services to consumers, mortgage lenders, mortgage and real estate investors, GSEs, real estate brokers and agents. 
 In addition, we report as All Other activities that include: (i) income (losses) from assets held by Radian Group, our holding company; (ii) related general corporate operating expenses not attributable or allocated to our reportable segments; and (iii) certain investments in new business opportunities, including activities and investments associated with Radian Mortgage Capital, and other immaterial activities. 
 We allocate corporate operating expenses to both reportable segments based primarily on each segment s forecasted annual percentage of total revenue, which approximates the estimated percentage of management time spent on each segment. In addition, we allocate all corporate interest expense to our Mortgage segment, due to the capital-intensive nature of our mortgage insurance business. We do not manage assets by segment.

 Adjusted Pretax Operating Income (Loss) 
 Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian s chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of each of Radian s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments. 
 Adjusted pretax operating income (loss) is defined as pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments, except for certain investments attributable to our reportable segments and All Other activities; (ii) gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt; (iii) amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and (iv) impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items, such as impairment of internal-use software, gains (losses) from the sale of lines of business and acquisition-related income and expenses.

 Valuation Methodologies for Assets Measured at Fair Value 
 We are responsible for the determination of the value of all investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. To assist us in this responsibility, we utilize independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze and interpret market information and estimate fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for various asset classes and individual securities. 
 We perform monthly quantitative and qualitative analyses on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes: (i) a review of the methodology used by third-party pricing services; (ii) a comparison of pricing services valuations to other independent sources; (iii) a review of month-to-month price fluctuations; and (iv) a comparison of actual purchase and sale transactions with valuations received from third parties. These processes are designed to ensure that our investment values are accurately recorded, that the data inputs and valuation techniques utilized are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. 
 The following are descriptions of our valuation methodologies for financial assets measured at fair value. 
 U.S. Government and Agency Securities. The fair value of U.S. government and agency securities is estimated using observed market transactions, including broker-dealer quotes and actual trade activity as a basis for valuation. U.S. government and agency securities are categorized in either Level I or Level II of the fair value hierarchy. 
 State and Municipal Obligations. The fair value of state and municipal obligations is estimated using recent transaction activity, including market observations. Valuation models are used, which incorporate bond structure, yield curve, credit spreads and other factors. These securities are generally categorized in Level II of the fair value hierarchy or in Level III when market-based transaction activity is unavailable.

Other borrowings FHLB advances Mortgage financing facilities Total other borrowings 
 The fair value of our senior notes is estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our other borrowings is estimated based on contractual cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates for similar borrowing arrangements. These liabilities are categorized in Level II of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 12 for further information about these borrowings. The fair value of our remaining financial instruments included in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets approximates their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Given our intent and ability as of December 31, 2022, to hold these securities until recovery of their amortized cost basis, we do not expect to realize a loss on any of our investments in an unrealized loss position. See Note 2 for information regarding our accounting policy for impairments. 
 Loaned Securities 
 We participate in a securities lending program whereby we loan certain securities in our investment portfolio to third-party borrowers for short periods of time. These securities lending agreements are collateralized financing arrangements whereby we transfer securities to third parties through an intermediary in exchange for cash or other securities. However, pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we maintain effective control over all loaned securities. Although we report such securities at fair value within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, rather than within investments, the detailed information we provide in this Note 6 includes these securities. See Note 5 for additional detail on the loaned securities. 
 Under our securities lending agreements, the borrower is required to provide to us collateral, consisting of cash or securities, in amounts generally equal to or exceeding: (i) of the value of the loaned securities in the case of foreign securities) or (ii) another agreed-upon percentage not less than of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral we receive may be invested in liquid assets. Cash collateral, which is reinvested for our benefit by the intermediary in accordance with the investment guidelines contained in the securities lending and collateral agreements, is reflected in short-term investments, with an offsetting liability recognized in other liabilities for the obligation to return the cash collateral. Securities collateral we receive is held on deposit for the borrower s benefit and we may not transfer or loan such securities collateral unless the borrower is in default. Therefore, such securities collateral is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements given that the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to us from the borrowers. 
 Fees received and paid in connection with securities lending agreements are recorded in net investment income and interest expense, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 All of our securities lending agreements are classified as overnight and revolving. Securities collateral on deposit with us from third-party borrowers totaling million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, may not be transferred or re-pledged unless the third-party borrower is in default, and is therefore not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.

 QSR Program 
 2022 QSR Agreement 
 In the third quarter of 2022, Radian Guaranty entered into the 2022 QSR Agreement with a panel of third-party reinsurance providers to cede a contractual quota share percent of certain of our NIW, which includes both Recurring Premium Policies and Single Premium Policies (as set forth in the table below), subject to certain conditions, including a limitation on ceded RIF equal to billion over the term of the agreement. Radian Guaranty may discontinue ceding new policies under the agreement at the end of any calendar quarter. 
 Radian Guaranty receives a ceding commission for ceded premiums earned pursuant to these transactions. Radian Guaranty is also entitled to receive a profit commission quarterly, subject to a final annual re-calculation, provided that the loss ratio on the loans covered under the agreement generally remains below the applicable prescribed thresholds. Losses on the ceded risk up to these thresholds reduce Radian Guaranty s profit commission on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
 Single Premium QSR Program 
 Radian Guaranty entered into each of the 2016 Single Premium QSR Agreement, 2018 Single Premium QSR Agreement and 2020 Single Premium QSR Agreement with panels of third-party reinsurers to cede a contractual quota share percent of our Single Premium NIW as of the effective date of each agreement (as set forth in the table below), subject to certain conditions. 
 Radian Guaranty receives a ceding commission for ceded premiums written pursuant to these transactions. Radian Guaranty also receives a profit commission annually, provided that the loss ratio on the loans covered under the agreement

 (2) Radian Guaranty has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate any of the agreements at the end of any calendar quarter on or after the applicable optional termination date. If Radian Guaranty exercises this option in the future, it would result in Radian Guaranty reassuming the related RIF in exchange for a net payment to the reinsurers calculated in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Radian Guaranty also may terminate any of the agreements prior to the scheduled termination date under certain circumstances, including if one or both of the GSEs no longer grant full PMIERs credit for the reinsurance. 
 (3) Effective September 30, 2022, one reinsurer terminated its interest in the 2016 Single Premium QSR Agreement in exchange for participating in the 2022 QSR Agreement. As a result, the portions ceded under this agreement declined from to to approximately to as of September 30, 2022. 
 Excess-of-Loss Program 
 Radian Guaranty has entered into fully collateralized reinsurance arrangements with the Eagle Re Issuers, of which remain active as of December 31, 2022. For the respective coverage periods, Radian Guaranty retains the first-loss layer of aggregate losses, as well as any losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts. The Eagle Re Issuers provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding coverage amounts. For each of these reinsurance arrangements, the Eagle Re Issuers financed their coverage by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes to eligible capital markets investors in unregistered private offerings. The aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage for these arrangements decreases over the maturity period of the mortgage insurance-linked notes (either a -year or -year period depending on the transaction) as the principal balances of the underlying covered mortgages decrease and as any claims are paid by the applicable Eagle Re Issuer or the mortgage insurance is canceled. Radian Guaranty has rights to terminate the reinsurance agreements upon the occurrence of certain events, including an optional call feature that provides Radian Guaranty the right to terminate the transaction on or after the optional call date or years after the issuance of the insurance-linked notes depending on the transaction) and a right to exercise an optional clean-up call if the outstanding principal amount of the related insurance-linked notes falls below of the initial principal balance of the related insurance-linked notes.

 million original principal amount of the mortgage insurance-linked notes issued in connection with this reinsurance transaction, which are included in fixed-maturities available for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. See Notes 5 and 6 for additional information. 
 The Eagle Re Issuers are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Radian Guaranty. Based on the accounting guidance that addresses VIEs, we have not consolidated any of the assets and liabilities of the Eagle Re Issuers in our financial statements, because Radian does not have: (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Eagle Re Issuers economic performances or (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the Eagle Re Issuers that potentially could be significant to the Eagle Re Issuers. See Note 2 for more information on our accounting treatment of VIEs. 
 The reinsurance premium due to the Eagle Re Issuers is calculated by multiplying the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount at the beginning of a period by a coupon rate, which is the sum of one-month LIBOR (or an acceptable alternative to LIBOR) or SOFR, as applicable, plus a contractual risk margin, and then subtracting actual investment income collected on the assets in the reinsurance trust during the preceding month. As a result, the premiums we pay will vary based on: (i) the spread between LIBOR (or an acceptable alternative to LIBOR) or SOFR, as provided in each applicable reinsurance agreement, and the rates on the investments held by the reinsurance trust and (ii) the outstanding amount of reinsurance coverage. 
 As the reinsurance premium will vary based on changes in these rates, we concluded that the reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives, which we have accounted for separately as freestanding derivatives and recorded in other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of these embedded derivatives are recorded in net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments in our consolidated statements of operations.

 Other Collateral 
 Although we use reinsurance as one of our risk management tools, reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligations to our policyholders. In the event the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations to us, our insurance subsidiaries would be liable for any defaulted amounts. However, consistent with the PMIERs reinsurer counterparty collateral requirements, Radian Guaranty s reinsurers have established trusts to help secure our potential cash recoveries. In addition to the total VIE assets of the Eagle Re Issuers discussed above, the amount held in reinsurance trusts was million as of December 31, 2022, compared to million as of December 31, 2021. 
 In addition, primarily for the Single Premium QSR Program, Radian Guaranty holds amounts related to ceded premiums written to collateralize the reinsurers obligations, which is reported in reinsurance funds withheld on our consolidated balance sheets. Any loss recoveries and profit commissions paid to Radian Guaranty related to the Single Premium QSR Program are expected to be realized from this account.

Right-of-Use Assets 
 During 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our transition to a hybrid work environment, we made the decision to exit, and to actively market for sublease, all office space in our former corporate headquarters in downtown Philadelphia. As part of this change, we entered into new leases with reduced square footage, including our new corporate headquarters, effective September 2021, in Wayne, Pennsylvania and a Cherry Hill, New Jersey location. 
 As a result of this decision and our ongoing evaluation of all of our existing leases, future space needs and evolving sublease market conditions, we recognized impairments to our right-of-use assets of million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, we recognized impairments to related property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, of million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These impairments related primarily to our former corporate headquarters leases, and reduced the carrying value of certain lease assets and the related property and equipment to their estimated fair values. The right-of-use asset fair values were estimated using an income approach based on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the property based on projected sublease market rents, which could differ from actual results and require us to revise our estimates in future periods. Following these impairments, which were recorded within other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, the aggregate carrying value of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements related to the former corporate headquarters leases was million as of December 31, 2022.

 Current and Deferred Taxes 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our current federal income tax liability was million and million, respectively, which primarily relates to applying the standards of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, and is included as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 We are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. At each balance sheet date, we assess our need for a valuation allowance, and this assessment is based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. This requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether our deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. Certain entities within our consolidated group have generated net deferred tax assets relating primarily to state and local NOL carryforwards which, if unutilized, will expire during various future tax periods. We have determined that certain of these entities may continue to generate taxable losses on a separate company basis in the near term and may not be able to fully utilize certain of their state and local NOLs on their state and local tax returns. Therefore, we have concluded a valuation allowance is required with respect to deferred tax assets relating to these state and local NOLs and other state timing adjustments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, this valuation allowance was million and million, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we have generated deferred tax assets related to unrealized capital losses, and we consider it more likely than not that these assets will be realized. We will continue to monitor the level of these losses and our overall ability to realize the related deferred tax assets in the coming quarters. 
 As a mortgage guaranty insurer, we are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 832(e) for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. The deduction is allowed only to the extent that, in conjunction with quarterly federal tax payment due dates, we purchase non-interest-bearing U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from deducting any portion of our statutory contingency reserves. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held million and million, respectively, of these bonds, which are included as prepaid federal

 Our gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by million from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, primarily due to the impact of unrecognized tax benefits associated with our recognition of certain premium income, partially offset by reductions related to lapses of the statute of limitations. Although unrecognized tax benefits decreased due to statute expirations, certain amounts for premium income recognition continued to impact subsequent years, resulting in a corresponding increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to premium income recognition. Over the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately million due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to the 2019 tax year. The statute of limitations related to our federal consolidated income tax return remains open for tax years 2019-2022. Additionally, among the entities within our consolidated group, various tax years remain open to potential examination by state and local taxing authorities.

 Reserve Activity 
 Incurred Losses 
 Total incurred losses are driven by: (i) case reserves established for new default notices, which are primarily impacted by both the number of new primary default notices received in the period and our related gross Default to Claim Rate assumption applied to those new defaults and (ii) reserve developments on prior period defaults, which are primarily impacted by changes to our prior Default to Claim Rate assumptions. 
 New primary default notices totaled for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to for the year ended December 31, 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the significant number of new primary default notices were substantially all related to defaults of loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Our gross Default to Claim Rate assumption applied to new defaults was as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, compared to as of December 31, 2020. We continue to closely monitor the trends in Cures and claims paid for our default inventory, while also weighing the risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment. 
 Our provision for losses during 2022 and 2021 was positively impacted by favorable reserve development on prior year defaults, primarily as a result of more favorable trends in Cures than originally estimated, due to favorable outcomes resulting from mortgage forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as positive trends in home price appreciation. These favorable observed trends resulted in reductions in our Default to Claim Rate assumptions for prior year default notices, particularly for those defaults first reported in 2020 following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Our provision for losses during 2020 was also positively impacted by favorable reserve development on prior year defaults, primarily driven by a reduction in certain Default to Claim Rate assumptions for those prior year defaults based on observed trends. 
 Default to Claim Rate 
 Our Default to Claim Rate estimates on defaulted loans are mainly developed based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default of the underlying defaulted loans grouped according to the period in which the default occurred, as measured by the progress toward foreclosure sale and the number of months in default. While our estimates of ultimate losses on defaults from prior years declined in each recent year due to elevated Cures, which reduced our inventory of primary defaults, COVID-19-

Defaults not in Foreclosure Stage Time in Default: 5 years Foreclosure Stage Defaults 
 (1) Represents the weighted average Default to Claim Rate for all defaults not in foreclosure stage that have been in default for up to , including new defaults. The estimated Default to Claim Rates applied to defaults within this population vary by Time in Default, and range from the Default to Claim Rates on new defaults shown above, up to , and for more aged defaults in this category as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Our estimate of expected Rescissions and Claim Denials (net of expected Reinstatements) embedded in our estimated net Default to Claim Rate is generally based on our recent experience. Consideration is also given to differences in characteristics between those rescinded policies and denied claims and the loans remaining in our defaulted inventory. 
 Claims Paid 
 Total claims paid decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in claims paid is primarily attributable to a reduction in payments made to settle certain previously disclosed legal proceedings. 
 Concentration of Risk 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no state that accounted for more than 10 of our mortgage insurance business measured by primary RIF. Texas accounted for of our direct NIW for the year ended December 31, 2022, while California accounted for and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Additional Disclosures 
 The following tables provide information as of and for the periods indicated about: (i) incurred losses, net of reinsurance; (ii) the total of IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims, included within the net incurred loss amounts; (iii) the cumulative number of reported defaults; and (iv) cumulative paid claims, net of reinsurance. The default year represents the period that a new default notice is first reported to us by loan servicers, related to borrowers who missed monthly payments.

For obligations with maturities greater than or equal to days, we may prepay the debt at any time, subject to paying a prepayment fee. 
 The principal balance of the FHLB advances is required to be collateralized by eligible assets with a market value that must be maintained generally within a minimum range of to of the amount borrowed, depending on the type of assets pledged. Our fixed-maturities available for sale and trading securities include securities totaling million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which serve as collateral for our FHLB advances to satisfy this requirement. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 Radian Group has in place a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. The revolving credit facility matures in December 2026, although under certain conditions Radian Group may need to offer to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate lender commitments earlier than the maturity date. Terms of the credit facility include an accordion feature that allows Radian Group, at its option, to increase the total borrowing capacity during the term of the agreement, subject to our obtaining the necessary increased commitments from lenders (which may include then existing or other lenders), up to a total of million. 
 Subject to certain limitations, borrowings under the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to Radian Group s insurance subsidiaries as well as growth initiatives. The credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions. Our ability to borrow under the credit facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain financial and other covenants, including covenants related to minimum net worth and statutory surplus, a maximum debt-to-capitalization level, limits on certain types of indebtedness and liens, and Radian Guaranty s eligibility as a private mortgage insurer with the GSEs. At December 31, 2022, Radian Group was in compliance with all the covenants and there were amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility. 
 Mortgage Financing Facilities 
 In July 2022, Radian Mortgage Capital and its wholly owned subsidiary Liberty entered into the Goldman Sachs Master Repurchase Agreement, pursuant to which Liberty may from time to time sell to Goldman Sachs, and later repurchase, certain Participation Interests (as defined in the Goldman Sachs Master Repurchase Agreement) in residential mortgage loan assets. The Goldman Sachs Master Repurchase Agreement will terminate in July 2023, unless extended or terminated earlier. 
 In September 2022, Radian Mortgage Capital entered into the BMO Master Repurchase Agreement, pursuant to which Radian Mortgage Capital may from time to time sell to BMO, and later repurchase, certain residential mortgage loan assets. The BMO Master Repurchase Agreement will expire in September 2023, unless the agreement is extended or terminated earlier. 
 Both Master Repurchase Agreements are uncommitted, and Goldman Sachs and BMO are under no obligation to fund the purchase of any residential mortgage loan assets under their respective agreements. In the event Goldman Sachs or BMO advances funds to purchase residential mortgage loan assets, the amount of such advances generally will be calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance or market value of the residential mortgage loan assets, depending on the credit characteristics of the loans being purchased. 
 The Master Repurchase Agreements contain provisions that provide Goldman Sachs and BMO, respectively, with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market value of the purchased residential mortgage loan assets. Under these provisions, Liberty or Radian Mortgage Capital, as applicable, may be required to transfer cash or additional eligible residential mortgage loan assets with an aggregate market value that is equal to the difference between the value of the residential mortgage loan assets then subject to the applicable Master Repurchase Agreement and a minimum threshold amount. 
 Radian Group has entered into the Parent Guarantees to guaranty the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries in connection with the Master Repurchase Agreements described above. 
 Pursuant to the Parent Guarantees, Radian Group is subject to negative and affirmative covenants customary for this type of financing transaction, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of debt and restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates, payments and investments and various financial covenants that the Company must remain in

 after such right first arose for primary insurance and within for certain other policies, including certain Pool Mortgage Insurance policies. Although we believe that our Loss Mitigation Activities are justified under our policies, from time to time we face challenges from certain lender and servicer customers regarding our Loss Mitigation Activities. These challenges could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings and we may need to reassume the risk on, and increase loss reserves for, the associated policies or pay additional claims. 
 
 Management believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of currently pending or threatened actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. The outcome of legal actions and proceedings is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that any one or more matters could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for any particular period. In accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance, we establish accruals only when we determine both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We accrue the amount that represents our best estimate of the probable loss; however, if we can only determine a range of estimated losses, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome, and if none of the estimates within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. 
 Legal actions and proceedings could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief that could require significant expenditures or have other effects on our business in excess of amounts we have established as reserves for such matters. Loss estimates are inherently subjective, based on currently available information and are subject to management s judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherently subjective nature of these estimates and the uncertainty and unpredictability surrounding the outcome of legal and other proceedings, actual results may differ materially from any amounts that have been accrued. 
 Lease Liability 
 Our lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate, on a collateralized basis, to

 Share Repurchase Activity 
 From time to time, Radian Group s board of directors approves share repurchase programs authorizing the Company to repurchase Radian Group common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Radian generally operates its share repurchase programs pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which permits the Company to purchase shares, at predetermined price targets, when it may otherwise be precluded from doing so. 
 In February 2022, Radian Group s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to spend up to million, excluding commissions, to repurchase Radian Group common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. The authorization was originally set to expire in February 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased million shares at an average price of per share, including commissions, completing this repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, purchase authority remained available under this share repurchase program. 
 In January 2023, Radian Group s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to spend up to million, excluding commissions, to repurchase Radian Group common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Radian plans to utilize a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which, once implemented, permits the Company to purchase shares, at predetermined price targets, when it may otherwise be precluded from doing so. The authorization will expire in January 2025. 
 Other Purchases 
 We may purchase shares on the open market to settle stock options exercised by employees. In addition, upon the vesting of certain RSUs under our equity compensation plans, we may withhold from such vested awards shares of our common stock to satisfy the tax liability of the award recipients. 
 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents 
 We declared quarterly cash dividends on our common stock equal to per share during each quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 and declared quarterly cash dividends on our common stock equal to per share for the remaining quarters of 2021. In February 2022, Radian Group s board of directors authorized an increase to the Company s quarterly dividend from to per share, beginning with the dividend declared in the first quarter of 2022. In February 2023, Radian Group s board of directors authorized an increase in the Company s quarterly dividend from to per share for the first quarter of 2023. 
 Dividend equivalents are accrued on RSUs when dividends are declared on the Company s common stock, subject to certain exclusions. See Note 17 for information about our dividend equivalents on RSU awards.

 principal subsidiary, Radian Guaranty. Radian Guaranty is authorized as a monoline insurer to write mortgage guaranty insurance (or in states where there is no specific authorization for mortgage guaranty insurance, the applicable line of insurance under which mortgage guaranty insurance is regulated) in all states, the District of Columbia and Guam. 
 As part of our title services, we offer title insurance through Radian Title Insurance, which is domiciled in Ohio and licensed to issue title insurance policies in states and the District of Columbia. 
 In addition to complying with state insurance regulations, in order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer, as well as the approved insurer s financial condition. See PMIERs below for additional information. 
 The PMIERs and state insurance regulations include various capital requirements and dividend restrictions based on our insurance subsidiaries statutory financial position and results of operations, as described below. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition. 
 Recent Capital Actions 
 As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance financial flexibility and improve operational efficiency, we completed the following series of capital actions during the fourth quarter of 2022 affecting our mortgage insurance subsidiaries: 
 Effective December 1, 2022, Radian Reinsurance completed the novation to an unrelated third-party insurer of its entire insured portfolio of credit risk transfer transactions with the GSEs. Under the terms of the novation agreements, which were approved by the GSEs, the third-party insurer assumed all rights, interests, liabilities and obligations under the credit risk transfer transactions originally insured by Radian Reinsurance, which totaled million of risk in force as of September 30, 2022.

million that were merged into Radian Guaranty effective for the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Following completion of the merger of Radian Reinsurance into Radian Guaranty, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approved a million return of capital from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group, which was paid from Radian Guaranty s gross paid in and contributed statutory surplus on December 30, 2022. In addition, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department also approved the early repayment from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group of the Surplus Note due 2027, which was also repaid on December 30, 2022. 
 See Statutory Dividend Restrictions below for further discussion of the impact these actions had on Radian Guaranty s ability to pay ordinary dividends. 
 Statutory Financial Statements 
 We prepare our statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices required or permitted, if applicable, by the insurance departments of the respective states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries. Required SAP are established by the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. In addition, insurance departments have the right to permit other specific practices that may deviate from prescribed practices. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any prescribed or permitted SAP that resulted in reported statutory surplus or risk-based capital being materially different from what would have been reported had NAIC statutory accounting practices been followed. 
 Reflecting the principal differences between SAP and GAAP, statutory financial statements typically do not include unrealized gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities, deferred policy acquisition costs, certain net deferred tax assets and certain other less readily marketable assets that are designated as non-admitted assets. In addition to these general differences, SAP also requires that mortgage insurance companies establish a special contingency reserve equal to of premiums earned in each year, generally to be maintained for years, to protect policyholders against loss during adverse economic cycles. 
 As a result of the requirement to establish and maintain this statutory liability, contingency reserves affect the ability of a mortgage insurer to pay dividends, as described below. With regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from this contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed of net premiums in a calendar year. Radian Guaranty did not release any amounts from its contingency reserves in 2022 or 2021. Based on the typical -year holding requirement, Radian Guaranty is scheduled to release contingency reserves to unassigned surplus in material amounts beginning in 2024. See Statutory Dividend Restrictions below for additional information. 
 As a mortgage guaranty insurer, we are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, related to amounts required to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves to the extent we purchase U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Under SAP, this deduction reduces the tax provision reflected in the statutory financial statements, which in turn increases statutory net income and surplus as well as Available Assets under the PMIERs. As of December 31, 2022, Radian Guaranty held million of these bonds, which have a -year original maturity but may generally be redeemed in any tax year prior to maturity.

previous insurance subsidiaries, Radian Mortgage Guaranty Inc. and Radian Investor Surety Inc., which were dissolved in 2021. 
 Statutory Capital Requirements 
 Under state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a maximum ratio of net RIF relative to statutory capital, or Risk-to-capital. There are RBC States that currently impose a Statutory RBC Requirement. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer s Risk-to-capital may not exceed to 1. In certain of the RBC States, a mortgage insurer must satisfy an MPP Requirement. Unless an RBC State grants a waiver or other form of relief, if a mortgage insurer, such as Radian Guaranty, is not in compliance with the Statutory RBC Requirement of that state, the mortgage insurer may be prohibited from writing new mortgage insurance business in that state. 
 The statutory capital requirements for the non-RBC States are de minimis (ranging from million to million); however, the insurance laws of these states generally grant broad supervisory powers to state agencies or officials to enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company s ability to write new business. Radian Guaranty s domiciliary state, Pennsylvania, is not one of the RBC States. 
 Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements and MPP Requirements in each of the RBC States as of December 31, 2022. Radian Guaranty s Risk-to-capital was :1 and :1 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For purposes of the Risk-to-capital requirements imposed by certain states, statutory capital is defined as the sum of statutory policyholders surplus plus statutory contingency reserves. 
 Our other mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries were also in compliance with all statutory and counterparty capital requirements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 For many years, the NAIC has been considering changes to the Model Act and has been reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers. In 2021, the NAIC developed a new, legally non-binding capital monitoring framework that regulators could use as an alternative for assessing the capital adequacy of a mortgage insurer and added a new mortgage guaranty supplemental filing for companies to annually report related information. This monitoring framework, which is separate from the Model Act, is intended to be reactive to, among other things, changes in the economic and housing environment, including changes in home prices and incomes. In October 2022, the NAIC publicly released a new exposure draft of a revised Model Act (the 2022 Exposure Draft for comment. With respect to minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers, the 2022 Exposure Draft largely preserves the same requirements as exist in the current Model Act. The outcome of the new Model Act process remains subject to change, and therefore, the potential impact on the Company cannot be determined and, among other things, will depend on whether the NAIC adopts final changes to the Model Act and which states, if any, ultimately adopt the new Model Act. 
 PMIERs 
 The PMIERs financial requirements require that a mortgage insurer s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. At December 31, 2022, Radian Guaranty is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs and is in compliance with the current PMIERs financial requirements. 
 The GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time, and they have broad discretion to interpret the requirements, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. In addition, the GSEs have a broad range of consent rights under the PMIERs and require private mortgage insurers to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking certain actions. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, the GSEs could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty. 
 Statutory Dividend Restrictions 
 As of December 31, 2022, the amount of restricted net assets held by our consolidated insurance subsidiaries (which represents our equity investment in those insurance subsidiaries) totaled billion of our consolidated net assets. Despite holding assets above the minimum statutory capital thresholds and PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of Radian s mortgage insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock has been restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of Pennsylvania, their state of domicile. 
 Under Pennsylvania s insurance laws, ordinary dividends and distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s positive unassigned surplus unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approves the payment of extraordinary dividends or other distributions from another source. Prior to the beneficial impact to unassigned surplus from the merger with Radian Reinsurance discussed above, Radian Guaranty had negative unassigned surplus of million as of December 31, 2021.

million distribution in February 2022 and a million distribution in December 2022, which were paid in cash and marketable securities in the form of returns of paid-in capital. 
 While all proposed dividends and distributions to stockholders must be filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department prior to payment, if a Pennsylvania domiciled insurer has positive unassigned surplus, such insurer can pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10 of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders surplus or (ii) the preceding year s statutory net income, in each case without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Aided by the positive impacts of the merger with Radian Reinsurance in December 2022, Radian Guaranty had positive unassigned surplus of million as of December 31, 2022. As a result, Radian Guaranty now has the ability to pay ordinary dividends beginning in the first quarter of 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Radian Guaranty had contingency reserves of billion and billion, respectively. As discussed above, absent early releases related to elevated incurred losses, Radian Guaranty is scheduled to release contingency reserves to unassigned surplus in material amounts beginning in 2024, which should enhance Radian Guaranty s ability to maintain a positive unassigned surplus position and to continue to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group in future periods.

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. A control system, irrespective of how well it is designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance and cannot guarantee that it will succeed in its stated objectives. 
 Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the updated internal control framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) , management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 structured transactions for Radian Guaranty with million of aggregate remaining credit exposure as of December 31, 2022. 
 Radian Group and Radian Mortgage Assurance are parties to a guaranty agreement, which provides that Radian Group will make sufficient funds available to Radian Mortgage Assurance to ensure that Radian Mortgage Assurance has a minimum of million of statutory policyholders surplus every calendar quarter. Radian Mortgage Assurance had million of statutory policyholders surplus and RIF exposure as of December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Radian Group recorded a net deferred tax liability of million. This balance includes liabilities related to certain of our subsidiaries, which have incurred federal NOLs that could not be carried-back and utilized on a separate company tax return basis. As a result, we are not currently obligated under our tax-sharing agreement to reimburse these subsidiaries for their separate company federal NOL carryforward. However, if in a future period one of these subsidiaries utilizes its share of federal NOL carryforwards on a separate entity basis, then Radian Group may be obligated to fund such subsidiary s share of our consolidated tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service. 
 Note B 
 The Parent Company provides certain services to its subsidiaries. The Parent Company allocates to its subsidiaries expenses it incurs in the capacity of supporting those subsidiaries, including operating expenses, which are allocated based on the forecasted annual percentage of total revenue, which approximates the estimated percentage of time spent on certain subsidiaries, and interest expense, which is allocated based on relative capital. These expenses are presented net of allocations in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Substantially all operating expenses and interest expense have been allocated to the subsidiaries for 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Amounts allocated to the subsidiaries for expenses are based on actual cost, without any mark-up. The Parent Company considers these charges to be fair and reasonable. The subsidiaries generally reimburse the Parent Company for these costs in a timely manner, which has the impact of temporarily improving the cash flows of the Parent Company, if accrued expenses are reimbursed prior to actual payment. 
 Allocated interest expense Total allocated expenses 
 Note C 
 During 2022 and 2021, certain non-insurance subsidiaries had not generated sufficient cash flow to reimburse the Parent Company for its share of its direct and allocated operating expenses, and therefore the Parent Company effectively contributed a total of million and million, respectively, to these subsidiaries to reflect the impairment of the intercompany receivables representing unreimbursed direct and allocated costs.

Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C. 1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law. 
 10. Taxes . All payments under this Agreement shall be subject to applicable tax withholding. 
 11. Reduction of Payment Amount . 
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the Payments ), would constitute an excess parachute payment within the meaning of section 280G of the Code, the Company shall reduce (but not below zero) the aggregate present value of the Payments under the Agreement to the Reduced Amount (as defined below), 
 5 
 DB1 135647150.1 

if reducing the Payments under this Agreement will provide the Executive with a greater net after-tax amount than would be the case if no reduction was made. The Payments shall be reduced as described in the preceding sentence only if (i) the net amount of the Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and payroll taxes on the reduced Payments), is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of the Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and payroll taxes on the Payments and the amount of Excise Tax (as defined below) to which the Executive would be subject with respect to the unreduced Payments). Only amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this subsection (a). The Reduced Amount shall be an amount expressed in present value that maximizes the aggregate present value of Payments under this Agreement without causing any Payment under this Agreement to be subject to the Excise Tax, determined in accordance with section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. The term Excise Tax means the excise tax imposed under section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax. 
 (b) All determinations to be made under this Section 11 shall be made by an independent registered public accounting firm or consulting firm selected by the Company immediately prior to a change in control, which shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within ten (10) days of the change in control. Any such determination by such firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. All of the fees and expenses of the accounting or consulting firm in performing the determinations referred to in this Section shall be borne solely by the Company. 
 12. Death . In the event the Executive dies after a Qualifying Termination occurs, (a) any payments due to the Executive under this Agreement and not paid prior to the Executive s death shall be made to the personal representative of the Executive s estate and (b) the Executive s spouse and dependents then covered under the health plan described in Section 4(b)(iii) shall be eligible for continued coverage in accordance with Section 4(b)(iii). 
 13. Successors . All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, except that the duties and responsibilities of the Executive hereunder shall not be assignable in whole or in part by the Executive or the Company. The Company shall require any successor or successors (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, to acknowledge expressly that this Agreement is binding upon and enforceable against the Company in accordance with the terms hereof, and to become jointly and severally obligated with the Company to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or successions had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or successors to its business or assets, jointly and severally. 
 14. Notice . All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder or necessary or convenient herewith shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight express courier service, or by electronic delivery, delivery receipt requested, as follows

 23. Section 409A . 
 (a) The Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder or an exemption from section 409A, and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with section 409A.

All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.

The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten (10) days after the end of the six-month period. If the Executive dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of the postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of section 409A, shall be paid to the personal representative of the Executive s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of his death.

 DB1 121198294.3 

(b) Retirement . 
 (i) If the Grantee terminates employment during the Restriction Period because of the Grantee s Retirement, the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units will automatically vest in full on the date of such termination of employment. 
 (ii) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Retirement shall mean the Grantee s separation from service without Cause, other than on account of death or Disability (as defined below), (A) following the Grantee s attainment of age 65 and completion of five years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary, or (B) following the Grantee s attainment of age 55 and completion of 10 years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary. 
 (iii) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Cause shall mean the Grantee s (A) indictment for, conviction of, or pleading nolo contendere to, a felony or a crime involving fraud, misrepresentation, or moral turpitude (excluding traffic offenses other than traffic offenses involving the use of alcohol or illegal substances), (B) fraud, dishonesty, theft, or misappropriation of funds in connection with the Grantee s duties with the Company and its Subsidiaries, (C) material violation of the Company s Code of Conduct or employment policies, as in effect from time to time, (D) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Grantee s duties with the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (E) a breach of any written confidentiality, nonsolicitation, or noncompetition covenant with the Company or an Affiliate, in each case as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event that the Committee determines that the Grantee engaged in any of the foregoing activities that are grounds for termination for Cause at any time, the Committee may determine that the Grantee s termination of employment was a termination for Cause, even if not so designated at the date of termination. 
 (c) Involuntary Termination . 
 (i) Except as set forth in Section 2(e) below, if the Grantee terminates employment on or before the first Vesting Date because of an Involuntary Termination, one-third of the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units will automatically vest on the date of such termination of employment and the remaining unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited. If the Grantee terminates employment during the Restriction Period and after the first Vesting Date because of an Involuntary Termination, the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units will automatically vest in full on the date of such termination of employment. 
 (ii) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the term Involuntary Termination shall mean the Grantee s separation from service from the Company and its Subsidiaries on account of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause, other than on account of Retirement, death or Disability provided the Grantee signs and does not revoke a release and waiver of claims in favor of the Company and its Affiliates in a form provided by the Company or Subsidiary, as applicable. A termination by the Grantee for Good Reason under the Grantee s executive severance agreement shall be deemed to be an Involuntary Termination.

 (d) Death or Disability . In the event of the Grantee s death or Disability while employed by the Company or a Subsidiary during the Restriction Period, the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units will automatically vest in full on the date of the Grantee s death or Disability, as applicable.

of the Code, provided that the Grantee completes 30 days of active service with the Company at any time after the Grant Date and prior to the first Vesting Date. The date of Disability for purposes of these Terms and Conditions is the date on which the Grantee commences to receive such long-term disability benefits. In the event that the Grantee is not in active service on the Grant Date (for example, on account of short-term disability) and the Grantee does not return to the Company and complete 30 days of active service with the Company prior to the first Vesting Date, the award will be forfeited. 
 (e) Change of Control . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the Restriction Period, a Change of Control occurs and the Grantee s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause, or the Grantee terminates employment for Good Reason, and the Grantee s date of termination of employment (or in the event of the Grantee s termination for Good Reason, the event giving rise to Good Reason) occurs during the period beginning on the date that is 90 days before the Change of Control and ending on the date that is one year following the Change of Control, the unvested Restricted Stock Units will automatically vest as of the Grantee s date of termination of employment (or, if later, on the date of the Change of Control). 
 (f) Other Termination . Except as provided in Sections 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e), in the event of a termination of employment, the Grantee will forfeit all Restricted Stock Units that do not vest either before the termination date or on the termination date associated with such termination. Except as provided in Section 2(e), no Restricted Stock Units will vest after the Grantee s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary has terminated for any reason. For clarification purposes, in the event the Grantee s employment is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause, the outstanding Restricted Stock Units held by such Grantee shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect. 
 3. Restricted Stock Units Account . 
 The Company shall establish a bookkeeping account on its records for the Grantee and shall credit the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units to the bookkeeping account. 
 4. Dividend Equivalents. 
 Dividend equivalents shall accrue with respect to the Grantee s Restricted Stock Units and shall be payable subject to the same vesting terms and other conditions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate. Dividend equivalents shall be credited on the Restricted Stock Units when dividends are declared on shares of Common Stock from the Grant Date until the payment date for the vested Restricted Stock Units. The Company will keep records of dividend equivalents in a non-interest bearing bookkeeping account for the Grantee. No interest will be credited to any such account. Vested dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash at the same time and subject to the same terms as the underlying vested Restricted Stock Units. If and to the extent that the underlying Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, all related dividend equivalents shall also be forfeited. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Grantee elects to defer payment of the Restricted Stock Units under a Company deferred compensation plan, the payment date for accrued dividend equivalents will be determined based on the terms of the applicable deferred compensation plan. 
 5. Conversion of Restricted Stock Units. 
 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5, if the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with Section 2(a), the Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units within 90 days after the applicable Vesting Date. 
 3 
 DB1 121198294.3

 (i) If the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with Section 2(b) (Retirement), Section 2(c) (Involuntary Termination), or Section 2(d) (death or Disability), the Grantee shall receive payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units within 90 days after the date of the Grantee s termination of employment on account of Retirement, Involuntary Termination or death, or the date of Disability, as applicable. 
 (ii) If a Change of Control occurs and the Grantee s employment terminates in accordance with Section 2(e), the Grantee shall receive payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units within 90 days after the date of the Grantee s termination of employment (or, if later, on the date of the Change of Control). 
 (c) On the applicable payment date, each vested Restricted Stock Unit credited to the Grantee s account shall be settled in whole shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the number of vested Restricted Stock Units, subject to compliance with the six-month delay described in Section 17 below, if applicable, and the payment of any federal, state, local, or foreign withholding taxes as described in Section 13 below, and subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in Section 7 below. The obligation of the Company to distribute shares shall be subject to the rights of the Company as set forth in the Plan and to all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the Committee, including as set forth in Section 15 below. 
 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Grantee elects to defer payment of the Restricted Stock Units under the Company s applicable deferred compensation plan, payment shall be made in the form and at the time specified under such plan. 
 6. Certain Corporate Changes. 
 If any change is made to the Common Stock (whether by reason of merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or exchange of shares or any other change in capital structure made without receipt of consideration), then unless such event or change results in the termination of all the Restricted Stock Units granted under these Terms and Conditions, the Committee shall adjust, as provided in the Plan, the number and class of shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units held by the Grantee to reflect the effect of such event or change in the Company s capital structure in such a way as to preserve the value of the Restricted Stock Units. Any adjustment that occurs under the terms of this Section 6 or the Plan will not change the timing or form of payment with respect to any Restricted Stock Units except in accordance with section 409A of the Code. 
 7. Restrictive Covenants. 
 (a) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that, during and after the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates, the Grantee will be subject to, and will comply with, the applicable confidentiality and other terms specified in the Company s Code of Conduct and Ethics, including terms applicable to former employees. A copy of the Code of Conduct and Ethics has been provided to the Grantee and can be accessed on the Company s intranet. The Code of Conduct and Ethics, including any future revisions to the Code of Conduct and Ethics, are incorporated into and made a part of these Terms and Conditions as if fully set forth herein.

 DB1 121198294.3 

(b) The Grantee acknowledges that the Grantee s relationship with the Company and its Affiliates is one of confidence and trust such that the Grantee is, and may in the future be, privy to and or the Grantee will develop Confidential Information and Trade Secrets of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Subject to the provisions of subsection (j), the Grantee agrees that, at all times during the Grantee s employment and after the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates terminates for any reason, whether by the Grantee or by the Company or any of its Affiliates, the Grantee will hold in strictest confidence and will not disclose, use, or publish any Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, except as and only to the extent such disclosure, use, or publication is required during the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates for the Grantee to fulfill the Grantee s job duties and responsibilities to the Company or any of its Affiliates. At all times during the Grantee s employment and after the Grantee s termination of employment, the Grantee agrees that the Grantee shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent the inadvertent or accidental disclosure of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets. The Grantee hereby assigns to the Company any rights the Grantee may have or acquire in Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, whether developed by the Grantee or others, and the Grantee acknowledges and agrees that all Confidential Information and Trade Secrets shall be the sole property of the Company and its assigns. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Confidential Information and Trade Secrets shall mean information that the Company or any of its Affiliates owns or possesses, that the Company or any of its Affiliates have developed at significant expense and effort, that they use or that is potentially useful in the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates, that the Company or any of its Affiliates treat as proprietary, private, or confidential, and that is not generally known to the public. 
 (c) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that, during the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates, and for the 12 month period immediately following the Grantee s termination of employment for any reason, and subject to subsection (l) below (the Restricted Period ), the Grantee will not, without the Company s express written consent, engage (directly or indirectly) in any employment or business activity within the United States whose primary business involves or is related to providing any mortgage- or real estate-related service or product that, during the Grantee s employment, the Company or any of its Affiliates provides or is actively engaged in developing through the use of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets provided however, the foregoing restriction shall only apply to such service or product for which the Grantee has had access to Confidential Information and Trade Secrets or otherwise has had active involvement. The Grantee further agrees that, given the nature of the business of the Company and its Affiliates and the Grantee s position with the Company, a nationwide geographic scope is appropriate and reasonable. 
 (d) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that, during the term of the Grantee s employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates and during the Restricted Period, the Grantee shall not, directly or indirectly through others, (i) hire or attempt to hire any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii) solicit or attempt to solicit any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates to become an employee, consultant, or independent contractor to, for, or of any other person or business entity, or (iii) solicit or attempt to solicit any employee, or any consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Affiliates to change or terminate his or her relationship with the Company or any of its Affiliates, unless in each case more than six months shall have elapsed between the last day of such person s employment or service with the Company or any of its Affiliates and the first date of such solicitation or hiring or attempt to solicit or hire. If any employee, consultant, or independent contractor is hired or solicited by any entity that has hired or agreed to hire the Grantee, such hiring or solicitation shall be conclusively presumed to be a violation of these Terms and Conditions provided, however, that any hiring or solicitation pursuant to a general solicitation conducted by an entity 
 5 
 DB1 121198294.3 

that has hired or agreed to hire the Grantee, or by a headhunter employed by such entity, which does not involve the Grantee, shall not be a violation of this subsection (d). 
 (e) The Grantee covenants and agrees that, during the term of the Grantee s employment by the Company or any of its Affiliates and during the Restricted Period, the Grantee shall not, either directly or indirectly through others 
 (i) solicit, divert, appropriate, or do business with, or attempt to solicit, divert, appropriate, or do business with, any customer for whom the Company or any of its Affiliates provided goods or services within 12 months prior to the Grantee s date of termination or any actively sought prospective customer of the Company or any of its Affiliates for the purpose of providing such customer or actively sought prospective customer with services or products competitive with those offered by the Company or any of its Affiliates during the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates or 
 (ii) encourage any customer for whom the Company or any of its Affiliates provided goods or services within 12 months prior to the Grantee s date of termination to reduce the level or amount of business such customer conducts with the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
 (f) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the business of the Company and its Affiliates is highly competitive, that the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets have been developed by the Company or any of its Affiliates at significant expense and effort, and that the restrictions contained in this Section 7 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
 (g) The parties to these Terms and Conditions acknowledge and agree that any breach by the Grantee of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Section 7 will result in irreparable injury to the Company or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, for which money damages could not adequately compensate such entity. Therefore, the Company or any of its Affiliates shall have the right (in addition to any other rights and remedies which it may have at law or in equity and in addition to the forfeiture requirements set forth in subsection (h) below) to seek to enforce this Section 7 and any of its provisions by injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, without bond and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company or any of its Affiliates may have for a breach, or threatened breach, of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 7. The Grantee agrees that in any action in which the Company or any of its Affiliates seeks injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, the Grantee will not assert or contend that any of the provisions of this Section 7 are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable. The Grantee irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that any legal proceeding arising out of these Terms and Conditions shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in New Castle County, Delaware, (ii) consents to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court in any such proceeding, and (iii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in any such court. The Grantee also irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of any process, pleadings, notices, or other papers. 
 (h) The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that in the event the Grantee breaches any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Section 7 or the Grantee s employment is terminated by the Company or an Affiliate for Cause, including a determination by the Committee that the Grantee has engaged in any activity, at any time, that would be grounds for termination of the Grantee s employment for Cause 
 6 
 DB1 121198294.3 

(i) The Committee may in its discretion determine that the Grantee shall forfeit the outstanding Restricted Stock Units (without regard to whether the Restricted Stock Units have vested, except as to the vested shares where forfeiture of vested shares is expressly prohibited by law), and the outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall immediately terminate, and 
 (ii) The Committee may in its discretion require the Grantee to return to the Company any shares of Common Stock received in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units provided, that if the Grantee has disposed of any shares of Common Stock received upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, then the Committee may require the Grantee to pay to the Company, in cash, the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock as of the date of disposition. The Committee shall exercise the right of recoupment provided in this subsection (h)(ii) within (x) 180 days after the Committee s discovery of the Grantee s breach of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Section 7, or (y) within 180 days after the later of (A) the Grantee s termination of employment by the Company or an Affiliate for Cause, or (B) the Committee s discovery of circumstances that, if known to the Committee, would have been grounds for termination for Cause provided, however, that this right of recoupment shall not limit the Board s recoupment authority under any applicable clawback or recoupment policy of the Board. 
 (i) If any portion of the covenants or agreements contained in this Section 7, the specific forfeiture provisions related to vested shares, or the application thereof, is construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the other portions of such covenants or agreements or the application thereof shall not be affected and shall be given full force and effect without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions to the fullest extent possible. If any covenant or agreement in this Section 7 is held to be unenforceable because of the duration thereof or the scope thereof, then the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and limit the scope thereof, and the covenant or agreement shall then be enforceable in its reduced form. The covenants and agreements contained in this Section 7 shall survive the termination of the Grantee s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates and shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions. 
 (j) Nothing in these Terms and Conditions, including any restrictions on the use of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, shall prohibit or restrict the Grantee from initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiry from, providing testimony before, providing confidential information to, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, or filing a claim or assisting with an investigation directly with a self-regulatory organization or a government agency or entity, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress, any agency Inspector General or any other federal, state or local regulatory authority, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation. Nor do these Terms and Conditions require the Grantee to obtain prior authorization from the Company before engaging in any conduct described in this subsection (j), or to notify the Company that the Grantee has engaged in any such conduct. To the extent permitted by law and except as provided above in this subsection (j), upon receipt of any subpoena, court order, or other legal process compelling the disclosure of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, the Grantee agrees to give prompt written notice to the Company so as to permit the Company to protect its interests in confidentiality to the fullest extent possible. Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C. 1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law. 
 7 
 DB1 121198294.3 

(k) Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed to constitute the grant of any license or other right to the Grantee in respect of any Confidential Information and Trade Secrets or other data, tangible property, or intellectual property of the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
 (l) Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Grantee violate any of the restrictive covenants of these Terms and Conditions, then the period of the Grantee s breach of such covenant Violation Period shall stop the running of the corresponding Restricted Period. Once the Grantee resumes compliance with the restrictive covenant, the Restricted Period applicable to such covenant shall be extended for a period equal to the Violation Period so that the Company enjoys the full benefit of the Grantee s compliance with the restrictive covenant for the duration of the corresponding Restricted Period. 
 (m) In the event of a conflict between the terms of the confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation covenants in this Section 7 and a confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation covenant in a prior stock option, restricted stock unit or other equity grant agreement between the Grantee and the Company, the confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in this Section 7 shall control as of the Grant Date. 
 8. No Stockholder Rights. 
 The Grantee has no voting rights and no other ownership rights and privileges of a stockholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units, except as otherwise provided in Section 4. 
 9. Retention Rights. 
 Neither the award of Restricted Stock Units, nor any other action taken with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, shall confer upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or a Subsidiary or shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate Grantee s employment or service at any time. 
 10. Cancellation or Amendment. 
 This award may be canceled or amended by the Committee, in whole or in part, in accordance with the applicable terms of the Plan.

 These Terms and Conditions are made pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and shall in all respects be interpreted in accordance therewith. The decisions of the Committee shall be conclusive upon any question arising hereunder.

 13. Income Taxes Withholding Taxes. 
 The Grantee is solely responsible for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may arise in connection with the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.

 14. Governing Law. 
 The validity, construction, interpretation, and effect of this instrument shall exclusively be governed by, and determined in accordance with, the applicable laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle.

Notwithstanding anything in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the Plan, these Terms and Conditions, and the Restricted Stock Units awarded hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, including any laws, regulations, restrictions, or governmental guidance that becomes applicable in the event of the Company s participation in any governmental programs, and the Committee reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions and the Restricted Stock Units as necessary to conform to any restrictions imposed by any such laws, regulations, restrictions, or governmental guidance or to conform to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies, and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time. As a condition of participating in the Plan, and by the Grantee s acceptance of the Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee is deemed to have agreed to any such modifications that may be imposed by the Committee, and agrees to sign such waivers or acknowledgments as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate with respect to such modifications.

 DB1 121198294.3 

16. Assignment. 
 These Terms and Conditions shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors and assignees of the Company. The Grantee may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock Units, except to a Successor Grantee in the event of the Grantee s death. 
 17. Section 409A. 
 This award of Restricted Stock Units is intended to be exempt from or comply with the applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code and shall be administered in accordance with section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, if the Restricted Stock Units constitute deferred compensation under section 409A of the Code and the Restricted Stock Units become vested and settled upon the Grantee s termination of employment, payment with respect to the Restricted Stock Units shall be delayed for a period of six months after the Grantee s termination of employment if the Grantee is a specified employee as defined under section 409A of the Code (as determined by the Committee), if required pursuant to section 409A of the Code. If payment is delayed, the shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be distributed within 30 days of the date that is the six-month anniversary of the Grantee s termination of employment. If the Grantee dies during the six-month delay, the shares shall be distributed in accordance with the Grantee s will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, payments made with respect to this award of Restricted Stock Units may only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted by section 409A of the Code, and all payments to be made upon a termination of employment hereunder may only be made upon a separation from service as defined under section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of these Terms and Conditions would cause a conflict with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the Restricted Stock Units to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. In no event shall the Grantee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. If the Restricted Stock Units constitute deferred compensation under section 409A of the Code and payment is subject to the execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and its Affiliates, and if payment with respect to the Restricted Stock Units that is subject to the execution of the release could be made in more than one taxable year, payment shall be made in the later taxable year.
