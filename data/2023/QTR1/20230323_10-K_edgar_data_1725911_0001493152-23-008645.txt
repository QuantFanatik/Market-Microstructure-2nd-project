Business 

We
are an early-stage diversified holdings company which sells multiple products under common management with one of them
a global multi-line consumer packaged goods CPG company with branded product lines in the food and snack industry. This
division operates as marketer and distributor in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Another division is focused and involved in building
and acquiring ecommerce assets as well as private businesses in various verticals with the goal of scaling them up and increasing
revenue. Historically, the large majority of our sales have been through traditional brick-and-mortar methods. However, going forward,
we intend to focus on growing our e-commerce business as well as maintaining the core business which in large part exists in brick and
mortar.

Packaged
Goods 

The
Company is focused on developing and marketing products that appeal to consumers growing preference in the snack foods category.
The Company is taking a major shift towards ecommerce development and acquisition of new ecommerce assets to diversify its business with
an approximate 90/10 focus on ecommerce sales while still growing brick and mortar sales. As the Company identifies products that fit
within its distribution channels, it will seek to enter into non-exclusive manufacturing and licensing agreements with such factories
to manufacture products under the Company s own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and/or global markets. Currently,
the Company maintains six trademarks for its brands registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Each trademark covers numerous
product lines with a variety of unique identifiers (known as SKUs) offered under the applicable brand name. The Company has non-contractual
on-going relationships with a few Fortune 500 companies, including club and retail chain stores to whom the Company directly sells its
products. 

The
Company sells its food and snack products directly in the United States and global markets through various distribution channels comprising
specialty, grocery retailers, food-service distributors and direct store delivery DSD ), as well as the vending, pantry,
and the micro-market segment. Our buyers typically represent recognized large retail chain stores. The products are then distributed
by the chains to their local outlets. The Company seeks out and develops snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based
on market trends and input from the buyers as to consumer demand. The Company works closely with buyers to evaluate products with the
intent to identify products that have likely customer demand. We recently re-branded and launched all new snack marketplace and will
seek to gain market share in the ecommerce segment. Our re-branded website will serve as snack marketplace which will carry its own branded
products and other gourmet snacks and products. 

We
intend to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its trademarked brands and to expand the Company s offering
portfolio by identifying, producing, and marketing new products. Management believes that the strategy of acquiring small brands regional
brands and adding these to the Company s national distribution can prove beneficial for the Company. 

The
Company s management believes that the strategy of acquiring small brands regional distribution brands and acquiring more e-commerce
brand assets will diversify its current business and increase its business operation results. 

Vending
Operations 

In
addition to placing its products with large retail specialty chains, the Company supplies products to vending channels throughout the
United States through food service distributors. These vending machines are located in malls, service stations, and schools. The Company
works with vending companies that have, in the aggregate, more than 100,000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies vending companies
with products. The Company works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service distributors. The broker
pre-sells the products and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts, the distributor buys the
product directly. Vending machine sales represent approximately one percent our revenues. 

E-Commerce
Business 

On
August 31, 2022, the Company acquired from InPlay all of the assets relating to the online home fitness store known as The Hula
Fit, including the Shopify Store and the TikTok, Facebook and Google ad accounts. The Company intends to make additional acquisitions
of ecommerce businesses and assets in an attempt to grow its digital business.

Retail
Chain Buyers 

The
primary distribution of our products has been through specialty retail chains. We work with the buying office that determines placement
for our products. The retail chain will then distribute the products to its retail outlets. 

Our
Strategy and Strengths 

We
believe a variety of favorable consumer trends, including a greater focus on health and wellness, increased consumption of smaller, more
frequent meals throughout the day and a preference for convenient gourmet foods and snacks will continue to drive overall snacking growth
within the overall market. Our Management believes that the Company s products appeal to a wide range of consumers, including most
age brackets. The young snackers, classified as those being between the ages of 18-34, tend to consume more snacks than average adults
but the gourmet foods reach the broader adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods. We expect to explore
the development and acquisition of small regional brands and add them to the Company s national distribution within the United
States and globally. 

We
anticipate that our marketing strategy will use the internet and social media including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Our distribution
channels consist of retailers, distributors, online e-commerce, and vending companies. The Company s marketing strategy is primarily
targeted at vendors and retail chain stores. 

The
Company anticipates utilizing the following opportunities to further its marketing program, to obtain information to adjust and modify,
as needed, the marketing program, and to create direct interest in its products: 

Networking .
Networking could be a low-cost but often effective means for us to generate partnerships and growth while bolstering personal commitments
to the Company. Management will join wholesalers associations to network with other food manufacturers and distributors. 

Trade
Shows. The Company plans to attend trade shows and exhibitions related to the food manufacturing industry, such as SIAL, PLMA Amsterdam,
Thaifex, Fancy Food, CIBUS, ISM, and ANUGA among others. Through attendance at conventions and trade shows, management remains knowledgeable
and informed about advancements, trends, and issues of concern in the market. 

Direct
Sales. The Company plans to employ a dedicated sales team to enact precise sales and promotional efforts in the near future. 

6 

Social
Media and Food Blogging. The Company will manage its brands on social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Twitter
has proven an effective platform to conduct customer satisfaction surveys as well as solicit customer feedback on food products. 

The
rise in popularity of the food blogging community has given consumers a massive platform on which to share their opinion and make their
voices heard. This has led to a rise in consumer concerns about food, with increasing emphasis being placed on healthy eating and organic
produce. The Company will use food blogging websites to promote its products and highlight benefits that appeal to a new generation of
socially-aware consumers. 

Websites.
 A well-optimized website has been constructed, with proper site structure, page layout, and clear and easy navigation, along with
targeted keywords embedded throughout the site to ensure prominent search engine placement and saturation. The Company s websites
are important marketing assets: 

www.360worldsnacks.com, 

 www.biscottelli.com, 

 www.gdmginc.com, 

 www.dolcibono.com, 

 www.fruttatasnacks.com,

www.ezlyv.com

We
anticipate that we will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is Young Snackers that
are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong with millennials
and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials, age 23 to 40, reported eating four or more times a day, compared to just 10 
of Gen X and 9 of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a strong snack market. 

The
Company use of co-packers for manufacturing and packaging of its products provides the most efficient and cost-effective means of operations
for a small company like we are. It allows us to scale-up and meet growing demand, without having to invest in our own industrial setting
and without the high overhead costs of hiring salespeople as employees of the Company. The Company intends to employ this model strategy
in the future and also to attract and retain experienced sales team. 

Competition 

The
snack food industry in the United States is very competitive, particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. In the United States,
a study conducted and published by the Packaging Strategies magazine reported that snacks account for 51 of all food sales, and 92 
of adults in the US have snacked within the last 24 hours. 

The
Company has observed an increased demand for healthy snacks. In the United States, companies are finding success in the
 snackable fruit and vegetable category, such as grapes or baby carrots. 

A
challenge facing entrants in the snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers, particularly the industry
leader PepsiCo. Large producers may experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and typically possess sufficient capital to
invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore, companies such as PepsiCo often benefit
from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators, enabling them to lower their product prices and to engage
in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers may also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale
and scope 

Employees 

The
Company currently has four employees, including one executive officer, a director of operations, a warehouse manager and a staff employee. 

Subsidiaries 

Global
Diversified Holdings, Inc., is the Company s only subsidiary.

 Risk
 Factors 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described
below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
In addition, we may face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or which as of the date of this registration statement
we might not consider significant, which may adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case the trading price of our common stock could
decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and you may lose part or all of your investment. 

Risks
Related to our Business and Industry. 

The
Company depends on its President and Chief Financial Officer who is the same individual, to manage its business effectively and loss of the President and
Chief Financial Officer could significantly impair the Company s results. 

The
Company, through its subsidiary, has a developed track record of bringing successful new products to the retail chain buyers for the
placement and sale of the Company s products. This track record has been developed by the President and Chief Financial Officer
of the Company, Paul Adler, and his ability to locate and produce unique and quality snack and gourmet foods attractive to the buyer s
market. The loss of Mr. Adler as the Company s President and Chief Financial Officer, or in active management of the Company, could
have a significant negative impact of the operations of the Company. Such a loss could impact the production of current product, the
relationship with the retail chain stores and development of future products. 

Our
management have expressed their concern as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

On
a consolidated basis, the Company has incurred significant operating losses since inception and has a working capital deficit and accrued
liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash on hand of 54,185 and an accumulated deficit of 28,630,321. The consolidated
financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company s existing operational cash flow may not be sufficient to fund
presently anticipated operations, and the Company will need to raise additional funds through alternative sources of financing. There
is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when it is needed, or that such funding, if available, will be obtainable
on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be forced to reduce or cease our activities with consequent loss
to investors. In addition, should we incur significant presently unforeseen expenses or delays, we may not be able to accomplish our
goals. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the
Company is unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially
and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
gourmet and snack food markets are dominated by several large strong food producers. 

A
challenge facing potential new or expanding entrants in the market is the dominance of leading snack food producers, particularly industry
leader PepsiCo. Large producers experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and possess sufficient capital to invest in extensive
advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore, companies such as PepsiCo benefit from higher profit margins
when compared with small- to medium-sized operators, enabling them to lower their product prices to engage in price-based competition
with competitors. Multinational producers also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale and scope. Although these factors
do not prevent a prospect from entering the industry, they may hamper the success of new entrants. 

In
addition, many industry players have established relationships with downstream retailers, which may be difficult for new entrants to
secure. Typically, supermarkets give companies with established brands the most optimal shelf space. Moreover, larger producers have
established relationships with upstream suppliers, an advantage that new entrants may find difficult to replicate.

During
the last two fiscal years the Company has had four to five major customers that accounted for between 92.6 - 99 of its sales. 

Historically,
the Company has relied on a small number of customers to generate a large portion of its revenue. In 2022, five customers accounted for
approximately 92.6 of the Company s revenues. In 2021, five customers accounted for approximately 99 of the Company s revenues.
Loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity. Although we believe that
we could locate replacement customers, the initial loss of such revenues could hamper on going production and distribution of the Company. 

No
assurance of commercial success of any additional products. 

The
Company intends to seek and produce new products to add to its trademarked brands and to offer its buyers. The Company may spend a large
portion of its revenues in locating and producing such products and the possible inability to market such products to the retail chain
buyers, or the failure of such products to sell successfully once marketed could significantly impact the operations of the Company and
impact its future ability to market other new products. 

Failure
to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
results. 

Failure
to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
results. To manage our growth effectively, we must continually evaluate and evolve our business and manage our employees, operations,
finances, technology and development, and capital investments efficiently. Our efficiency, productivity and the quality of our business
may be adversely impacted if we fail to appropriately coordinate across our business operations. Additionally, rapid growth may place
a strain on our resources, infrastructure, and ability to maintain the quality of our production. If and when our structure becomes more
complex as we add additional staff, we will need to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting
systems and procedures. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating revenues. 

As
a food production company, all of our products must be compliant with regulations by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Any non-compliance
with the FDA could harm our business. 

We
must comply with various FDA rules and regulations, including those regarding product manufacturing, food safety, required testing and
appropriate labeling of our products. While our products are compliance with current regulations by the FDA, it is possible that regulations
by the FDA and its interpretation thereof may change over time. As such, there is a risk that our products could become non-compliant
with the FDA s regulations and any such non-compliance could harm our business. 

Our
intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business. 

We
regard our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property
with registered and common law trademarks, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement. However, there can be
no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. If we lose some
or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected. 

We
may be subject to claims alleging the intellectual property subject to our licensing agreements is violating the intellectual property
rights of others. 

We
may face significant expense and liability as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights of
others. We could be required to participate in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another
entity. The cost to us of any such proceeding could be substantial. An adverse outcome in an interference proceeding could require us
to cease using the technology, substantially modify it or to license rights from prevailing third parties. There is no guarantee that
any prevailing owner of intellectual property would offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in our activities, or that
such a license is made available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, third parties may, in the future,
assert other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our services, technologies or other matters. 

9 

We
may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical
harm. 

We
sell products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration,
mislabeling and misbranding. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to, or may voluntarily, recall or withdraw products. Such
withdrawal may negatively and significantly impact our sales and profitability for a period of time and could result in significant losses
depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction and customer and
consumer reaction. We may also be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting in liability for actual or claimed injuries, illness or death.
Any of these events may result in a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a product liability claim or lawsuit is unsuccessful
or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely
affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, certain claims
or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against
others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount that is required by our customers/retailers. However, we cannot be sure
that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product
liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. 

Limitations
on director and officer liability and indemnification of our officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders from bringing suit
against a director. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law, that a director or officer
shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions. 

Risks
Related to COVID-19 

The
uncertainty and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an adverse effect on our operations and on the global capital markets. 

The
current outbreak of COVID-19 could continue to have a material and adverse effect on the Company s business operations. We sell
our products throughout the United States and global markets to buyers which typically represent recognized large retail chain stores.
Any disruptions or restrictions on the Company s ability to travel or to distribute its products in the United States and in global
markets, as well as temporary closures of production facilities would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, Covid-19
has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many other countries, resulting
in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results. 

The
extent to which our results continue to be affected by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments which cannot be
accurately predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental and business responses to the pandemic and the
impact on the global economy, demand for our products, and our ability to provide our products, particularly as a result of our
employees working remotely and/or the closure of certain offices and production facilities. While these factors are uncertain, the
COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

The
Company s sole officer beneficially owns and will continue to own a majority of the Company s common stock and, as a result,
can exercise control over shareholder and corporate actions. 

Paul
Adler, the founder and President of the Company, is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 79.1 of the Company s outstanding
Common Stock, In addition, Mr. Adler owns 1,000 shares of Series A Super Voting Preferred Stock as such, he will have approximately 97.2 
of the voting power in the Company and thus be able to control all matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election
of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. 

10 

The
Company has authorized the issuance of preferred stock with certain preferences. 

The
Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of 0.0001 par value preferred stock. The board of directors of the Company (the
 Board has the power to establish the dividend rates, liquidation preferences, and voting rights of any series of preferred
stock, and these rights may be superior to the rights of holders of the Shares. The Board may also establish redemption and conversion
terms and privileges with respect to any shares of preferred stock. Any such preferences may operate to the detriment of the rights of
the holders of the Shares, and further, could be used by the Board as a device to prevent a change in control of the Company. To the
Company has designated 1,000,000 shares of Series A Super Voting Preferred Stock, each of which votes with the Common Stock and has 100,000
votes. Mr. Adler, our sole officer and a member of the Board, owns all the issued 1,000 shares of this class of preferred stock which
gives him an additional 100,000,000 voting rights in any shareholder meeting. 

Future
capital raises may dilute our existing shareholders ownership, the value of their equity securities and/or have other adverse
effects on our operations. 

If
we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in connection with equity financings, our existing shareholder percentage
ownership may decrease, and these shareholders may experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt instruments,
these debt instruments could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional
funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products,
or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or could diminish the rights of our shareholders. Furthermore, if we offer
to sell our shares of Common Stock in subsequent offerings for the purchase price that is less than the purchase price of shares of Common
Stock offered pursuant to this Report, this may impact the value of equity securities of the shareholders that are purchasing our shares
of Common Stock in the offering pursuant to this Report. In addition, the issuance of such additional shares may impact the ability of
any investor to sell their shares once such shares are eligible for sale. 

The
Company s election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily
comparable to other companies. 

Pursuant
to the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised
accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period
which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company,
as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company s financial
statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted
out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used. 

Penny
Stock rules may make buying or selling our Common Stock difficult. Limitations upon Broker-Dealers Effecting Transactions in Penny
Stocks 

Trading
in our Common Stock is subject to material limitations as a consequence of regulations which limit the activities of broker-dealers effecting
transactions in penny stocks. Pursuant to Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, our Common Stock is a penny stock 
because it (i) is not listed on any national securities exchange (ii) has a market price of less than 5.00 per share, and (iii) its
issuer (the Company) has net tangible assets less than 2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in business for at least three (3) years) or
 5,000,000 (if the issuer has been in business for less than three (3) years). 

Rule
15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act imposes limitations upon trading activities on penny stocks , which makes selling
our Common Stock more difficult compared to selling securities which are not penny stocks. Rule 15a-9 restricts the solicitation
of sales of penny stocks by broker-dealers unless the broker first (i) obtains from the purchaser information concerning
his financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives, (ii) reasonably determines that the purchaser has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial matters that the person is capable of evaluating the risks of investing in penny stocks ,
and (iii) delivers and receives back from the purchaser a manually signed written statement acknowledging the purchaser s investment
experience and financial sophistication. 

11 

Rules
15g-2 through 15g-6 promulgated under the Exchange Act require broker-dealers who engage in transactions in penny stocks 
first to provide their customers with a series of disclosures and documents, including (i) a standardized risk disclosure document identifying
the risks inherent in investing in penny stocks , (ii) all compensation received by the broker-dealer in connection with
the transaction, (iii) current quotation prices and other relevant market data, and (iv) monthly account statements reflecting the fair
market value of the securities. 

There
can be no assurance that any broker-dealer which initiates quotations for the Common Stock will continue to do so, and the loss of any
such broker-dealer likely would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described below, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment
to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to
recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain
information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least
some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock,
which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

Because
our Common Stock is deemed a low-priced penny stock, it will be cumbersome for brokers and dealers to trade in our Common
Stock, making the market for our Common Stock less liquid and negatively affect the price of our stock. 

We
will be subject to certain provisions of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny stock rules as defined in
Rule 3a51-1. A penny stock is generally defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. Since our stock is deemed to be a penny stock, trading is subject to additional sales practice requirements of
broker-dealers. These require a broker-dealer to: 

Deliver
 to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document; 

Disclose
 certain price information about the stock; 

Disclose
 the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer; 

Send
 monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and 

In
 some circumstances, approve the purchaser s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer
 with information specified in the rules. 

Consequently,
penny stock rules and FINRA rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in our
Common Stock. Also, prospective investors may not want to get involved with the additional administrative requirements, which may have
a material adverse effect on the trading of our shares. 

We
are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act of 2012 and a smaller reporting company and, as a result
of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, our Common
Stock may be less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company , as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including,
but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments
not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and
our stock price may be more volatile. 

12 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary
of the date of the completion of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue
of at least 1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0
million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0
billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.. 

Even
after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, 
which would allow us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including, among other
things, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, presenting only
the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in this Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

Our
status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need
it. 

Because
of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company and because we will
have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive to investors
and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with
other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry.
If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected . 

Since
we are traded on the OTC Pink Market, an active, liquid trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be sustained. If and when
an active market develops the price of our common stock may be volatile. 

Presently,
our Common Stock is traded on the OTC Pink Market. There is a very limited trading in our stock and there is no assurance that an active
market will develop. In the absence of an active trading market, investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market
quotations, market visibility for shares of our Common Stock may be limited, and a lack of visibility for shares of our Common Stock
may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock. The lack of an active market impairs your ability to
sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also
reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations
by selling shares. 

Trading
in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink Market is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that
may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The securities market has from time-to-time experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may
also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our Common stock. Moreover, the OTC Pink Market is not a stock exchange
and is not an established market, and trading of Securities is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national
stock exchange like the NYSE. Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any shares of Common Stock.

Comparison
of the Year Ended December 31, 2022 to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues
and Cost of Sales 

Sales
for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,643,138 compared to sales of 2,665,017 for the year ended December 31, 2021 a decrease
of 1,021,879, or a decrease of 38.3 . The decrease was primarily due to a one-time order from a major club store chain in the first
quarter of 2021 without a comparable order in 2022, shipping and logistic issues, transitioning from a public warehouse to our own warehousing
facility, and the significant loss of revenue on a product with eight SKUs that was produced in Russia that is no longer available to
us. 

Historically,
the Company has relied on a small number of customers to generate a large portion of its revenue. In 2022, five customers accounted for
approximately 92.3 of the Company s revenues. In 2021, five customers accounted for approximately 99.0 of the Company s
revenues. Loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse impact on the Company s profitability and liquidity. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, gross profit was 407,610, or 24.8 of revenue, compared to gross profit of 1,035,901 or 38.9 of
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit was attributable to lower sales volumes. The decrease in gross
profit margin was primarily due to significantly increased shipping and inventory costs. 

Operating
expenses 

Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 1,474,405 compared to 2,237,178 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating
expenses consisted of payroll and taxes, legal and professional fees, rent and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating
expenses included 227,361 and 1,121,592 in non-cash stock- based compensation for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Excluding this stock based compensation in both periods, operating expenses were 1,247,044 and 1,115,587, for periods ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively Excluding stock-based compensation in both periods the increase in operating expenses in 2022 compared
to 2021 is attributable to 50,000 in impairment of intangible assets in 2022 compared to zero in 2021, an increase in rent expense in
2022 due to the Company s new warehouse facility, an increase in 2022 payroll partially offset by a decrease in selling general
and administrative expenses in 2022. 

Other
(expense) 

Other
expense is comprised of interest expense. Other expense was 19,687 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 12,601 in other
expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other expense is attributable to higher levels of borrowing due to decreased
profitability. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 54,185 and 312,574 in cash on hand, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities
for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 436,645, compared to 438,415 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The slight decrease in
net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to a reduction of inventory levels offset by increased operating losses
excluding non-cash stock based compensation. 

Cash
flows from financing activities was 228,257 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 696,432 during the year ended December
31, 2021. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to proceeds from government loans of 379,165
and proceeds from private placements of 300,000 in 2021 compared to -0- for both categories in 2022, partially offset by increases
of notes payable in 2022 of 216,022 over 2021 levels. 

17 

A
large portion of the Company s liquidity in 2021 was provided by the SBA COVID-19 loans and EIDL loans thus allowing the Company
to reduce its reliance on factoring. Due to operating losses in 2022 the Company relied on new lines of credit to fund its operations.
There can be no assurances that additional lines or credit on reasonable terms, will be available to the Company in the future. Nor can
there be any assurance that the Company will achieve positive cash flow from operations. 

Seasonality 

The
Company s business is not subject to seasonality. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Going
Concern 

There
is substantial doubt about the Company continuing as a going concern based on the Company s accumulated deficit and accrued liabilities.
For the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of 1,086,662 and had a stockholder s deficit of 710,953. 

The
consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is in fact unable to continue as a going concern,
the shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.

 Controls
 and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of the end of the fiscal year under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer (who is also the principal financial officer).
There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent
to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the principal officer believes that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in gathering, analyzing, and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized, and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly
involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company. Management has determined that disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Rule 13a-15
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s sole officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, based
on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected. 

BF
Borgers CPA PC., Lakewood, Colorado, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, has not issued an attestation
report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as no such report is required for a smaller
reporting company. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Director
Independence 

With
the exception of Paul Adler, our Board has determined that all of our directors are independent, as that term is defined by NASDAQ Marketplace
Rule 5605(a)(2). In assessing the independence of the directors, the Board considers any transactions, relationships and arrangements
between our Company and our independent directors or their affiliated companies. This review is based primarily on responses of the directors
to questions in a director and officer questionnaire regarding employment, business, familial, compensation and other relationships with
our Company or our management. 

Term
of Office 

Our
directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until removed
from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our Board and hold office until removed by the Board. 

Committees
of the Board 

Audit
Committee 

The
Company established its Audit Committee on April 5, 2021. The Audit Committee will (a) assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight of:
(i) the quality and integrity of the Company s financial statements; (ii) the Company s compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements relating to the Company s financial statements and related disclosures; (iii) the qualifications and independence
of the Company s independent auditors; and (iv) the performance of the Company s independent auditors; and (b) prepares any
reports that the rules of the SEC require be included in the Company s annual proxy statement. We appointed our new director, David
Natan, as a member of the Audit Committee. Our Board may designate from among its members to appoint additional members to the Audit
Committee in the future. We have not adopted a written audit committee charter at this time. 

21 

Other
than the audit committee, the Company currently does not have any other committees, nor does the Company have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. The Board believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because they can adequately
perform the functions of such committees. However, the Board may establish such committees in the near future upon the Board s
determination. 

The
Company does not currently have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations
for directors. The Board believe that, given the stage of the Company s development, a specific nominating policy would be premature
and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. The Company does not currently have any specific
or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board and does not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election
or appointment. A shareholder who wishes to communicate with the Board may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President
and Director, at the address appearing on the first page of this filing. 

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships between any of our directors or executive officers. 

Certain
Legal Proceedings 

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors, or control persons which involved a criminal
conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one s participation in the securities or banking
industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. 

Oversight 

Effective
risk oversight is an important priority of the Company. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision, the Directors 
approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in the Company s business and strategy, evaluating the Company s
risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight among the full Board of Directors, and fostering an appropriate
culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives
to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business
conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. Prior
to the establishment of an audit committee, our Board was responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection
of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial statements and
other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. With the establishment of the audit committee, the audit
committee will perform this and other functions, assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. 

Code
of Ethics 

The
Company has not adopted a code of ethics. 

22 

Director
of Operations . 

Sergey
Kats. Sergey Kats has started his employment with the Company as the director of operations on April 5, 2021. Prior to joining the
Company as the director of operations, Mr. Kats has worked in major business banking institutions. From March 2019 to March 2021, Mr.
Kats served as Vice President Senior Bank Business Banker at Capital One Bank. From March 2012 to March 2019, he was employed with JP
Morgan Chase Bank, starting as a Business Banker and becoming a Vice President Business Relationship Manager. Mr. Kats received his Associate
Degree in Business Administration at Nassau Community College in May 2007. We do not have a written employment agreement with Mr. Kats,
but the Company made an oral arrangement to pay Sergey Kats an annual salary in the amount of 160,000 which was increased to 175,000
in 2022. In addition, the Company issued 100,000 shares of its Common Stock to Mr. Kats upon his employment as a sign on bonus. 

Advisors 

In
addition to the management team, the Company has developed an advisory team that supports the Company and provides guidance and credibility
and contacts as needed. The advisors do not receive compensation for their assistance to the Company. The advisors include: 

Anthony
Cascione. Anthony Cascione is a lifetime member of the vending industry and a partner in Group C. As the director of operations of
Route Drive and Manager and a specialist in operations and logistics, Mr. Cascione s deployment of cloud-based management and telemetry
systems have helped CC Vending become one of the East Coast s largest independent operators, with over 15,000 machines in a four-state
area. He has similarly expanded Group C s Micro Market facilities, which now operate throughout the region. Of particular note,
is the 10-year extension of the New York City Department of Education contract, which was credited to Mr. Cascione s management
of the account and his stewardship throughout the renewal process. At the present time, there are over 3,000 machines operating in 1,400
schools. Mr. Cascione is committed to the continued growth of Group C and its various companies. His knowledge of the industry and passion
for innovation, along with his leadership, has provided the structure and strategy to continue its expansion in both operations and geography.
Anthony Cascione is the son of Michael Cascione. 

Oleg
Kaplun. In 2010, Mr. Kaplun started a food distribution company in New York to service specialty and ethnic markets. He has continued
to grow his company by expanding the customer base and introducing products from all over the world. He has increased truck fleet by
6-fold and continues to seek new opportunities by branching out in other markets. Currently, the assortment of the products that his
company offers is up to 2500 SKU s. Before founding his distribution company, Mr. Kaplun ran a national distribution company in
Israel and was instrumental in building a multinational distribution network.

of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Diversified Marketing Group, Inc. (the Company as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 TO
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER

on , and changed its name on June 13, 2018, as part of a change in control. As part of the change in control,
its then officers and directors resigned and contributed back to the Company shares of the outstanding shares of
its common stock, and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14, 2018, the new management of the Company issued shares
of its common stock to Paul Adler, the then president of the Company. 

On
November 26, 2018, the Company effected the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings, Inc. GDHI ), a private New York
company owned by the Company s president, with the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for all
of the outstanding shares of GDHI. GDHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and its activity for the years 2022 and 2021
is reflected in these financial statements along with the expenses of the Company. 

Prior
to the acquisition of GDHI, the Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition, the Company acquired the operations
and business plan of GDHI, which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes, GDHI is considered to be the acquirer,
and the equity is presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2017. 

On
August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with InPlay Capital Inc., a Delaware corporation InPlay ),
pursuant to which, on the same date, the Company purchased from InPlay all of the assets used in the operation and conduct of its business
relating to the online home fitness store known as The Hula Fit , including the Shopify Store and the TikTok, Facebook and
Google ad accounts, for a purchase price of . Paul Adler, the sole executive officer and a director of the Company, and the Company s

The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this
core principle we apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the
contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues
when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Typically the Company receives a detailed purchase order from large retailers that specificy the goods ordered, their
price, payment terms and the required delivery date. Once the delivery of items on the purchase order is made to the client and title
passes, the Company has met its performance obligation and recognizes revenue. 

and during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Determining
the fair value of intangible assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. 

On
September 30, 2022 we conducted an impairment analysis and determined that our purchase of Hula fit was fully impaired. As a result we
record an impairment loss of for the year ended December 31, 2022.

and had an accumulated deficit of . These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financials have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is, in fact, unable to continue as a going concern, the shareholders may lose some or all
of their investment in the Company.

 THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

The
following summary describes the common stock of Global Diversified Marketing Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ),
which is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Only
the Company s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 

DESCRIPTION
OF COMMON STOCK 

The
following description of our common stock is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Incorporation,
as amended and our bylaws, and by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ). 

Authorized
Capitalization 

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ), and

Anti-Takeover
Provisions 

Certain
provisions of the DGCL our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from
attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the price of our common stock that
often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our
management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise
deem to be in their best interests. 

Delaware
Anti-Takeover Statute 

We
are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a person deemed an interested stockholder from engaging in a business
combination with a publicly held Delaware corporation for three years following the date such person becomes an interested stockholder
unless the business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed
manner or another prescribed exception applies. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates
and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of a corporation s
voting stock. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting
in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to
transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, such as discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium
over the price of our common stock. 

Special
Stockholder Meetings 

Our
bylaws provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called by two-thirds or more of the members of our board of directors, the
president, or any executive vice president and shall be called upon the written request of the holders of two-thirds or more of each
class or series of the capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting on the matters(s) that are the subject of the proposed
meeting. 

Requirements
for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals 

Our
bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors,
other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors.
