the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of effecting our initial business combination. 

While we may pursue an initial
business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we focus our search on targets operating in the technology-focused areas
including software, mobile and Internet of Things IoT applications, digital and energy transformation, cloud and cyber
communications as well as high bandwidth services, including LTE, remote sensing and 5G communications. 

Initial Public Offering 

On January 14, 2022, we consummated
our initial public offering of 17,250,000 units, including 2,250,000 additional units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters 
over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of one Class A common stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company,
with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for 11.50 per whole share. The units
were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 172,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 8,037,500 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price
of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 8,037,500. 

A total of 175,950,000, comprised
of 169,050,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and 6,900,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants
was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 

It is the job of our sponsor
and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Scott Crist, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, and R. Greg Smith, our Chief Financial Director and director, who have many years of experience in technology entrepreneurship,
venture capital, private equity, and investment banking. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we must complete
our initial business combination by April 14, 2023, 15 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If the Extension Amendment
Proposal (as defined below) is not approved and our initial business combination is not consummated by April 14, 2023, then our existence
will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate
our initial business combination by April 14, 2023, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period
of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination
until July 14, 2023), subject to the sponsor depositing into the trust account, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable
deadline, 1,725,000 0.10 per unit), for the available three month extension. Our public shareholders will not be afforded an opportunity
to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination from 15 months to 18 months described above or to redeem
their shares in connection with such extension. 

Extension Amendment Proposal 

Since our initial business
combination will not be consummated by April 14, 2023, we are holding a special meeting of stockholders on April 10, 2023, to vote on
a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we must complete an initial business
combination (the Extension from April 14, 2023 to December 14, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by the Company s
board of directors (the "Extension Amendment Proposal ). If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the board of directors
decides to implement the Extension, the sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us loans equal to the lesser of (x) 35,000
or (y) 0.035 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month (commencing on April 15, 2023 and ending on the 14th
day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the business combination until December 14,
2023. For more information, please see our proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on March 22, 2023. 

If the Extension Amendment
Proposal is not approved and we do not consummate an initial business combination by April 14, 2023, then our existence will terminate,
and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.

NEXT Business Combination 

General Terms and Effects; Merger Consideration 

On November 21, 2022, the
Company entered into the NEXT Merger Agreement with NEXT and Merger Sub. 

Pursuant to the NEXT Merger
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, following the closing (the Closing of the NEXT Business

Company, and with each stockholder of NEXT (collectively, the NEXT Securityholders receiving newly-issued Company securities,
including, as applicable, shares of our Class A common stock and/or options or warrants pursuant to which our Class A common stock will
be issued, as further described below. 

Prior to, and contingent
upon, the Closing, NEXT is to effect a recapitalization (the Recapitalization pursuant to which all convertible debt shall
be converted into common stock. The total number of shares of our Class A common stock to be issued to the NEXT stockholders, including
holders of NEXT Options and NEXT Warrants (the Merger Consideration shall be determined by dividing (i) 450,000,000, which
is the value of the Merger Consideration, by (ii) the Redemption Price, which is an amount equal to the price at which each public share
of our Class A common stock may be redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
The number of shares of our Class A common stock to be issued in respect of each share of NEXT Common Stock, determined after completion
of the Recapitalization (the Conversion Ratio ), shall be determined by dividing the Merger Consideration by the Total NEXT
Shares. The Total NEXT Shares shall mean the sum of (i) the number of shares of NEXT Common Stock outstanding after giving
effect to the Recapitalization (excluding (x) any shares held by NEXT or a subsidiary of NEXT, and (y) any shares of NEXT Common Stock
issuable upon conversion or exercise of the certain specified convertible securities and warrants), (ii) the number of shares of NEXT
Common Stock issued pursuant to a proposed equity financing by NEXT (iii) the number of shares of NEXT Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of outstanding NEXT Options, and, with certain exclusions, NEXT Warrants. No fractional shares of our Class A common stock shall be issued
to holders of NEXT Common Stock, and any fractional shares will be rounded down in the aggregate to the nearest whole share of Class A
common stock. 

Each option or warrant exercisable
for NEXT common stock that is not exercised prior to the Closing will be assumed by the Company and automatically converted into an option
or warrant exercisable for shares of our Class A common stock, in each case subject to the equivalent terms and conditions as the option
or warrant exercisable for NEXT common stock, with the number of shares of our Class A common stock and the exercise price being adjusted
to reflect the Conversion Ratio.

to the Company and NEXT; and (iv) the election of the members of the Company s board of directors following the closing, as described
below. 

Directors and Officers of the Company 

The parties will take all
necessary action to designate and nominate to the Company s board of directors seven directors, of which one person shall be designated
by the Company prior to the closing and (ii) six persons that are designated by NEXT prior to the Closing, at least four of whom shall
qualify as independent directors under Nasdaq rules. The Company will provide each director with a customary director indemnification
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such director. The parties further agreed to take all action necessary, including
causing the executive officers of the Company to resign, so that the individuals serving as the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, respectively, of NEXT immediately prior to the Closing shall become the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company on the Closing Date (unless, at its sole discretion, NEXT desires to appoint another qualified person reasonably acceptable
to the Company to either such role, in which case, such other person identified by NEXT shall serve in such role). 

Effective on the Closing
Date, the Company and certain key employees of NEXT will enter into employment agreements, effective as of the Closing, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company and NEXT. The agreement with NEXT s chief executive officer includes the grant of options,
which are not included in the Total Company Shares used to compute the Conversion Ratio. 

NEXT Equity Financing 

NEXT agreed to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into agreements with accredited investors with respect to the NEXT Equity Financing, the proceeds of which
may be used by NEXT for working capital. A NEXT Equity Financing means a private placement of NEXT securities pursuant to subscription
agreements entered into between NEXT and investors prior to the Closing on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. To the extent that
the NEXT Equity Financing involves the issuance of convertible securities, all such convertible securities shall be converted into NEXT
Common Stock on or prior to the Closing Date. Such shares of NEXT Common Stock and any shares of NEXT Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of any warrants which issued as part of the NEXT Equity Financing and not exercised prior to the Closing Date shall be included in computing
the Total NEXT Shares. 

Investor Notes 

In November 2022, NEXT entered
into a strategic investment agreement with United Airlines Ventures, a subsidiary of United Airlines Holdings, Inc. United ),
pursuant to which NEXT issued to United 500,000 shares of NEXT Common Stock at 5.00 per share and warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000
shares of NEXT Common Stock at exercise price of 5.00 per share and United could continue to invest up to a total of 37.5 million, as
long as NEXT meets certain milestones. 

The agreement contemplates
that NEXT and its operating subsidiary would issue to United 15 million in secured convertible notes (the Investor Notes ),
which would be jointly issued by NEXT and its operating subsidiary and would be convertible into Company Class A common stock at an agreed
upon discount, with NEXT issuing notes of like tenor to strategic investors and other approved investors as part of an issuance of notes
in the maximum principal amount of 50,000,000 or such other amount as is acceptable to NEXT, the Company and, if the amount is less than
 50,000,000, United. The terms of the Notes are to be acceptable to NEXT subject to the consent of the Company, such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed, denied or conditioned. The Company agreed that it would consent to the issuance of the Company Class A common stock
in connection with the conversion of these notes. See Agreement with United below.

The foregoing descriptions
of the NEXT Voting Agreements, NEXT Lock-Up Agreements, NEXT Non-Competition Agreements, and Sponsor Voting Agreement, and the transactions
and documents contemplated thereby, is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the NEXT Voting Agreements,
NEXT Lock-Up Agreements, NEXT Non-Competition Agreements, and Sponsor Voting Agreement, copies of which are filed with this Report as
Exhibits 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, and 10.11, respectively, and the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein. 

Other than as specifically
discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the NEXT Business Combination. 

Business Combination Criteria 

Our business combination criteria
are not limited to a particular industry or geographic sector, however, given the experience of our management team and board, we have
focused our search on industrial technology companies with an enterprise value of approximately 200 million to 900 million.
Management believes that this relative size of target opportunities has enabled the Company to pursue companies, such as NEXT, that are
the most attractive from a return standpoint and are less pursued by larger, more established sources of capital. 

We have identified the following
general criteria and guidelines that we believe are consistent with our acquisition philosophy and our management s experience,
and that we believe are important in evaluating prospective business combination opportunities. While we have used and will continue to
use these criteria and guidelines to evaluate business combination opportunities including the NEXT Business Combination, we may decide
to consummate our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. 

Large
and Compelling Growth Market. We are focused on investments in industry segments that we believe demonstrate
attractive long-term growth prospects and reasonable overall size or potential. We view growth as an important driver of value and
will seek companies whose growth potential can generate meaningful upside. 

Attractive, Inherently Profitable Business with High Operating Leverage. We seek to invest in companies that we believe possess not only established business models and sustainable competitive advantages, but also have inherently profitable unit economics. 

Strong Management Teams. We seek to acquire a business that has an experienced management team with a proven track record for producing rapid growth and with an ability to clearly and confidently articulate the business and market opportunities to public market investors. As such, we spend significant time assessing a company s leadership and personnel and evaluating what we can do to augment and/or upgrade the team over time as needed. 

Opportunity for Operational Improvements. We identify businesses that we believe are stable but at an inflection point and would benefit from our ability to drive improvements in the target s processes, go-to-market strategy, product or service offering, sales and marketing efforts, geographical presence and/or leadership team. 

Differentiated Products or Services. We evaluate metrics such as recurring revenues, product life cycle, cohort consistency, pricing per product or customer, cross-sell success and churn rates to focus on businesses whose products or services are differentiated or where we see an opportunity to create value by implementing best practices. 

Limited Technology Risk. We seek to invest in companies that have established market-tested products or service offerings, and do not lend themselves to erratic technology risks. 

Appropriate Valuations. We seek target companies for our initial business combination based on disciplined valuation-centric metrics. Management has significant negotiating and operating experience and recognizes the initial valuation is an important component of the ultimate rate of return. 

Benefit From Being a Public Company. We intend to pursue a business combination with a company that we believe will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 

Leading Industry Position and Competitive Market Advantage . We focus our search on one or more businesses based in the market and within industries that we believe have strong fundamentals, favorable prospects and a high likelihood of generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We seek to acquire a business whose products utilize a proprietary or patented technology, have dominate market position in a specific geographic or technological niche, or have some other form of distinct competitive advantage. The factors we consider include management s credentials, growth prospects, competitive dynamics, level of industry consolidation, need for capital investment, intellectual property, barriers to entry, and merger terms. 

9 

Potential to Grow, Including Through Further Acquisition Opportunities . We seek to acquire a business which has the potential to supplement its organic growth with a pipeline of potentially actionable acquisitions. We expect to work with the ongoing management team to develop the business strategy around geographic expansion, new products, high-return capital expenditure projects and acquisitions, as well as creating and maintaining the optimal capital structure for growth. 

High Organic Revenue Growth, Attractive Gross Margins, Prudent Debt. We seek to acquire a business that has the ability to grow rapidly across various market conditions and in varying economic cycles and the near-term potential to generate significant increases in revenue as well as strong and sustainable operating margins. To provide reliable guidance, we also seek to acquire a business that has strong visibility on forward financial performance and straightforward operating metrics. 

Sourced on a Proprietary Basis. We do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will leverage our extensive network to source a proprietary initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would consider participating in a process that is focused primarily on special purpose acquisition companies, where we would not compete with a conventional initial public offering or private equity acquisition, or at the tail end of a process when other alternatives have been eliminated, on the strength of our prior experience in closing business combinations or because our company is most appropriately sized to the target. 

Preparedness for the Process and Public Markets. We seek to acquire a business that has or can put in place prior to the closing of a business combination the governance, financial systems and controls required in the public markets. 

These criteria are not intended
to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant,
on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event
that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines,
we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria if our shareholder communications related to our initial business
combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable,
that we would file with the SEC, such as the NEXT Registration Statement. 

Competitive Strengths and Advantages 

We believe that our management
team is well positioned to consummate an initial business combination, such as the NEXT Business Combination, due to its combination of
operating and investing expertise. We believe that the most likely business combination targets have been those companies at a strategic
inflection point, such as rapidly growing companies stepping out from the control of private equity or venture capital owners, family-owned businesses
seeking some liquidity, or business units being carved out from larger conglomerates. In these scenarios in particular, we believe the
experience our management team brings in successfully scaling companies, especially those in the public markets, have been and will continue
to be looked upon favorably by both the target company as well as public stockholders. 

Specifically, we believe our
competitive strengths to be the following: 

Experienced Management Team . Our management team and strategic advisors have a substantial investment track record and advisory experience, significant knowledge of international energy and technology markets, access to proprietary deal flow, and strong relationships with business leaders and entrepreneurs in the industrial production, technology, and telecommunications industries. We believe their backgrounds allow us access to proprietary investment opportunities and position us to successfully complete an initial business combination. In addition, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in entrepreneurship, venture capital, public offerings, and acquisition led growth strategies across multiple industries but with a focus in the energy, industrial, technology and telecommunications space. 

Flexible Structure . With a public market for our common stock and approximately 178.5 million in trust at December 31, 2022, we have flexibility to be able to offer a target business a variety of options in structuring a transaction and funding future growth. Flexibility in using our capital stock, debt, cash or a mixture of the foregoing, allows us to work with a target company to accommodate their needs. 

Public Company Status. We believe our status as a public company makes us an attractive transaction partner to prospective target businesses. As a public company, we believe the target business would benefit from greater access to capital to fund future growth initiatives, further means of creating incentive and compensation plans for management that are closely aligned with stockholder s interests, and increased recognition and awareness potentially benefitting sales and recruiting. 

10 

Established Deal Sourcing Network and Personal Contacts . We intend to maximize our pipeline of potential target investments by proactively approaching our extensive network of contacts, including private equity and venture capital sponsors, family offices, executives of public and private companies, merger and acquisition advisory firms, investment banks, capital markets desks, lenders and other financial intermediaries. We believe the prior investment experience and track record of our team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer s prior involvement in successful investments, will give us a competitive advantage when sourcing potential initial business combination opportunities. Existing relationships with private equity and venture capital firms, and those through investment bankers are likely to provide us with potential combination targets. 

Deal-making and Capital Markets Experience through all Market Cycles. Our management team and strategic advisors consist of seasoned dealmakers with experience in a wide variety of industries, structures and market conditions, as well as experienced equity and debt capital markets professionals. Most have worked in the industrial technology markets globally, as principal investors and as advisors, through different market cycles. Our management team and strategic advisors apply the same disciplined approach to acquire a business that they have used in connection with their current advisory services and principal investment activities. 

Experience with Complex Transactions. Members of our management team and strategic advisors have a track record of completing transactions that involve an element of complexity not well-served by a competitive auction process and on educating counterparties about the benefits of the special purpose acquisition company structure and process. We believe that our management team and strategic advisors experience with complex situations requiring creative solutions is expected to lead to less competitive transactions. Members of our management team and strategic advisors also have a history of leveraging their relationship networks for due diligence and to develop a unique perspective and comfort with the issues faced in such complex opportunities . 

Public Company Operating Expertise. Our team has over 60 cumulative years of experience as either executive officers or directors of private and publicly traded companies, have the ability to shepherd targets through the going public process, and to navigate the ongoing challenges of operating as a public company. We anticipate that one or more members of our management team or board, would remain on the board of the company post business combination. In addition, some of the potential acquisition targets we consider may operate within a closely regulated industry. We believe that the expertise within our management team around closely regulated energy and telecommunications industries has been advantageous when evaluating certain acquisition targets. 

Investment Expertise. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying, evaluating, structuring, acquiring, and investing in privately held companies. Collectively, the members of our management team alone have been involved with or led multiple acquisitions and investments . 

Broad Sector Focused Expertise. Our management team brings deep expertise in a wide range of sub-sectors within our target industries. We believe that our diverse range of expertise increases our chances of identifying a business combination target where we have the expertise to appropriately diligence the investment and to provide value post business combination. Specifically, members of our management team have experience operating, investing or serving on boards of companies in the following sub-sectors: oil gas upstream, downstream and production, renewable and transition fuels, refineries, terminals and network integration. 

Initial Business Combination 

We have until April 14, 2023 to
consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination
by April 14, 2023, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination by an additional three months (or until July 14, 2023) to complete a business combination, subject to the sponsor depositing
additional funds into the trust account, upon five days advance notice prior to the deadline, 1,725,000 0.10 per unit), for the available
three month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of non-interest bearing loans. If we complete our initial business
combination, we will, at the option of our sponsor, repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us
or convert a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of 10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the private
units. If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans only from funds held outside of the trust account. Our stockholders
will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. 

On March 22, 2023, we filed with
the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to extend the date by which we must complete an initial business combination from April 14, 2023 to December 14, 2023, or such earlier
date as determined by the Company s board of directors. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the board of directors
decides to implement the Extension, the sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us loans equal to the lesser of (x) 35,000
or (y) 0.035 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month (commencing on April 15, 2023 and ending on the 14th
day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the business combination until December 14,
2023. Our shareholders will vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal at the special meeting of stockholder scheduled to be held on April
10, 2023. 

Our stockholders will be entitled
to vote and redeem their shares in connection with a stockholder meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender
offer undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during any three-month extension
period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but
not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the
trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released
to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of
claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation,
the private units will expire and will be worthless. 

11 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the
determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider
it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial
business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there
is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules,
any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 

We anticipate structuring
our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders
own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way
so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial
business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target,
our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we
would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our
stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned
or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be
taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target
business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses
together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. Based
on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of NEXT was substantially
in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 

Our Business Combination Process 

In evaluating prospective
business combinations such as the NEXT Business Combination, we conduct a thorough due diligence review process that encompasses, among
other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable),
on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem
appropriate. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or our officers or directors. While NEXT is
not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the NEXT Business Combination, and
we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or
a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or
an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Our officers and directors
indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering. Because of this ownership, our
sponsor and our officers and directors have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate
business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of
interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors
were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 

Each of our officers and directors
presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which
such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors has not and will not materially
affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we
renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to
such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually
permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer
that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 

12 

Our Management Team 

Members of our management
team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary
to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team devotes
in any time period will vary based on the current stage of the business combination process. 

We believe our management
team s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies have provided us with a substantial number of potential
business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts
and corporate relationships in various industries. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring
and financing businesses, our management team s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the
experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure as
a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business,
such as NEXT, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following
an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating
management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders interests than it would as a private company. A target business
can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a
business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target
business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A
common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding such exchange in the NEXT Business Combination. 

Although there are various
costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses, such as NEXT, will find this method a more
expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public
offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are
significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show
efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed
initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering
is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay
or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe
the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with
stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further
benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

While we believe that our
structure and our management team s backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view
our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed
initial business combination, negatively. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more
volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

13 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 14, 2026, (b) in which we
have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which
means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior
June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain
reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain
a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds
 250 million as of the end of the prior June 30 th , or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such
completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June
30 th . 

Financial Position 

With funds available for an
initial business combination in the amount of approximately 178.5 million as of December 31, 2022, we offer a target business such as
NEXT a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion
of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial
business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the
most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial
business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants,
the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements
or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the
owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek
to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development
or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance
of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and
we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust
account. In addition, we target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants, and may as a result, be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business
combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with
the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust
account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of
the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability
to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any
arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 

See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding the financing of and the agreements related to the NEXT Business Combination. 

14 

Sources of Target Businesses 

Target business candidates,
such as NEXT, may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals.
Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings.
These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many
of these sources will have read our prospectus in connection with our initial public offering or this Report and know what types of businesses
we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business
candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may
have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we may receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that
would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor
and their affiliates. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions,
in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s
length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the
use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis
with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily
tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event,
however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated,
be paid any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the
company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective
business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination. We pay our sponsor a total of 10,000 per
month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses
related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into
employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or
absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or
directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers
or directors. While NEXT is not affiliate with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event that we do not consummate the NEXT Business
Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with
our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company
from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he
or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity
to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial
business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial
community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses, or a valuation
based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider
it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial
business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there
is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple
businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will
have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be
permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

15 

In any case, we will only
complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses,
the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into
account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. 

To the extent we effect our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth
we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

In evaluating a prospective
business target, such as NEXT, we conduct a thorough due diligence review, which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent
management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial
and other information that will be made available to us. 

Any costs incurred with respect
to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed
will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period of
time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing
our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative
economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry
in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend
on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of NEXT, when evaluating the desirability of effecting
our initial business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the NEXT Business Combination is not consummated
and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct.
In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination
as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial
business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following
our initial business combination, including the NEXT Business Combination in which Scott Crist, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
will be on the board of directors of the combined company following completion of the merger, it is unlikely that he or any other director
will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members
of our post-closing management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target
business. 

We cannot assure you that
any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether
any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following an initial business
combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure
you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge
or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required
by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case with the NEXT Business Combination), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval
for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations
we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

TYPE OF TRANSACTION 
 WHETHER STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IS REQUIRED 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of the company with a target 
 Yes 

Under Nasdaq s listing
rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; 

any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the NEXT Business Combination. 

Permitted Purchases of our Securities 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that
such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases
that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant
to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None
of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases
of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder
approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement
would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding
or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination.
Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants
may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain
the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

17 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates
may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted
by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor,
officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling
stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial
business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination.
Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under
the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only
be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for
manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements
that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their
affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such
purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 

See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding such purchases in the NEXT Business Combination. 

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon
Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as
of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the NEXT Business Combination, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the
number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust
account was approximately 10.31 per public share, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds or additional funds,
if any, deposited into the trust account in connection with extensions of the period of time to consummate a business combination (as
described in more detail in this Report). The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will
not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered
into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares
and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial
business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, such
as the NEXT Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer, if the NEXT Business Combination is not consummated. The decision
as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us,
solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the
transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset
acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not
survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner
that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial
business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder
approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal
reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 

18 

If a stockholder vote is not
required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer
period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public
shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an
amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny
stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial
business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and
not complete the initial business combination. 

If, however, stockholder approval
of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business
or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a
 proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange 
 Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies,
 and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

In the event that we seek
stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our
public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If we seek stockholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor
of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of
outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement,
our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial
public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes
of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval
of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders founder shares,
we need only 6,468,751, or 37.5 , of the 17,250,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial
business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend
to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting,
if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorums and voting thresholds, and the
voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each
public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

19 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be
less than 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters 
fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset
or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial
business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred
to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions
in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required
to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash
conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we
will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption
will be returned to the holders thereof. 

See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the NEXT Business Combination. 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of
our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an
aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering (the Excess Shares ). Such restriction shall also be applicable
to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts
by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to
force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable
terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering
could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium
to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than
15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group
of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection
with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares)
for or against our initial business combination. 

See NEXT Business Combination 
above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the NEXT Business Combination. 

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection
with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We may require our public
stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials
mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the
event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder s
option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our
initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly,
a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up
to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares
if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to
use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

20 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering
process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the
tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee
would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need
to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a
holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such
stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an
 option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of
the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open
market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders
were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion
of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is
approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder
meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection
with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such
holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds
to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of
our initial business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If our initial proposed initial
business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target within
the Combination Period. 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
if no Initial Business Combination 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we will have only until the end of the Combination Period to complete our initial business combination.
If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the
public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up
to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any),
subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our
remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law
to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination during the Combination
Period. 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination during the Combination
Period. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
during the Combination Period. 

21 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete
our initial business combination during the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders 
rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their
shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released
to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public
shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation
of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s
 penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares
such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related
redemption of our public shares at such time. 

If we do not consummate our
initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we expect that all costs
and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining
out of the approximately 451,473 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that
there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust
account to pay any franchise and income tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not
required to pay franchise and income taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release
to us an additional amount of up to 50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by April 14, 2023, we may, by resolution
of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months
(for a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination until July 14, 2023), subject to the sponsor depositing into the trust
account, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, 1,725,000 0.10 per unit), for the available three month extension.
Our public shareholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination
from 15 months to 18 months described above or to redeem their shares in connection with such extension. 

On March 22, 2023, we filed with
the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to extend the date by which we must complete an initial business combination from April 14, 2023 to December 14, 2023, or such earlier
date as determined by the Company s board of directors. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the board of directors
decides to implement the Extension, the sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us loans equal to the lesser of (x) 35,000
or (y) 0.035 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month (commencing on April 15, 2023 and ending on the 14th
day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the business combination until December 14,
2023. Our shareholders will vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal at the special meeting of stockholder scheduled to be held on April
10, 2023. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, holders of our public shares are entitled to redeem their public shares
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest
shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. For more information, please see our proxy statement
on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on March 22, 2023. 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.31. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you
that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.31. Under Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made
in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our
remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient
to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we seek to have all
vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders,
there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from
bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other
similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect
to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving
such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will
only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement
would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that
refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management
to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable
to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters
of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

22 

In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than 10.20 per share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have
we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s
only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.
None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective
target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the
independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome
is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the
per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.20 per public share. 

We have sought and will continue
to seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring
to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with
us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable
as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have access to up to approximately 178.5 million from the proceeds of our initial
public offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation,
currently estimated to be no more than approximately 50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the
reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims
made by creditors. As of December 31, 2022, the amount held outside the trust account was 451,473. 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination during the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable
provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting
period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution
is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any
liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

23 

Furthermore, if the pro rata
portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete
our initial business combination during the Combination Period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such
redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due
to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims
of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating
distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination during the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all
operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes
(less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public
shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those
procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but
no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will
provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent
10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to
searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result
of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result
in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that
the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case
net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third-party claims. 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you
that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of
our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period (B) with respect to
any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption
of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination during the Combination Period, subject to applicable
law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek
stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the initial
business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the
trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with
a stockholder vote. 

24 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business, such as NEXT, for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds,
and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial,
technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore,
our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available
to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase option, and the future dilution they
potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive
disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We currently have two officers.
These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they
deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period
varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We have no full-time employees and do not intend to have
any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

Our units, Class A common
stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that
we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports,
including this Report, will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

We will provide stockholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business, such as the NEXT Registration Statement. In all likelihood, these
financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and
the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement
requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable
to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a
potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target
business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these
requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business
combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate
our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in
the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company,
will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity
to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12
of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention
of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation
of our initial business combination. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2027, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual
gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
during the prior three-year period.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other
factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, including the NEXT Business Combination, in the prescribed time frame; 

our ability to consummate an initial business combination may be adversely affected by economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, such as NEXT, may not be realized; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the NEXT Business Combination, or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial business combination; 

changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination; 

26 

if we do not complete the NEXT Business Combination, we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability; 

we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

we may attempt to complete
our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination
with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

our private placement warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination; 

changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per share; 

resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless; 

in March 2022,the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

27 

to mitigate the risk that
we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may at any time instruct the trustee to
liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in an interest bearing demand
deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following
the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on the funds held in the trust account, which
would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; 

we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

A 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption. 

there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial
reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence
in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results; 

Since all public shareholders have the right to have their public shares
redeemed in connection with the Extension, depending on the number public shares that are redeemed, the percentage ownership and voting
interest of the sponsor will increase. If 12,937,500 or more of the public shares are redeemed in connection with the Extension,
the sponsor s percentage voting and equity interest in the Company will increase from 20 to more than 50 in which event, since
the Class A and Class B common stock vote as a single class on the business combination, the sponsor may be able to approve the business
combination even if no public stockholder vote in favor of the business combination. 

28 

For the complete list of risks
relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) IPO Registration Statement, (ii) Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on April 11, 2022, and (iii) Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on May 23, 2022, August
15, 2022, and November 9, 2022, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial
business combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future
filings with the SEC. 

For risks related to NEXT
and the NEXT Business Combination, please see the NEXT Registration Statement once filed.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All statements other than
statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section regarding our financial
position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used
in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend 
and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements
are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual
results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in
our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes

Recent Developments 

On November 21, 2022, the
Company, NEXT and Merger Sub entered into the NEXT Merger Agreement pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into NEXT,
and NEXT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which will change its name to NXTCLEAN Fuels Inc., or such
other name as mutually agreed to by the Company and NEXT; and (ii) each stockholder of NEXT will receive newly-issued Company securities,
including, as applicable, shares of Class A common stock and/or options or warrants pursuant to which Class A common stock will be issued.
Prior to, and contingent upon, the closing of the NEXT Business Combination, the Company is to effect a recapitalization pursuant to which
all convertible debt shall be converted into common stock. 

On March 1, 2023, NEXT announced Lisa A. Holmes, MSHR, has been appointed
to the board of directors. 

For a full description of
the NEXT Merger Agreement and the proposed NEXT Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

On March 22, 2023, we filed with
the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to extend the date by which we must complete an initial business combination from April 14, 2023 to December 14, 2023, or such earlier
date as determined by the Company s board of directors. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the board of directors
decides to implement the Extension, the sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us loans equal to the lesser of (x) 35,000
or (y) 0.035 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month (commencing on April 15, 2023 and ending on the 14th
day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the business combination until December 14,
2023. Our shareholders will vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal at the special meeting of stockholder scheduled to be held on April
10, 2023. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, holders of our public shares are entitled to redeem their public shares
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest
shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. For more information, please see our proxy statement
on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on March 22, 2023. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in
any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering, and identifying a target company for a business
combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, we had a net income of 4,892,914, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account and
bank account of 2,539,764 and change in fair value of warrant liability of 4,420,646, offset by operating costs of 1,548,829 and offering
costs allocated to warrants at the IPO date of 27,670. 

For the period from January
4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had net loss of 3,758, which consisted of formation and operating costs of 3,768,
partially offset by bank interest income of 10. 

Liquidity, Going Concern and Capital Resources 

On January 14, 2022, we consummated
our initial public offering of 17,250,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 172,500,000. Simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO, we completed the private placement of an aggregate of 8,037,500 private placement warrants at a price of 1.00 per
private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 8,037,500. 

Following the IPO, the full
exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of 175,950,000 was placed in the trust
account. We incurred 10,799,030 in IPO-related costs, including 3,450,000 of underwriting commissions, 6,900,000 of deferred underwriting
commissions, and 449,030 of other offering costs, partially offset by the reimbursement of 1,035,000 of offering expenses by the underwriters. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was 1,378,921. Net income of 4,892,914 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities
held in the trust account of 2,537,410, financing costs of warrant issuance of 27,670, deferred tax benefit of 119,625 and change in
fair value of the warrant liability of 4,420,646. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 538,926 in cash for operating
activities. 

For the period from January
4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was 2,121. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had marketable securities held in the trust account of 178,487,410 (including approximately 2,537,410 of interest income) consisting
of securities held in a money market fund with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may
be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the trust account. 

31 

We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less income taxes
payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had cash of 451,473. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses,
perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses,
and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. 

In order to fund working capital
deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors
or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside
the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000
of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. 

In connection with the Company s
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update
2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until
April 2023, to consummate a business combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a business combination by
this time. Additionally, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to fund the working capital needs of the Company until one year
from the issuance of these financial statements. If a business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination
not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate in April 2023.
The Company intends to complete a business combination before the mandatory liquidation date. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of
the sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the
initial business combination or liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. 

The underwriters are entitled
to a deferred underwriting discount of 4.0 of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon the completion of the Company s initial business
combination. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

32 

Warrant Liability 

The Company accounts for private placement warrants
for shares of the Company s common stock that are not indexed to its own shares as liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet.
The private placement warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a
component of other income (expense), net on the statement of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes
in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the warrants. At that time, the portion of the warrant liability related
to the warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 

Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible
Redemption 

The Company s Class
A common stock sold as part of the units in the IPO contains a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares
in connection with the Company s liquidation, or if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s
initial business combination. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classifies such public shares subject to redemption outside
of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The public shares sold as part of the
units in the IPO will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants) and as such, the initial carrying value of
public shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The public shares
are subject to ASC 480-10-S99 and are currently not redeemable as the redemption is contingent upon the occurrence of events mentioned
above. According to ASC 480-10-S99-15, no subsequent adjustment is needed if it is not probable that the instrument will become redeemable. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock 

Net income (loss) per share
of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the
period. Remeasurement adjustment associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from income (loss) per share
of common stock as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06 Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 , to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments.
ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible
instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s
own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed
to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement
to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact,
if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management does not believe
that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results
of Operations 

Our results of operations
and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty
and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things,
downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply
chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and
the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict
the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business
and our ability to complete an initial business combination.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-21 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the lack of controls needed to assure we are differentiating
expenses incurred in connection with business combination transactions and should be expensed, from those that apply to financing transactions
which should be deferred and recorded as a reduction of proceeds upon the completion of a financing transaction. As a result, we performed
additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the period presented.. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to the previously discussed material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting related to the differentiation between expenses incurred in connection with a business combination and those that apply to financing
transactions that should be deferred and recorded as a reduction of proceeds upon completion of a financing transaction. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our
status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Other than as discussed above,
there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information. 

None. 

Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent
Inspections.

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We currently have five directors.
Our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except
for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following
our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Clark and Moore will expire at our first
annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Crist and Smith, and Ms. Viswanathan,
will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. 

Our officers are appointed
by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of
directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our
officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents, Secretary,
Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq
rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Moore and Clark and Ms. Viswanathan serve as members of our audit committee, and
Mr. Moore chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least
three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Messrs. Moore and Clark and Ms. Viswanathan meet the
independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit committee
is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Moore qualifies as an audit committee financial
expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit committee
charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the
appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged
by us; 

pre-approving all
audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing
pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Moore and Clark serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing
standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent
Messrs. Moore and Clark are independent, and Mr. Moore chairs the compensation committee. 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as indicated above, other than the payment to our sponsor of 10,000 per month, for up until the end of the Combination Period, for office
space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders,
consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly,
it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for
the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or
other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Director Nominations 

We do not have a standing
nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or
Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director
nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry
out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Moore and Clark and Ms. Viswanathan.
In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee,
we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

The board of directors will
also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees
to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders
that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws. 

39 

We have not formally established
any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying
and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge
of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a code of
ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our code of ethics and our audit and compensation
committee charters as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement. You can review these documents by accessing our public filings at the
SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request
from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our code of ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 

None of our officers has received
any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We pay our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial
and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. No compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment
of a loan, will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection
with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). 

However, these individuals
are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all
payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business
combination are made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not
expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. 

After the completion of our
initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees
from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have not
established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It
is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors
of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid
to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted
solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We do not intend to take any
action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with
us after our initial business combination. The NEXT Merger Agreement provides for the Company to designate one member of our post-closing
Board of Directors, which designee may be one of our current directors or executive officers. The existence or terms of any such employment
or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements
with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 28, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons
named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

40 

each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group. 

In the table below, percentage
ownership is based on 21,562,500 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 17,250,000 shares of our Class A common stock and (ii)
4,312,500 shares of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of March 28, 2023. On all matters to be voted upon, except for
the election of directors of the board, holders of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together
as a single class. Currently, all of the shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

Unless otherwise indicated,
we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially
owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants
are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence. 

On January 12, 2021,
we issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000 in cash, or approximately
 0.006 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent
20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering. Up to 562,500 founder shares were subject to forfeiture
by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised. The founder shares (including
the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned
or sold by the holder. As a result of the full exercise of which the underwriters over-allotment option, no founder shares
are subject to forfeiture. 

Our sponsor purchased an aggregate
of 8,037,500 warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of 8,037,500. The private placement warrants are
identical to the units sold in our initial public offering except that the private placement warrants, so long as they are held by our
sponsor, the underwriters or their permitted transferees, (i) will not be redeemable by us, (ii) may not (including the Class A
common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the
holders until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless
basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. The private placement warrants (including the shares of Class A common
stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he
or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary
duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

We pay our sponsor a total
of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination
or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

Other than the foregoing,
no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a
loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or
in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the
type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates
and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

Our sponsor agreed to loan
us up to 300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering. This loan was non-interest bearing, unsecured
and due at the earlier of March 31, 2022 or the closing of our initial public offering. As of December 31, 2021, 127,385 was outstanding
under the promissory note. The loan was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering out of the offering proceeds that
were allocated to the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). The Company overpaid 26,615 to the sponsor
upon the closing of our initial public offering, which was returned by the sponsor on January 19, 2022. 

In addition, in order to finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of
our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.
Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent warrants at a price of 1.00
per warrant (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares if 1,500,000 of
notes were so converted), at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as
to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such Working Capital Loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect
to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

After our initial business
combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company
with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation
materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of
distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination,
as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 

We have entered into a registration
rights agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, the securities underlying the unit purchase option, the securities issuable
upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (if any) and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or
exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the founder shares. 

For more information on the
agreements entered into in connection with the NEXT Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business.

Director Independence 

Nasdaq listing standards require
that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other
than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the
company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Clark and Moore and Ms. Viswanathan are independent directors 
as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which
only independent directors are present. 

Item 14 . Principal Accountant Fees
and Services. 

The following is a summary
of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum, for services rendered. 

Audit Fees 

Audit fees consist of fees
for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum
in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Marcum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial
statements, review of the financial information include in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with the
SEC for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 totaled approximately
 184,684 and 70,545, respectively. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee
meetings. 

Audit-Related Fees 

Audit-related fees consist
of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements
and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation
and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Marcum for consultations concerning financial
accounting and reporting standards for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December
31, 2021. 

Tax Fees 

We did not pay Marcum for
tax services, planning or advice for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December
31, 2021. 

All Other Fees 

We did not pay Marcum for
any other services for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021. 

Pre-Approval Policy 

Our audit committee was formed
upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services,
although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation
of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted
non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions
for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of 

Industrial Tech Acquisitions II, Inc 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited
the accompanying balance sheets of Industrial Tech Acquisitions II, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit) equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for
the period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the
period from January 4, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1
to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company s cash
and working capital as of December 31, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in
Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
