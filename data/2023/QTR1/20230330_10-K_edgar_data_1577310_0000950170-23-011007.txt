 There is no significant update regarding the litigation matters described in Redwood s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the heading Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 
 Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 The seller and servicing administrator, the sponsor and the depositor are each either directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. There is not currently, and there was not during the past two years, any material business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding that is or was entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is or was on terms other than would be obtained in an arm s length transaction with an unrelated third party, between (a) any of the seller, the sponsor, the depositor and the issuing entity on the one hand and (b) any of the trustee, any servicer, the custodian, the master servicer, the securities administrator or either originator of the mortgage loans on the other hand. 
 Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15. 
 The registrant has prepared the Table below in connection with this transaction. The Table shows, in one compiled format, which entity participating in a servicing function for this transaction was assigned responsibility for each criterion in Item 1122(d). In the Table below, certain criteria are not applicable, given the structure of the offering, and accordingly no entity is assigned responsibility for such criteria. 
 On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo transferred substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services business to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. CTCNA and its affiliates. For certain transactions where one or more of Wells Fargo s roles did not transfer to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. on November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo engaged CTCNA as its agent to perform certain duties under the related transaction documents. Therefore, the report on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation report on such assessment of compliance of CTCNA, as agent to Wells Fargo, in its capacity as custodian are included under Item 15. See also Explanatory Note #2. 
 Also, Wilmington Trust, National Association Wilmington ), the trustee, does not participate in any servicing function for the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing. Therefore, there is no reference to Wilmington in the chart below; nor does this 10-K filing include any assessment or auditor report from Wilmington. Finally, any discrepancies between the chart below and the assessment of compliance exhibit provided by any party listed in the chart is explained by the fact that the chart is specific to the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing, whereas each party s respective assessment of compliance is issued on a platform basis and includes coverage of other additional transactions that are not the subject of this 10-K filing.

Management s Assertion 
 
 Management of First Republic Bank (the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans serviced for others (the Platform), except for the servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 
 The Bank s management has assessed the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set 
 forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Management Assessment 
 Management of the Cenlar FSB (Cenlar or the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(xi), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. These criteria are not applicable to the Bank because the Bank does not perform activities with respect to the Platform relating to these criteria. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(i), management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria, has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank asserts that it has policies and procedures in place, designed and operating effectively, to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in our assertion. 
 The Bank's management has assessed the Bank's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 11 22 of Regulation AB. 
 Based on such assessment, management has concluded that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria, except as set forth in the column titled Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Appendix B, set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management 's assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors 
 CitiMortgage, Inc.: 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that CitiMortgage, Inc. (the Servicer) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(v),1122(d)(2)(vii), 1122(d)(3)(i) through 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i) through 1122(d)(4)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv); of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for servicing of residential mortgage loans included in publicly issued residential mortgage-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, certain publicly issued residential mortgage-backed securities issued prior to January 1, 2006, and certain residential mortgage transactions for which the Servicer has agreed to apply the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB for which the Servicer performs a particular servicing function pursuant to a servicing agreement with a third party, except for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, and Government National Mortgage Association residential mortgage loan securitization unless notified that the residential mortgage loans are part of a special bond program (the Platform), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Servicer s management has determined that all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Servicer because the Servicer does not perform activities with respect to the Platform relating to those criteria. The Servicer has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i) is applicable to the activities the Servicer performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to collection activities for outstanding documents and preparing and shipping the documents to another party participating in the servicing function. The Servicer has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(ii) is applicable to the activities the Servicer performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to collection activities for outstanding documents. With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Servicer has determined that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Servicer to perform such activities. The Servicer has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable to the activities the Servicer performs with respect to the Platform for all transactions and securities in the Platform, including those issued on or before November 23, 2015 for which compliance was previously assessed under other servicing criteria, as applicable, for the assessment period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Exhibit B to the Management Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Servicer s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Servicer s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Servicer s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Servicer processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Servicer during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Servicer during 
 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of 
 the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with 
 KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. 

the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Servicer s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Exhibit A to the Management Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, the Servicer has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required for certain activities related to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(ii). The Servicer has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Servicer has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.60, Vendors Engaged by Servicer (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Servicer has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Servicer is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Servicer s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that CitiMortgage, Inc. (the Servicer) complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(ii), as described in Exhibit A to the Management Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that the Agency and Trust division of Citibank, N.A. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria except for Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii)-1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, for publicly- issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 for which the Company provides the following servicing functions: paying agent, securities administration and trustee; or securities administration and paying agent; or paying agent and trustee; or paying agent (the Platform ), as listed in Appendix A of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance. The Platform also includes transactions for which the Company is not a party to the transaction agreements, but for which securities administration servicing functions have been outsourced to the Company by a party to the transaction agreements as listed in Appendix B of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance. Additionally, for certain transactions included in the Platform, the Company began providing additional servicing activities on behalf of the party appointed as Trust Administrator per the transaction agreements as of the effective dates set forth in Appendix C of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance. 
 
 The Company has determined that Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. With respect to Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(1)(ii), there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. With respect to the transactions listed in Appendix B of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, the Company is asserting to compliance with Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i)(A), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), as well as 1122(d)(3)(ii), but only as it relates to the allocation of amounts due to investors in accordance with the distribution priority and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements. With respect to the transactions listed in Appendix C of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, as of the effective dates listed in Appendix C of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, the Company began providing servicing activities on behalf of the party appointed as Trust Administrator per the transaction agreements with respect to Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D) and 1122(d)(3)(ii). Prior to the effective dates listed in Appendix C of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) was applicable to the Company for the transactions listed in Appendix C of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance solely with respect to remittances.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 
 First Republic Bank: 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion, that First Republic Bank (the Bank) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for residential mortgage loans serviced for others (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A to Management s Assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Management s Assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Bank has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Cenlar FSB: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Assessment, that Cenlar FSB (the Bank) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the residential mortgage loans platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 11 22(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xi) which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix A of Management s Assessment for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Bank processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Bank is responsible for assessing compliance with 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of Cenlar FSB and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(2)(i), the Bank has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by this servicing criterion. The Bank has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As 
 
 A member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Bank s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the 
 aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the residential mortgage loans platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
