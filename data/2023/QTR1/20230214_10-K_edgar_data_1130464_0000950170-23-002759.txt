It accommodates scheduling transactions in both directions simultaneously, provides additional opportunities to sell excess generation or to make economic purchases to serve our native load and contract obligations, and enables us to take advantage of power price differentials between the two grids. The total transfer capacity of the tie is 400 MW, including 200 MW from West to East and 200 MW from East to West.

 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 History and Organization 
 Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (together with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as the Company, we, us or our ), is a customer-focused, growth-oriented utility company headquartered in Rapid City, South Dakota (incorporated in South Dakota in 1941). 
 
 We operate our business in the United States, reporting our operating results through our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities segments. Certain unallocated corporate expenses that support our operating segments are presented as Corporate and Other. 
 
 Our Electric Utilities segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity to approximately 220,000 electric utility customers in Colorado, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. We also own and operate non-regulated power generation and mining assets that are vertically integrated into and primarily contracted to our Electric Utilities. Our Electric Utilities own 1,482 MW of generation and 9,024 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines. 
 
 Our Gas Utilities segment serves approximately 1,107,000 natural gas utility customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Our Gas Utilities own and operate 4,713 miles of intrastate gas transmission pipelines and 42,222 miles of gas distribution mains and service lines, seven natural gas storage sites, more than 50,000 horsepower of compression and over 515 miles of gathering lines. 
 
 Electric Utilities 
 
 We conduct electric utility operations through our Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming subsidiaries. Our electric generating facilities and power purchase agreements provide for the supply of electricity principally to our retail customers. Additionally, we sell excess power to other utilities and marketing companies, including our affiliates. We also provide non-regulated services to our retail customers under the Service Guard Comfort Plan and Tech Services.

Purchased Power. We have executed various PPAs to support our Electric Utilities capacity and energy needs beyond our regulated power plants generation, which include long-term related party agreements with our non-regulated power generation businesses. See additional information in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Coal Mining. We own and operate a single coal mine through our WRDC subsidiary which is reported within our Electric Utilities segment. We surface mine, process and sell low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal at our mine located immediately adjacent to our Gillette energy complex in the Powder River Basin in northeastern Wyoming, where our five coal-fired power plants are located. We produced approximately 3.7 million tons of coal in 2022. 
 
 The mine provides low-sulfur coal directly to these five power plants via a conveyor belt system, minimizing transportation costs. The fuel can be delivered to our adjacent power plants at very cost competitive prices (i.e., 1.09 per MMBtu for year ended December 31, 2022) when compared to alternatives. Nearly all of the mine s production is sold to our on-site generation facilities under long-term supply contracts. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we estimated our recoverable reserves to be approximately 174 million tons, based on a life-of-mine engineering study utilizing currently available drilling data and geological information prepared by internal engineering analyses. The recoverable reserve life is equal to approximately 47 years at the current production levels. 
 
 Transmission and Distribution. Through our Electric Utilities, we own electric transmission and distribution systems composed of high voltage lines (greater than 69 kV) and low voltage lines (69 kV or less). We also jointly operate an electric transmission system, referred to as the Common Use System, with Basin Electric Power Cooperative and Powder River Energy Corporation. Each participant in the Common Use System individually owns assets that are operated together for a single system. The Common Use System also provides transmission service to our Transmission Tie. South Dakota Electric owns 35 of the Transmission Tie. The Transmission Tie is further discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our Electric Utilities owned the electric transmission and distribution lines shown below:

Material transmission services agreements are disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Seasonal Variations of Business. Our Electric Utilities are seasonal businesses and weather patterns may impact their operating performance. Demand for electricity is sensitive to seasonal cooling, heating and industrial load requirements, as well as market price. In particular, cooling demand is often greater in the summer and heating demand is often greater in the winter.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Competition. We generally have limited competition for the retail generation and distribution of electricity in our service areas. Various legislative or regulatory restructuring and competitive initiatives have been discussed in several of the states in which our utilities operate. These initiatives would be aimed at increasing competition or providing for distributed generation. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our utilities. In Colorado, our electric utility is subject to rules which may require competitive bidding for generation supply. Because of these rules, we face competition from other utilities and non-affiliated IPPs for the right to supply electric energy and capacity for Colorado Electric when resource plans require additional resources. Additionally, electrification initiatives in our service territories could increase demand for electricity and increase customer growth. 
 
 The independent power industry consists of many strong and capable competitors, some of which may have more extensive operations or greater financial resources than we possess. With respect to the merchant power sector, FERC has taken steps to increase access to the national transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity to foster competition within the wholesale electricity markets. Our non-regulated power generation businesses could face greater competition if utilities are permitted to robustly invest in power generation assets. Conversely, state regulations requiring utilities to competitively bid generation resources may provide opportunity for IPPs in some regions. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our non-regulated power generation businesses. 
 
 Our mining business strategy is to sell nearly all of our production to on-site generation facilities under long-term supply contracts. Historically, any off-site sales have been to consumers within close proximity to the WRDC mine. Rail transport market opportunities for WRDC are limited due to the lower heating value (Btu) of the coal, combined with the fact that the WRDC mine is served by only one railroad, resulting in less competitive transportation rates. Additionally, coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. Costs and other factors relating to these alternative fuels, such as safety, environmental and availability considerations affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel. 
 
 Operating Statistics . See a summary of key operating statistics in the Electric Utilities segment operating results within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Gas Utilities 
 
 We conduct natural gas utility operations through our Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming subsidiaries. Our Gas Utilities transport and distribute natural gas through our distribution network to approximately 1,107,000 customers. Additionally, we sell contractual pipeline capacity and gas commodities to other utilities and marketing companies, including our affiliates, on an as-available basis. 
 
 We also provide non-regulated services to our regulated customers. Black Hills Energy Services provides natural gas supply to approximately 52,600 retail distribution customers under the Choice Gas Program in Nebraska and Wyoming. Additionally, we provide services under the Service Guard Comfort Plan, Tech Services and HomeServe.

We procure natural gas for our distribution customers from a diverse mix of producers, processors and marketers and generally use hedging, physical fixed-price purchases and market-based price purchases to achieve dollar-cost averaging within our natural gas portfolio. The majority of our procured natural gas is transported in interstate pipelines under firm transportation service agreements. 
 
 In addition to company-owned natural gas storage assets in Arkansas, Colorado and Wyoming, we also contract with third-party transportation providers for natural gas storage service to provide gas supply during the winter heating season and to meet peak day customer demand for natural gas.

Seasonal Variations of Business. Our Gas Utilities are seasonal businesses and weather patterns may impact their operating performance. Demand for natural gas is sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements, as well as market price. In particular, demand is often greater in the winter months for heating. Natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, and demand for this product can depend heavily upon weather throughout our service territories. As a result, a significant amount of natural gas revenue is normally recognized in the heating season consisting of the first and fourth quarters. Demand for natural gas can also be impacted by summer temperatures and precipitation, which can affect demand for irrigation. 
 
 Competition. We generally have limited competition for the retail distribution of natural gas in our service areas. Various restructuring and competitive initiatives have been discussed in several of the states in which our utilities operate. These initiatives are aimed at increasing competition. Additionally, electrification initiatives in our service territories could negatively impact demand for natural gas and decrease growth. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our utilities. Although we face competition from independent marketers for the sale of natural gas to our industrial and commercial customers, in instances where independent marketers displace us as the seller of natural gas, we still collect fees for transporting the gas through our distribution network.

 Utility Regulation Characteristics 
 
 Our Utilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 State public utility commissions, which have jurisdiction over services and facilities, rates and charges, accounting, valuation of property, depreciation rates and various other matters; 

the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things; 

the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts; 

the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts; 

the TSA, which regulates certain activities related to the safety and security of natural gas pipelines. In May and July 2021 the TSA issued security directives that included several new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators; and 

the PHMSA, which is responsible for administering the federal regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. 

Rates and Regulation 
 
 Our Utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the public utility commissions in the states where they operate and the FERC for certain assets and transactions. These commissions oversee services and facilities, rates and charges, accounting, valuation of property, depreciation rates and various other matters. Rate decisions are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, capital expenditures, the prudence of costs we incur, views concerning appropriate rates of return, general economic conditions and the political environment. Certain commissions also have jurisdiction over the issuance of debt or securities and the creation of liens on property located in their states to secure bonds or other securities. 
 
 The regulatory provisions for recovering the costs of service vary by jurisdiction. Our Utilities have cost recovery mechanisms that allow us to pass the prudently-incurred cost of natural gas, fuel and purchased power to customers. These mechanisms allow the utility operating in that state to collect or refund the difference between the cost of commodities and certain services embedded in our base rates and the actual cost of the commodities and certain services without filing a general rate review. In addition, some jurisdictions allow us to recover certain costs or earn a return on capital investments placed in service between base rate reviews through approved rider tariffs, such as energy efficiency plan costs and system safety and integrity investments. These tariffs allow the utility a return on the investment.

Recent Tariff Filings 
 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding current regulatory activity. 
 
 FERC 
 
 The Federal Power Act gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, all public utilities subject to FERC s jurisdiction must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with FERC that govern the rates, and terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Public utilities are also subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by FERC. FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between public utilities and their affiliates. Our public Electric Utility subsidiaries provide FERC-jurisdictional services subject to FERC s oversight. 
 
 Our Electric Utilities entities are authorized by FERC to make wholesale sales of electric capacity and energy at market-based rates under tariffs on file with FERC. As a condition of their market-based rate authority, Electric Quarterly Reports are filed with FERC. Our Electric Utilities own and operate FERC-jurisdictional interstate transmission facilities and provide open access transmission service under tariffs on file with FERC. Our Electric Utilities are subject to routine audit by FERC with respect to their compliance with FERC s regulations. 
 
 PUHCA 2005 provides FERC authority with respect to the books and records of a utility holding company. As a utility holding company whose assets consist primarily of investments in our subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are public utilities and also a centralized service company subsidiary, BHSC, we are subject to FERC s authority under PUHCA 2005. 
 
 PUHCA 2005 reiterated the definition and benefits of EWG status. Under PUHCA 2005, an EWG is an entity or generator engaged, directly or indirectly through one or more affiliates, exclusively in the business of owning, operating or both owning and operating all or part of one or more eligible facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale. Though EWGs are public utilities within the definition set forth in the Federal Power Act and are subject to FERC regulation of rates and charges, they are exempt from other FERC requirements. Through its subsidiaries, Black Hills Corporation is affiliated with three EWGs, Wygen I, Pueblo Airport Generation (facilities #4-5) and Northern Iowa Windpower. Each of these three EWGs have been granted market-based rate authority. 
 
 NERC 
 
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions to create an Electric Reliability Organization, which is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC certified NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards can be subject to fines and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.

 Pipeline Security 
 
 In May and July 2021, the TSA issued security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred earlier in 2021 that included several new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators. Among these requirements is the implementation of specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information and operational technology systems; development and implementation of a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; and performance of a cybersecurity architecture design review. We have implemented several of these directives and are evaluating the potential effect of several others on our operations and facilities, as well as the potential cost of implementation, and will continue to monitor for any clarifications or amendments to these directives. 
 
 Gas Pipeline and Storage Integrity and Safety 
 
 We are subject to regulation by PHMSA, which requires the following for certain gas distribution and transmission pipelines and underground storage facilities: inspection and maintenance plans; integrity management programs, including the determination of pipeline integrity risks and periodic assessments on certain pipeline segments; an operator qualification program, which includes certain trainings; a public awareness program that provides certain information; and a control room management plan. If we fail to comply with applicable statutes and the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety s rules and related regulations and orders, we could be subject to significant penalties and fines. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 We have clean energy goals to reduce GHG emissions that are based on prudent and proven solutions while minimizing cost impacts to and ensuring safety of our customers. See more information in Key Elements of our Business Strategy within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We are subject to significant state and federal environmental regulations that encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken initiatives to meet current requirements and to prepare for anticipated future regulations, reduce GHG emissions, and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Compliance with future environmental regulations could result in substantial cost. 
 
 In July of 2019, the EPA adopted the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which requires states to develop plans by 2022 for GHG reductions from coal-fired power plants. In a January 2021 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision vacating and remanding the Affordable Clean Energy rule. Four petitions for review of the D.C. Circuit s opinion were subsequently granted by the U.S. Supreme Court on October 29, 2021, consolidated under West Virginia v. EPA et al. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court released its opinion in favor of West Virginia and aligned parties. The decision clarifies that there are limits on how the EPA may regulate GHGs absent further direction from the U.S. Congress. The court concluded that emission caps that would cause generation shifting from fossil-fuel-fired power plants to renewable energy facilities would require specific congressional authorization and that such authorization had not been given under the Clean Air Act. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court may affect the EPA s development of any new regulations to address CO 2 emissions from coal- and natural gas-fired power plants; however, at this time, we cannot predict the impact of any such regulations or the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The EPA has indicated that it intends to issue a proposed rule in early 2023 with a new set of emission guidelines for states to follow in submitting state plans to establish and implement standards of performance for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. We will continue to monitor any related guidelines and rulemakings issued by the EPA or state regulatory authorities. 
 In February 2022, the EPA proposed the Good Neighbor Rule Provisions, which are part of the CSAPR framework and is intended to address ozone transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The rule focuses on reductions of NO x , which is a precursor to ozone formation, for states that do not have an approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). On January 31, 2023, the EPA finalized a notice which disapproved 19 SIPs, partially disapproved two other SIPs and deferred action until December 2023 on two SIPs, which included Wyoming. The EPA action on January 31, 2023 was a necessary prerequisite for the EPA to finalize a proposed Good Neighbor Rule by the March 15, 2023 deadline. The EPA also released a new air quality modeling that indicated two states (including Wyoming), which were previously within scope of the Good Neighbor Rule, no longer exceeded the cross-state ozone emissions threshold. It is likely that the EPA will rely on this new air quality modeling as part of the final Good Neighbor Rule. Based on the new air quality modeling, Wyoming will not be required to purchase additional NO x allowances during the 2023 ozone season. Until the EPA takes action on Wyoming's SIP, which is anticipated in December 2023, we cannot determine our future CSAPR compliance costs or impacts on our operations, but they could be material. However, we anticipate that any costs incurred as a result of the proposed rule would be recoverable through our regulatory mechanisms. 
 
 Environmental risk changes constantly with the implementation of new or modified regulations, changing stakeholder interests and needs, and through the introduction of innovative work practices and technologies. We continually assess risk and develop mitigation strategies to manage and ensure compliance across the enterprise successfully and responsibly. For additional information on environmental matters, see Item 1A and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. Risks that may adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. These risk factors, along with other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. 
 
 STRATEGIC RISK 
 
 Our continued success is dependent on execution of our business plan and growth strategy, including our capital investment program. 
 
 Our continued success depends, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans, including our growth strategy. Our plans and strategy include building sustainable operations and supporting the Energy Transition; consistently outperforming utility industry averages in key safety metrics; modernizing utility infrastructure; transforming the customer experience; growing our electric and natural gas customer load; and pursuing operational efficiencies. Our current plans and strategy may be negatively impacted by disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace, workforce capabilities, changing political, business or regulatory conditions and technology advancements. 
 
 In addition, we have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years that are key to our strategic business plans. The successful execution of our capital investment program depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: availability of low cost capital to fund projects, weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, impacts of supply chain disruptions on availability and cost of materials, governmental approvals and permitting, regulatory cost recovery and return on investment. 
 
 An inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS 
 
 We may be subject to unfavorable or untimely federal and state regulatory outcomes. 
 
 Our regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service/rate-of-return regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our customer rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and investments, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that our various regulatory authorities will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will result in full or timely recovery of our costs with a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition, adverse rate decisions, including rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, could be influenced by competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception and regulatory pressures and adversely impact earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 Each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs, including costs from certain severe weather events, or integrity capital investments) outside of a base rate review in order to stabilize customer rates and reduce regulatory lag. If regulators decide to discontinue these tariff-based recovery mechanisms, it could negatively impact earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 Costs could significantly increase to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future environmental laws, regulations or requirements including those associated with climate change. 
 
 Our business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions (i.e., SO 2 , NO x , volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG), water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. 
 
 These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other government approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure or inability to comply with evolving environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. 
 
 23 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Our business segments may not be successful in recovering increased capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities. 
 
 There is significant uncertainty regarding if and when new climate legislation, regulations or administrative policies will be adopted to reduce or limit GHG and the impact any such regulations would have on us. New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or capacity reductions of coal-fired power generation facilities or conversion to natural gas, and potential increased production from our combined cycle natural gas-fired generating units. Additional rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas storage facilities or our coal mine. Further, these rules could create the need to purchase or build clean-energy fuel sources to fulfill obligations to our customers. These actions could also result in increased operating costs which could adversely impact customers and our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. We cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory requirements may result in compliance penalties. 
 
 Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, NERC, PHMSA, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC, TSA and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny our franchise privileges. 
 
 Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. We regularly engage in negotiations on renewals of franchise agreements with our municipal governments. We have from time to time faced challenges or ballot initiatives on franchise renewals. To date, we have been successful in resolving or defending most of these challenges. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. We also cannot quantify the impact that such action would have on the remainder of our business operations. 
 
 Changes in Federal tax law may significantly impact our business. 
 
 We are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we operate. Sweeping legislation or regulation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which may affect our tax burden. Changes may include numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which a change in corporate tax rate will affect our utility customers and the time period over which that change will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates. 
 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation. 
 Material legal proceedings are summarized in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which we are involved or other future legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse effect on our financial operating results, including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.

OPERATING RISKS 
 
 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could have a negative impact on our operations and long-term business strategy. 
 
 Recent trends, such as higher turnover, a competitive and tight labor market and an aging workforce may lead to higher costs and increased risk of negative outcomes for safety, compliance, customer service, and operations. Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2022, approximately 19 of our employees were eligible for retirement. Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk with approximately 25 of our employees represented by unions. Failure to hire and retain qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected . 
 
 Our plans and strategy include building sustainable operations and supporting the Energy Transition; consistently outperforming utility industry averages in key safety metrics; modernizing utility infrastructure; transforming the customer experience; growing our electric and natural gas customer load; and pursuing operating efficiencies. As part of our strategic plan, we will need to attract and retain personnel who are qualified to implement our strategy and may need to retrain or re-skill certain employees to support our long-term objectives. 
 
 The nature of our business subjects us to climate-related risk, stemming from both physical risk and transition risk of climate change, over varying time horizons. 
 
 Physical risks of climate change refer to risks to our facilities or operations that may result from changes in the physical climate, such as changes to temperature and weather patterns. Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, fluctuations in customers energy usage could be magnified. Climate change may lead to increased intensity and frequency of storms, resulting in increased likelihood of fire, wind and extreme temperature events. Severe weather events, such as snow and ice storms (e.g., Winter Storm Uri), fire, and strong winds could negatively impact our operations, including our ability to provide energy safely, reliably and profitably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned. Unmitigated impacts of climate change may intensify these events or increase the frequency of their occurrence. Over time, we may need to make additional investments to protect our facilities from physical risks of climate change. 
 
 Transition risks of climate change include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies, changing customer demand and/or expectations and voluntary GHG reduction goals, as well as local, state or federal regulatory requirements (discussed above) intended to reduce GHG emissions. Policies such as a carbon or methane tax could increase costs associated with fossil fuel usage, resulting in higher operating costs including costs of energy generation, construction, and transportation. Risks of the transition to a low-carbon economy could result in shrinking customer demand for fossil fuel-based energy sources. This could come from increased use of behind the meter technology, such as residential solar and storage. Risk of investor pressure over climate risk and/or ESG standards, activist campaigns against coal producers, employee preferences to work for sustainable companies and consumers preference for renewable energy could impact our reputation and overall access to capital and/or adequate insurance policies. 
 
 Supply chain challenges could negatively impact our operations. 
 
 We rely on various suppliers in our supply chain for the materials necessary to execute on our capital investment program that is key to our strategic business plans and to respond to a significant unplanned event such as a natural disaster. Our largest customers also rely on our supply chain and delays in critical materials could impact their ability to operate and grow as planned. Our supply chain, material costs, and capital investment program may be negatively impacted by: 
 Unanticipated price increases due to recent macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, including wage inflation, or rising demand for raw materials associated with the Energy Transition; and 

Supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers such as disruption of the freight system (e.g. railroad labor union strikes), increased environmental threats from weather-related disasters, rising demand for raw materials associated with the Energy Transition and/or geopolitical unrest (e.g. Russian invasion of Ukraine). 

An inability to successfully manage challenges in our supply chain network could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.

 Cyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts targeting our key technology systems could disrupt our operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. 
 
 To effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, information and operation technology systems and network infrastructure to generate, distribute and deliver energy, and collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or natural gas operations. Attacks targeting other key technology systems, including our third-party vendors information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations. Recent geopolitical conflicts (e.g. Russia's invasion of Ukraine) have increased the risk of cyberattack. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and associated revenues, as well as significant expense to repair damages and remedy security breaches. In addition, any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others. We maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. 
 
 As discussed in Utility Regulation Characteristics above, in 2021 the TSA issued security directives that included several new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators. Such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates. 
 
 We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our technology systems may still be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. 
 
 Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, natural gas storage facilities and a coal mine. 
 
 The risks associated with managing these operations include: 
 Operating hazards. Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions, could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence; 

Inherent dangers. Electricity and natural gas can be dangerous to employees and the general public. Failures of or contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines or service facilities and equipment may result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injuries, including death. While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance; 

Weather, natural conditions and disasters including impacts from climate change (discussed above); 

Acts of sabotage, terrorism or other malicious attacks. Damage to our facilities due to deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects; 

Equipment and processes. Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations; 

Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and natural gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver utility services and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered; 

Natural gas supply for generation and distribution. Our regulated utilities and non-regulated entities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, sabotage, cyber-attacks and environmental regulations; 

Replacement power. The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations; 

Governmental permits. The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operate and our results of operations; 

26 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Operational limitations. Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations; 

Increased costs. Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations, unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems, and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations; 

Supply chain challenges (discussed above); 

Workforce capabilities and labor relations (discussed above); and 

Public opposition. Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses. 

Any of these risks described above could damage our reputation and public confidence. These risks could also cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments. 
 
 Our operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in customer usage, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service territories, weather conditions, and responses to price increases and technological improvements. 
 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon: 
 Fluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service territories. Customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as adverse economic factors in our service territories, including recession, inflation, workforce reductions, stagnant wage growth, changing levels of support from state and local government for economic development, business closings, and reductions in the level of business investment. Our utility businesses are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. Any economic downturn, inflation, disruption of financial markets, or reduced incentives by state government for economic development could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products or services. These risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. We could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills. 

Weather conditions. Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively. Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues, income and cash flows when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation. Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our financial operating results, including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 

Our customers' focus on energy conservation. Customer growth and usage may be impacted by the voluntary reduction in consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, electrification initiatives that could negatively impact the demand for natural gas, economic conditions (i.e., inflation, recession) impacting customers disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies. Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers. If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us could decline. Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. 

Each of these factors described above could materially affect demand for electricity and natural gas which would impact our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.

 If macroeconomic or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our strategic business plan, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 
 We had approximately 1.3 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. If we make changes in our strategic business plan and growth strategy, or if macroeconomic or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance, changes in macroeconomic conditions including recession, inflation and interest rates, changes in our regulatory environment, industry-specific market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of either or both of our operating segments, which may result in an impairment charge. See additional information in Critical Accounting Estimates under Item 7 , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics could negatively affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 We are subject to the impacts of widespread public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including, but not limited to, impacts on the global, national or local economies, capital and credit markets, our workforce, customers and suppliers. There is no assurance that our businesses will be able to operate without material adverse impacts depending on the nature of the public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic. The ultimate severity, duration and impact of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics cannot be predicted. Additionally, there is no assurance that vaccines, or other treatments, are or will be widely available or effective, or that the public will be willing to participate, in an effort to contain the spread of disease. Actions taken in response to such crises by federal, state and local government or regulatory agencies may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISKS 
 
 A sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets. 
 
 Our senior unsecured debt rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our investment grade credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs which may not be recoverable through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy. 
 
 Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, general macroeconomic conditions which may drive changes in interest rates and cause volatility in our stock price, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies and volatility in commodity prices. 
 
 In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.

Our use of derivative financial instruments as hedges against commodity prices and financial market risks could result in material financial losses. 
 
 We use various financial and physical derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP may not consistently match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged. For Black Hills Energy Services under the Choice Gas Program, and in certain instances within our regulated Utilities where unrealized and realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are not approved for regulatory accounting treatment, fluctuating commodity prices may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment. 
 
 To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. 
 
 Additionally, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet these requirements, this could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes or may require us to increase our level of debt. Further, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability. 
 
 We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries. Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries. 
 
 As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds. 
 
 There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends to the holding company because these subsidiaries depend on future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions to fund such dividends. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain insurance coverage, and the coverage we currently have may not apply or may be insufficient to cover a significant loss. 
 
 Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting the insurance industry and the financial condition of insurers. Additionally, insurance providers could deny coverage or decline to extend coverage under the same or similar terms that are presently available to us. A loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results. The coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss, or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which we may be subject, including liability and losses associated with wildfires, natural gas and storage field explosions, cyber-security breaches, environmental hazards and natural disasters. 
 
 Market performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 
 Assumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information

 Costs associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly. 
 
 The costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Significant regulatory developments have required, and likely will continue to require, changes to our current employee benefit plans and supporting administrative processes. Our electric and natural gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates, we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, however, there is no assurance that the utility commissions will allow recovery of these increased costs. The rising employee benefit costs, or inadequate recovery of such costs, may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.

 Executive Summary 
 
 We are a customer-focused energy solutions provider with a mission of Improving Life with Energy for more than 1.3 million customers and 800+ communities we serve. Our vision to be the Energy Partner of Choice directs our strategy to invest in the safety, sustainability and growth of our eight-state service territory, including Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming, and to meet our essential objective of providing safe, reliable and cost-effective electricity and natural gas. 
 
 We conduct our business operations through two operating segments: Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities. Certain unallocated corporate expenses that support our operating segments are presented as Corporate and Other. We conduct our utility operations under the name Black Hills Energy predominantly in rural areas of the Rocky Mountains and Midwestern states. We consider ourself a domestic electric and natural gas utility company. 
 
 We have provided energy and served customers for 139 years, since the 1883 gold rush days in Deadwood, South Dakota. Throughout our history, the common thread that unites the past to the present is our commitment to serve our customers and communities. By being responsive and service focused, we can help our customers and communities thrive while meeting rapidly changing customer expectations. 
 
 A critical component of our strategy involves sustainable operations and supporting the Energy Transition. How we operate our company for the social good has never been more important. We are committed to cleaner energy and a low carbon future, integrating the Energy Transition and more renewable energy into our overall strategy and decision making. In addition, we are committed to a more sustainable future by better managing our impacts to the planet, whether that is water usage, recycling, biodiversity, or other important measures, and remaining focused on our human capital through diversity and inclusion. 
 
 Our emphasis is on consistently outperforming utility industry averages in key safety metrics; modernizing utility infrastructure; transforming the customer experience; growing our electric and natural gas customer load; and pursuing operating efficiencies. These areas of focus will present the company with significant investment needs as we harden our infrastructure systems, meet customer growth and fulfill customer expectations for cleaner energy services. It will also allow us to better understand our customer and community needs while providing more intuitive and cost-effective solutions.

 Key Elements of our Business Strategy 
 
 Modernize and operate utility infrastructure to provide customers with safe, reliable, cost-effective electric and natural gas service. Our utilities own and operate large electric and natural gas infrastructure systems with a geographic footprint that spans nearly 1,600 miles. Our Electric Utilities own and operate 1,482 MW of generation capacity and 9,024 miles of transmission and distribution lines and our Gas Utilities own and operate approximately 47,000 miles of natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. 
 
 A key strategic focus is to modernize and harden our utility infrastructure to meet customers and communities varied energy needs, ensure the continued delivery of safe, reliable and cost-effective energy and reduce GHG emissions intensity. In addition, we invest in the expansion, capacity and integrity of our systems to meet customer growth. 
 
 We rigorously comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations and strive to consistently meet industry best practice standards. A key component of our modernization effort is the development of programs by our Electric and Gas Utilities to systematically and proactively replace aging infrastructure on a system-wide basis. 
 
 To meet our electric customers continued expectations of high levels of reliability, a key strength of the Company, our Electric Utilities utilize an integrity program to ensure the timely repair and replacement of aging infrastructure. In alignment with this program, in November 2021, Wyoming Electric announced its Ready Wyoming electric transmission expansion initiative. The 260-mile, multi-phase transmission expansion project will provide customers long-term price stability and greater flexibility as power markets develop in the Western States. On October 11, 2022, the WPSC approved a CPCN submitted by Wyoming Electric to construct the transmission expansion project. Construction of the project is expected to take place in multiple phases or segments from 2023 through 2025 and will interconnect South Dakota Electric s and Wyoming Electric s transmission systems. 
 
 Our Gas Utilities utilize a programmatic approach to system-wide pipeline replacement, particularly in high consequence areas. Under the programmatic approach, obsolete, at-risk and vintage materials are replaced in a proactive and systematic time frame. We have removed all cast- and wrought-iron from our natural gas transmission and distribution systems and continue to replace aging infrastructure through programs that prioritize safety and reliability for our customers. Our Gas Utilities are authorized to use system safety, integrity and replacement cost recovery mechanisms that provide for customer rate adjustments, between rate reviews, which allow timely recovery of costs incurred in repairing and replacing the gas delivery systems with a return on the investment. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we estimate our five-year capital investment to be approximately 3.5 billion, with most of that investment targeted toward upgrading existing utility infrastructure supporting customer and community growth needs, and complying with safety requirements. Our actual 2022 and forecasted capital expenditures for the next five years from 2023 through 2027 are as follows (in millions). Minor differences may result due to rounding.

Efficiently plan, construct and operate power generation facilities to serve our Electric Utilities. We best serve customers and communities when generation is vertically integrated into our Electric Utilities. This business model remains a core strength and strategy today as we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to supply cost-effective electricity to our customers. These generation assets can be rate-based or non-regulated assets within our Electric Utilities segment. However, we believe that generation assets that are rate-based provide long-term benefits to customers. 
 
 Our power production strategy focuses on low-cost construction and efficient operation of our generating facilities. Our low power production costs result from a variety of factors including low fuel costs (operations located near energy hubs), efficiency in converting fuel into energy and low per unit operating and maintenance costs. In addition, we operate our plants with high levels of Availability as compared to industry benchmarks.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Rate Base Generation: We continue to believe that customers are best served when the power generation facilities are owned and rate-based by our Electric Utilities. Rate-based generation assets offer several advantages for customers and shareholders, including: 
 
 When generating assets are included in the utility rate base and reviewed and approved by government authorities, customer rates are more stable and predictable, and typically less expensive in the long run; especially when compared to power otherwise purchased from the open market through wholesale contracts or PPAs that are periodically re-priced to reflect current and varying market conditions; 

Regulators participate in a planning process where long-term investments are designed to match long-term energy demand; 

The lower-risk profile of rate-based generation assets contributes to stronger credit ratings which, in turn, can benefit both customers and investors by lowering the cost of capital; and 

Investors are provided a long-term and stable return on their investment. 

Integrated Generation: Our Electric Utilities segment also includes a power generation business that owns non-regulated generating facilities that are contracted through long-term power purchase agreements with our electric utilities. Our power generation business has an experienced staff with significant expertise in planning, building and operating power plants. This team also provides shared services to our Electric Utilities generation facilities, resulting in efficient management of all of the Company s generation assets. Our power generation business competitively bids for energy and capacity through requests for proposals by our Electric Utilities for energy resources necessary to serve customers. This business can bid competitively due to construction expertise, fuel supply advantages and by co-locating new plants at our existing Electric Utilities energy complexes, reducing infrastructure and operating costs. All power plants within this business, except Northern Iowa Windpower, are contracted to our Electric Utilities under long-term contracts and are located at our utility-generating complexes, including Busch Ranch, Pueblo Airport Generation, and the Gillette, Wyoming energy complex, and are physically integrated into our Electric Utilities operations. 
 
 Generation Fuel Supply: Our generating facilities are strategically located close to energy hubs that help reduce fuel supply costs. Our Colorado and Wyoming gas-fired generating facilities are located close to major natural gas energy hubs that provide trading liquidity and transparent pricing. Due to their location in the resource rich areas of Colorado and Wyoming, natural gas supply to fuel our gas-fired generation can be sourced at competitive prices. Our coal-fired power plants, all located at the Gillette energy complex in northeastern Wyoming, are supplied by our adjacent coal mine. We operate and own majority interests in four of the five power plants and own 20 of the fifth power plant. Our coal mine provides approximately 3.7 million tons of low-sulfur coal directly to these power plants via a conveyor belt system, minimizing transportation costs. The fuel can be delivered to our adjacent power plants at very cost competitive prices (i.e., 1.09 per MMBtu for year ended December 31, 2022) when compared to alternatives. Nearly all the mine s production is sold to these on-site generation facilities under long-term supply contracts. Approximately one-half of our production is sold under cost-plus contracts with affiliates. A small portion of the mine s production is sold to off-site industrial customers and delivered by truck. 
 
 Supporting the Energy Transition by proactively integrating alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating customer rate impacts. In November 2020, we announced clean energy goals to reduce GHG emissions intensity for our Electric Utilities by 40 by 2030 and 70 by 2040 and achieve GHG reductions of 50 by 2035 for our Gas Utilities. Our goals are compared to a 2005 baseline. Electric Utility goals include Scope 1 emissions from electric utility generating units and Scope 3 emissions from purchased power for sales. Our Gas Utilities goal includes Scope 1 emissions from distribution system main and service lines. On August 31, 2022, we announced a new Net Zero by 2035 target for our Gas Utilities, which doubles the previous target of a 50 reduction by 2035 and expands the scope of the goal to all Scope 1 sources of methane emissions on our distribution system. Net Zero will be achieved through pipeline material and main replacements, advanced leak detection, third-party damage reduction, expanding the use of RNG and hydrogen, and utilizing carbon credit offsets. 
 
 Since 2005, we have reduced GHG emissions intensity from our Gas Utilities distribution system mains and services by more than 33 and achieved a one-third reduction from our Electric Utilities (a nearly 10 reduction since announcing our goal in 2020 for our Electric Utilities). We have plans in place today, without reliance on future technologies, to achieve our corporate climate goals calling for a 40 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity from our electric utility operations by 2030 and 70 by 2040. Additionally, our Electric Utilities have reduced nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 75 since 2005. Colorado Electric has achieved a nearly 50 reduction in GHG emissions since 2005 and is on track to reach the State of Colorado s 80 carbon reduction goal by 2030. Our goals are based on prudent and proven solutions to reduce our emissions while minimizing cost impacts to our customers. This keeps our customers at the forefront of our decision-making, which is central to our values.

 More of our customers, particularly our larger customers, are demanding cleaner sources of energy to meet their sustainability goals. In addition, there is more interest from consumers, regulators and legislators to increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources. To support this interest: 
 
 We created the Renewable Ready program for South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric customers. In support of this program, we created and received approvals for new, voluntary renewable energy tariffs to serve certain commercial, industrial and governmental customer requests for renewable energy resources. To meet the renewable energy commitments under the new tariffs, in November 2020, we completed construction and placed into service the Corriedale wind project, a 52.5 MW wind energy project near Cheyenne, Wyoming. 

In June 2021, South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric submitted an IRP to the SDPUC and WPSC. The IRP outlines a range of options for the two electric utilities over a 20-year planning horizon to meet long-term forecasted energy needs while strengthening reliability and resiliency of the grid. The analysis focused on the least-cost resource needs to best meet customers future peak energy needs while maintaining system flexibility and achieving the Company s generation emissions reduction goals. The IRP s preferred options for South Dakota Electric in the near-term planning period through 2026 are the addition of 100 MW of renewable generation, the conversion of Neil Simpson II to natural gas in 2025 and consideration of up to 10 MW of battery storage. 

On January 13, 2023, Colorado Electric submitted a unanimous settlement for its Clean Energy Plan filed May 25, 2022, with the CPUC. If approved, the plan would add approximately 400 MW of new clean energy resources needed to reduce carbon emissions 80 by 2030. A final decision from the CPUC is expected in the first quarter of 2023. 

Many states have enacted, and others are considering, mandatory renewable energy standards, requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy generation. In addition, some states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting GHG emission reduction targets. Federal legislation for renewable energy standards and GHG emission reductions has been considered and may be implemented in the future. Mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of GHG emissions will likely drive the need for significant investment in our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities segments. These mandates will also likely increase prices for electricity and/or natural gas for our utility customers. As a regulated utility, we are responsible for providing safe, reliable and cost-effective sources of energy to our customers. Accordingly, we employ a customer-focused strategy for complying with standards and regulations that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations and administrative and legislative mandates. We attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply, while seeking to minimize the magnitude and frequency of rate increases for our utility customers. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 
 The IRA, signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, features 370 billion in spending and tax incentives on clean energy provisions. Most notably, the IRA includes provisions that extend and expand the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar; include energy storage, EVs, RNG, and carbon capture and sequestration; and allow for the transferability of clean energy tax credits on existing and qualifying new facilities. We see the IRA as generally supportive of our Energy Transition strategy and as having the potential to drive increased value for our customers and shareholders. We are still evaluating the impacts of the IRA provisions on our future capital projects. 
 
 Explore opportunities as an energy solutions provider. Another strategic initiative is to grow our business through creative energy solutions with new customers and partnerships. We see value creation by recruiting new customers and expanding existing partnerships with data centers and blockchain opportunities; exploring energy markets such as RTOs; and expanding our transmission capabilities. A few recent examples of our initiatives to grow our business through creative solutions include: 
 
 In 2022, Wyoming Electric entered into two new PPAs with third parties to purchase up to 106 MW of wind energy and up to 150 MW of solar energy, upon construction of new renewable generation facilities (to be owned by third parties) which are expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The renewable energy from these PPAs will be used to serve our expanding partnerships with data centers. 

We have supported enabling legislation in Wyoming for the growing blockchain businesses while implementing our own BCIS Tariff to serve these customers. In June 2022, Wyoming Electric completed its first agreement, a five-year agreement to deliver up to 45 MW with an option to expand service up to 75 MW to a new customer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, under this Tariff. Energy will be sourced through the electric energy market and delivered through our Electric Utilities infrastructure. Under the agreement, the customer will be responsible for costs of service, and the load will be interruptible to prioritize the needs of Wyoming Electric s existing retail customers.

 During the first quarter of 2022, Colorado Electric agreed to join SPP s WEIS Market. On September 26, 2022, South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric also agreed to join the WEIS Market. South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric will join Colorado Electric in integrating into the WEIS Market in April 2023 and expects to continue studying long-term solutions for joining or developing an organized wholesale market. The expansion allows the utilities to participate in a real-time market. 

Additionally, we are pursuing two important initiatives in the form of sustainable energy solutions for electric vehicles and RNG. These two programs support our near-term sustainable strategy and contribute to the achievement of our aspirational greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. 
 
 Electric Vehicles : We expect EV market share to increase over the next one to three years, commensurate with a significant uptick in vehicle range and product offerings and marked decrease in EV purchase prices. In addition to future load growth opportunities, we are investigating behind-the-meter solutions for customers. In January 2022, the CPUC approved a transportation electrification plan for Colorado Electric including the implementation of EV and charger rebates and EV rates. 

Renewable Natural Gas : In 2021, we developed a voluntary RNG and carbon offset program to help our residential and small business natural gas customers offset up to 100 or more of the emissions associated with their own natural gas usage. In 2022, we filed for approval to launch these programs in three of our states, receiving regulatory approval for the program from both the KCC and the NPSC in Q4 2022. We intend to begin offering the program to customers in 2023, as well as completing additional regulatory filings with commissions in our other natural gas states. 

Our teams are also evaluating multiple RNG investment opportunities and exploring value generation with our natural gas storage assets. We also continue to expand our RNG interconnections, with six projects actively injecting RNG into our natural gas system. In 2022, we created a new non-regulated business, BHERR, which will drive new growth by investing capital into infrastructure assets that provide a pathway for RNG to enter the market. BHERR builds on our expertise and experience in both RNG and natural gas asset operations, and aligns with market demand and the path to a cleaner energy future. 
 
 Execute disciplined capital allocation and explore small strategic opportunities. We are planning a disciplined capital investment program of approximately 600 million during the next year to improve our cash flows and reduce our debt to total capitalization ratio. By carefully managing capital, we plan to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity. With this goal in mind, we will continue to evaluate smaller scale acquisitions of private utility infrastructure systems and small municipal systems that can be easily incorporated into our existing utility systems. 
 
 Deliver a competitive total return to investors and maintain an investment grade credit rating. We are proud of our track record of annual dividend increases for shareholders. 2022 represented our 52nd consecutive year of increasing dividends. In January 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.625 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of 2.50 per share. We intend to continue our record of annual dividend increases with a targeted dividend payout ratio of 55 to 65 of net income. 
 
 We require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or acquire strategic assets that support prudent and earnings-accretive business growth. We have demonstrated our ability to cost-effectively access the debt and equity markets, while maintaining our investment-grade issuer credit rating.

 Recent Developments 
 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 We are monitoring adverse macroeconomic trends including potential recession, inflationary pressures on the prices of commodities, materials, outside services and employee costs; supply chain constraints; rising interest rates and a competitive and tight labor market. To date, we have experienced moderate net impacts from these trends . However, if current macroeconomic conditions continue or deteriorate in 2023, adverse impacts to our businesses may be magnified. 
 Higher commodity energy costs continue to have an effect on customer bills and deferred energy costs. Our utilities have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to pass prudently incurred costs of energy through to the customer, which mitigates our exposure. Customer billing rates are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in our cost of energy. As a result of increased customer billings, we incurred higher bad debt expense. 
 
 Higher deferred energy costs and rising interest rates have led to increased interest expense and increased short-term variable rate borrowings, which include our Revolving Credit Facility and CP Program. However, the increased interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was limited since 88 of our debt at December 31 , 2022, is fixed rate debt. Rising discount rates and r ecent capital markets volatility had a limited impact to the unfunded status of the BHC Pension Plan when compared to the prior year . 
 
 We are proactively managing increased costs of materials and supply chain disruptions to achieve our forecasted capital investment targets. To support our 2023 capital investment program, we have contracted materials for the majority of our largest forecasted projects. We continue to forecast multi-year key material requirements with suppliers to enhance predictable material availability, challenge vendor price increases to ensure best value and cost transparency and invest in our distribution network to ensure the safety and continuity of our system. We have also evaluated each of our forecasted projects and will prioritize depending on future constraints. Project delays may occur if costs rise significantly or if materials are not available. 
 Inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints have increased our operating expenses, which included higher outside services expenses (i.e., consulting and contractor rates), materials expenses and vehicle expenses driven by higher fuel prices. We are faced with increased competition for employee and contractor talent in the current labor market. To date, we have seen a limited net increase in total employee costs due to increased employee and contractor costs related to attraction and retention of talent mostly offset by workforce attrition.

2022 Compared to 2021 
 
 The variance to the prior year included the following: 
 
 Electric Utilities operating income increased 12 million primarily due to increased rider revenues, prior year impacts related to the Wygen I unplanned outage and Colorado Electric s TCJA-related bill credits to customers, increased transmission services revenue and off-system excess energy sales partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower pricing on the new Wygen I PPA; 

Gas Utilities operating income increased 33 million primarily due to new rates and rider recovery, favorable weather, carrying costs on our Winter Storm Uri regulatory asset, prior year Black Hills Energy Services Winter Storm Uri costs, customer growth partially offset by higher operating expenses; 

Corporate and Other expenses decreased 1.2 million primarily due to an allocation of a 2020 employee cost true-up in the first quarter of 2021, which was offset in our business segments; 

Interest expense increased 8.6 million due to higher interest rates on higher short-term debt balances; 

Income tax expense increased 18 million driven by higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax benefits from Colorado Electric and Nebraska Gas TCJA-related bill credits and decreased flow-through tax benefits driven by prior year repairs and gain deferral partially offset by tax benefits from various state tax rate changes; and 

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased 2.1 million due to lower net income from Black Hills Colorado IPP primarily driven by lower fired-engine hours and a planned outage.

 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, Electric and Gas Utility margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Electric and Gas Utility margin (revenue less cost of sales) is a non-GAAP financial measure due to the exclusion of operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and property and production taxes from the measure. 
 
 Electric Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and purchased power. Gas Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of natural gas sold. Our Electric and Gas Utility margin is impacted by the fluctuations in power and natural gas purchases and other fuel supply costs. However, while these fluctuating costs impact Electric and Gas Utility margin as a percentage of revenue, they only impact total Electric and Gas Utility margin if the costs cannot be passed through to our customers. 
 
 Our Electric and Gas Utility margin measure may not be comparable to other companies Electric and Gas Utility margin measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.

2022 Compared to 2021 
 
 Electric Utility margin increased over the prior year as a result of: 

(in millions) 

New rates and rider recovery

Other 
 
 1.4 

39.6 

(a) In February 2021, Colorado Electric delivered TCJA-related bill credits to its customers. These bill credits were offset by a reduction in income tax expense and resulted in a minimal impact to Net income. 

(b) Primarily driven by favorable market pricing on contracts and off-system sales. 

Operations and maintenance expense increased due to 10.3 million of higher generation-related expenses primarily due to higher fuel and materials costs and increased royalties on higher mining revenues, 4.5 million of higher outside services expenses primarily driven by higher contractor and consultant rates, 3.4 million of increased property taxes due to an expiration of an abatement and a higher asset base driven by recent capital expenditures, 3.4 million of higher cloud computing licensing costs, and 1.1 million of increased bad debt expense primarily attributable to higher customer billings. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to higher asset base driven by prior and current year capital expenditures.

(a) In certain jurisdictions, we have commission approval to recover carrying costs on Winter Storm Uri regulatory assets which offset increased interest expense. Additionally, the carrying costs accrued during the year ended December 31, 2022 included a one-time, 10.3 million true-up to reflect commission authorized rates. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. 

(b) Black Hills Energy Services offers fixed contract pricing for non-regulated gas supply services to our regulated natural gas customers. The increased cost of natural gas sold during Winter Storm Uri was not recoverable through a regulatory mechanism. 

Operations and maintenance expense increased due to 11.6 million of higher outside services and materials expenses driven primarily by higher contractor and consultant fees, 5.0 million of increased bad debt expense primarily attributable to higher customer billings, 4.6 million of higher cloud computing licensing costs, 3.2 million of higher property taxes driven by a higher asset base on recent capital expenditures, 2.1 million of higher vehicle expense driven by higher fuel costs, 1.6 million of higher employee-related expenses and 1.2 million increased travel and training expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a higher asset base driven by prior and current year capital expenditures.

 Interest expense, net 
 
 The increase in Interest expense, net was due to higher interest rates on higher short-term debt balances. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), net was comparable to the prior year primarily due to lower costs for our non-qualified benefit plans which were driven by market performance mostly offset by a prior year recognition of death benefits from Company-owned life insurance and higher non-service pension costs primarily driven by a higher discount rate. 
 
 Income tax benefit (expense) 
 
 Income tax expense increased due to higher pre-tax income and a higher effective tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was 8.5 compared to 2.8 in 2021. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to 10 million of prior year tax benefits from Colorado Electric TCJA-related bill credits to customers (which were offset by reduced revenue) and 5.4 million decreased flow-through tax benefits driven by prior year repairs and gain deferral partially offset by 4.0 million of current year tax benefits from various state rate changes, and 1.8 million of increased tax benefits from federal PTCs driven by a current year PTC rate increase (inflation adjustment). See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Our company requires significant cash to support and grow our businesses. Our primary sources of cash are generated from our operating activities, five-year Revolving Credit Facility, CP Program, ATM and ability to access the public and private capital markets through debt and equity securities offerings when necessary. This cash is used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, pension funding, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of debt obligations and redemption of outstanding debt and equity securities when required or financially appropriate. 
 
 We experience significant cash requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption, during periods of high natural gas prices, and during the construction season which typically peaks in spring and summer. 
 
 We believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flows, existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt and equity financings, taken in their entirety, provide sufficient capital resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements, regulatory liabilities, debt maturities, anticipated dividends, and anticipated capital expenditures discussed in this section.

 47 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Net inflows from changes in certain operating assets and liabilities were 626 million higher than prior year, primarily attributable to: 
 
 Cash inflows increased by approximately 728 million primarily as a result of changes in our regulatory assets and liabilities primarily driven by prior year incremental fuel, purchased power and natural gas costs due to Winter Storm Uri and current year recovery of a portion of Winter Storm Uri incremental and carrying costs from customers; 

Cash outflows increased by approximately 181 million primarily as a result of changes in accounts receivable and other current assets driven by increased revenue due to higher commodity prices and colder weather and increased purchases of natural gas in storage; 

Cash inflows increased by approximately 79 million as a result of changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities driven by payment timing related to natural gas and power purchases and other working capital requirements; 

Cash outflows increased 15.2 million from other operating activities primarily due to higher cloud computing licensing costs, increased payments on settled commodity derivatives and higher preliminary survey charges.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Short-term Debt 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility and CP Program 
 
 We have a 750 million Revolving Credit Facility that matures on July 19, 2026, with two one-year extension options (subject to consent from lenders). This facility includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase total commitments up to 1.0 billion with the consent of the administrative agent, the issuing agents and each bank increasing or providing a new commitment. We also have a 750 million, unsecured CP Program that is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the CP Program, either individually or in the aggregate, cannot exceed 750 million. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to, or would result after, paying a dividend. Although these contractual restrictions exist, we do not anticipate triggering any default measures or restrictions. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility contains cross-default provisions that could result in a default under such agreements if BHC or its material subsidiaries failed to 1) make timely payments of debt obligations; or 2) triggered other default provisions under any debt agreement totaling, in the aggregate principal amount of 50 million or more that permit the acceleration of debt maturities or mandatory debt prepayment. 
 
 See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our Revolving Credit Facility and CP Program. 
 
 Utility Money Pool 
 
 As a utility holding company, we are required to establish a cash management program to address lending and borrowing activities between our utilities and the Company. We have established utility money pool agreements which address these requirements. These agreements are on file with the FERC and appropriate state regulators. Under the utility money pool agreements, our utilities may, at their option, borrow and extend short-term loans to our other utilities at market-based rates. While the utility money pool may borrow funds from the Company (as ultimate parent company), the money pool arrangement does not allow loans from our utility subsidiaries to the Company (as ultimate parent company) or to non-regulated affiliates. 
 
 Long-term Debt 
 
 For information on our long-term debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Covenant Requirements 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility and Wyoming Electric s financing agreements contain covenant requirements. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022. See additional information in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Equity 
 
 Shelf Registration 
 
 We have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue, from time to time, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants and other securities. Although the shelf registration statement does not limit our issuance capacity, our ability to issue securities is limited to the authority granted by our Board of Directors, certain covenants in our financing arrangements and restrictions imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities. The shelf registration expires in August 2023. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100 million shares of common stock and 25 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 66 million shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 
 
 ATM 
 
 Our ATM allows us to sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to 400 million. The shares may be offered from time to time pursuant to a sales agreement dated August 4, 2020. Shares of common stock are offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. 
 
 For additional information regarding equity, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Future Financing Plans 
 
 We will continue to assess debt and equity needs to support our capital investment plans and other strategic objectives. We plan to fund our capital plan and strategic objectives by using cash generated from operating activities and various financing alternatives, which could include our Revolving Credit Facility, our CP Program, the issuance of common stock under our ATM program or in an opportunistic block trade. In the first quarter of 2023, we plan to re-finance a portion of our short-term borrowings into long-term debt. We also plan to re-finance our 525 million, 4.25 , senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2023, at or before maturity date. Additionally, we plan to renew our ATM and shelf registration at or before shelf expiration in August 2023. 
 
 CREDIT RATINGS 
 
 Financing for operational needs and capital expenditure requirements, not satisfied by operating cash flows, depends upon the cost and availability of external funds through both short and long-term financing. In order to operate and grow our business, we need to consistently maintain the ability to raise capital on favorable terms. Access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic and capital market conditions, regulatory authorizations and policies, the Company s credit ratings, cash flows from routine operations and the credit ratings of counterparties. After assessing the current operating performance, liquidity and credit ratings of the Company, management believes that the Company will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings. We note that credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 The following table represents the credit ratings, outlook and risk profile of BHC at December 31, 2022:

(b) On December 20, 2022, Moody's reported our Baa2 rating and maintained a Stable outlook. 

(c) On October 6, 2022, Fitch reported BBB+ rating and maintained a Stable outlook. 

Certain fees and interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility are based on our credit ratings at all three rating agencies. If all of our ratings are at the same level, or if two of our ratings are the same level and one differs, these fees and interest rates will be based on the ratings that are at the same level. If all of our ratings are at different levels, these fees and interest rates will be based on the middle level. Currently, our Fitch and S P ratings are at the same level, and our Moody s rating is one level below. Therefore, if Fitch or S P downgrades our senior unsecured debt, we will be required to pay higher fees and interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility.

We do not have any trigger events (i.e. an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness, an increase in interest costs, or the posting of additional cash collateral) tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings. 

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures are a substantial portion of our cash requirements each year and we continue to forecast a robust capital expenditure program during the next five years. See above in Key Elements of our Business Strategy for forecasted capital expenditure requirements. A significant portion of our capital expenditures are for safety, reliability and integrity of our system and is included in utility rate base and eligible for recovery from our utility customers with regulatory approval. Those capital expenditures also earn a rate of return authorized by the commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Our historical capital expenditures by reportable segment are shown in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Repayments of Indebtedness 
 
 For information relating to repayments of our short- and long-term debt and associated interest payments, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 
 
 We have unconditional purchase obligations which include the energy and capacity costs associated with our PPAs, transmission services agreements, and natural gas capacity, transportation and storage agreements. Additionally, our Gas Utilities have commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to various forward natural gas price curves. For additional information. see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Defined Benefit Pension Plan 
 
 We have one defined benefit pension plan, the Black Hills Retirement Plan (Pension Plan). The unfunded status of the Pension Plan is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. The unfunded status of the Pension Plan is 35 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 20 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the unfunded status of the Pension Plan was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate. We do not have required contributions and we do not expect to make contributions to our Pension Plan in 2023. See further information in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 
 Future cash dividends, if any, will be dependent on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated and approved by our Board of Directors. 
 
 Additionally, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect future cash dividends paid. Federal law places limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company structure to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants. See additional information in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 On January 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.625 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of 2.50 per share. The table below provides our dividends paid (in thousands), dividend payout ratio and dividends paid per share for the three years ended December 31:

Our three-year compound annualized dividend growth rate was 5.5 . 
 
 Collateral Requirements 
 
 Our Utilities maintain wholesale commodity contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas which have performance assurance provisions that allow the counterparty to require collateral postings under certain conditions, including when requested on a reasonable basis due to a deterioration in our financial condition or nonperformance. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings, such as a downgrade to a level below investment grade, could result in counterparties requiring collateral postings under such adequate assurance provisions. The amount of credit support that we may be required to provide at any point in the future is dependent on the amount of the initial transaction, changes in the market price, open positions and the amounts owed by or to the counterparty. At December 31, 2022, we had sufficient liquidity to cover collateral that could be required to be posted under these contracts. The cash collateral we were required to post at December 31, 2022 was not material. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Guarantees 
 
 We provide various guarantees, which represent off-balance sheet commitments, supporting certain of our subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. For more information on these guarantees, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in application. There are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available GAAP alternatives. We are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and related impacts on our critical accounting estimates including, but not limited to, collectability of customer receivables, recoverability of regulatory assets, impairment risk of goodwill and long-lived assets, and contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. 
 
 The following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with Note 1 , Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Regulation 
 
 Our regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory commissions based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. 
 
 Management continually assesses the probability of future recoveries associated with regulatory assets and future obligations associated with regulatory liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. As a result, we believe that the accounting prescribed under rate-based regulation remains appropriate and our regulatory assets are probable of recovery in current rates or in future rate proceedings. 
 
 To some degree, each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) outside of a base rate review. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers, and a state regulatory commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had total regulatory assets of 653 million and 797 million, respectively, and total regulatory liabilities of 519 million and 503 million, respectively. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is as of October 1, which aligns with our financial planning process. 
 
 Accounting standards for testing goodwill for impairment require the application of either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Under either the qualitative or quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 
 52 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit. We have determined that the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are our operating segments, or components of an operating segment, that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which the CODM regularly reviews the operating results. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted future cash flows, and a market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. These valuations require significant judgments, including, but not limited to: 1) estimates of future cash flows, based on our internal five-year business plans and adjusted as appropriate for our view of market participant assumptions, with long range cash flows estimated using a terminal value calculation; 2) estimates of long-term growth rates for our businesses; 3) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate; and 4) the utilization of market information such as recent sales transactions for comparable assets within the utility and energy industries. Varying by reporting unit, weighted average cost of capital in the range of 6.9 to 7.0 and long-term growth rate projections of 1.75 were utilized in the goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2022. Although 1.75 was used for a long-term growth rate projection, the short-term projected growth rate is higher with planned recovery of capital investments through rider mechanisms and rate reviews. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using multiples derived from comparable sales transactions and enterprise value to EBITDA for comparative peer companies for each respective reporting unit. These multiples are applied to operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value. In addition, we add a reasonable control premium when calculating fair value utilizing the peer multiples, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale in an orderly transaction between market participants. 
 
 At October 1, 2022, fair value exceeded the carrying value at all reporting units. However, the Gas Utilities reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 and could be at risk for impairment if adverse macroeconomic conditions persist or deteriorate. The decrease in the fair value cushion of the Gas Utilities reporting unit when compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. 
 
 The estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are based on available market information and we believe they are reasonable. However, variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no impairment losses recorded. At December 31, 2022, the fair value exceeded the carrying value at all reporting units. 
 
 See Item 1A - Risk Factors and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns. Each entity records income taxes as if it were a separate taxpayer for both federal and state income tax purposes and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of taxable income or loss. 
 
 The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted income tax rates, to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Such temporary differences are the result of provisions in the income tax law that either require or permit certain items to be reported on the income tax return in a different period than they are reported in the financial statements. 
 
 In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required. If we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made in the period such determination was made. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our activities in the regulated and non-regulated energy sectors expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses. Depending on the activity, we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and credit risk. 
 
 Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of an adverse change in market price, rate or supply. We are exposed, but not limited to, the following market risks: 
 Commodity price risk associated with our retail natural gas services, wholesale electric power marketing activities and fuel procurement for several of our gas-fired generation assets. Market fluctuations may occur due to unpredictable factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, weather (e.g. Winter Storm Uri), geopolitical events, market speculation, recession, inflation, pipeline constraints, and other factors that may impact natural gas and electric energy supply and demand; and 

Interest rate risk associated with future debt, including reduced access to liquidity during periods of extreme capital markets volatility, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Credit risk is associated with financial loss resulting from non-performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty. 
 
 To manage and mitigate these identified risks, we have adopted the Black Hills Corporation Risk Policies and Procedures. The Black Hills Corporation Risk Policies and Procedures have been approved by our Executive Risk Committee. These policies relate to numerous matters including governance, control infrastructure, authorized commodities and trading instruments, prohibited activities and employee conduct. We report any issues or concerns pertaining to the Risk Policies and Procedures to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Executive Risk Committee, which includes senior level executives, meets at least quarterly and as necessary, to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Electric and Gas Utilities 
 
 Our utilities have various provisions that allow them to pass the prudently-incurred cost of energy through to the customer. To the extent energy prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates, adjustments are made on a periodic basis to reflect billed amounts to match the actual energy cost we incurred. In Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming, we have ECA or PCA provisions that adjust electric rates when energy costs are higher or lower than the costs included in our tariffs. In Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming, we have GCA provisions that adjust natural gas rates when our natural gas costs are higher or lower than the energy cost included in our tariffs. These adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state regulatory commissions. If state regulatory commissions decide to discontinue these tariff-based adjustment mechanisms, or there are delays in the timing of recovery under these mechanisms, we may be more exposed to commodity price risk. 
 
 The operations of our utilities, including natural gas sold by our Gas Utilities and natural gas used by our Electric Utilities generation plants or those plants under PPAs where our Electric Utilities must provide the generation fuel (tolling agreements), expose our utility customers to natural gas price volatility. Therefore, as allowed or required by state regulatory commissions, we have entered into commission-approved hedging programs utilizing natural gas futures, options, over-the-counter swaps and basis swaps to reduce our customers underlying exposure to these fluctuations. 
 
 For our regulated Utilities hedging plans, unrealized and realized gains and losses, as well as option premiums and commissions on these transactions are recorded as Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with the state utility commission guidelines. When the related costs are recovered through our rates, the hedging activity is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See additional information in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Wholesale Power 
 
 We periodically have wholesale power purchase and sale contracts used to manage purchased power costs and load requirements associated with serving our electric customers that are considered derivative instruments and do not qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception for derivative accounting. Changes in the fair value of these commodity derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 A potential risk related to wholesale power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of power that exceeds our generating capacity. These potential short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands. To manage such risk, we restrict wholesale off-system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin. 
 54 
 
 Table of Contents 

Black Hills Energy Services 
 
 To support our Choice Gas Program customers, we buy and sell natural gas at competitive prices by managing commodity price risk. As a result of these activities, this area of our business is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks using over-the-counter and exchange traded options and swaps with counterparties in anticipation of forecasted purchases and sales. A portion of our over-the-counter swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with fixed price forward contracts to supply gas to our Choice Gas Program customers. The gain or loss on these designated derivatives is reported in AOCI in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a 10 change in market prices for our derivative instruments would not materially impact pre-tax income, the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities, or OCI. 
 
 See additional commodity risk and derivative information in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Periodically, we have engaged in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates. We have utilized pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with floating rate debt obligations and anticipated debt refinancings. At December 31, 2022, we had no interest rate swaps in place. Further details of past swap agreements are set forth in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 88 of our debt is fixed rate debt, which limits our exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the benchmark rate on our variable rate debt would have increased annual pretax interest expense by approximately 4.1 million and 2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8 for further information on cash amounts outstanding under short- and long-term variable rate borrowings. 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans. Declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans. See additional information in Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We have adopted the Black Hills Corporation Credit Policy that establishes guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the Board of Directors. We attempt to mitigate our credit exposure by conducting business primarily with high credit quality entities, setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength, obtaining master netting agreements and mitigating credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees, cash collateral requirements, letters of credit and other security agreements. 
 
 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness, as determined by review of their current credit information. We maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, changes in current market conditions, expected losses and any specific customer collection issue that is identified. Our credit exposure at December 31, 2022 was concentrated primarily among retail utility customers, investment grade companies, cooperative utilities and federal agencies.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO . This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of Black Hills Corporation s financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Black Hills Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Deloitte Touche LLP's report on Black Hills Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Black Hills Corporation 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Black Hills Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company is subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight by state and federal utility commissions (collectively, the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction over the Company s electric rates in Colorado, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming and natural gas rates in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; revenue; operating expenses; and income tax benefit (expense). 
 
 57 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory commissions based on an analysis of the costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated its regulatory assets are probable of recovery in current rates or in future proceedings, there is a risk that the Commissions will not judge all costs to have been prudently incurred or that the rate regulation process in which rates are determined will not always result in rates that produce a full recovery of costs and a reasonable return on invested capital. 
 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, and (2) a refund or future rate reduction to be provided to customers. Given the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 

We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, procedural memorandums, filings made by the Company, and other publicly available information, as appropriate, to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to the Company s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness and for any evidence that might contradict management s assertions. 

We obtained and evaluated an analysis from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or of a future reduction in rates. 

We inspected minutes of the board of directors to identify any evidence that may contradict management s assertions regarding probability of recovery or refunds. We also inquired of management regarding current year rate filings and new regulatory assets or liabilities. 

We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Black Hills Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Black Hills Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Total materials, supplies and fuel 

Materials and supplies represent parts and supplies for business segments. Fuel represents diesel oil and gas used by our Electric Utilities to produce power. Natural gas in storage primarily represents gas purchased for use by our gas customers. All of our Materials, supplies and fuel are recorded using the weighted-average cost method and are valued at the lower-of-cost or net realizable value. The value of our natural gas in storage fluctuates with seasonal volume requirements of our business and the commodity price of natural gas.

We also capitalize interest, when applicable, on undeveloped leasehold costs and certain non-regulated construction projects. In addition, asset retirement costs associated with tangible long-lived regulated utility assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related long-lived regulated utility assets in the period incurred. The amounts capitalized are included in Property, plant and equipment on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also classify our Cushion Gas as Property, plant and equipment. The cost of regulated utility property, plant and equipment retired, or otherwise disposed in the ordinary course of business, less salvage plus retirement costs, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Estimated removal costs related to our regulated properties that do not have legal retirement obligations are reclassified from accumulated depreciation and reflected as regulatory liabilities. Retirement or disposal of all other assets result in gains or losses recognized as a component of operating income. Ordinary repairs and maintenance of property, except as allowed under rate regulations, are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation provisions for property, plant and equipment are generally computed on a straight-line basis based on the applicable estimated service life of the various classes of property. The composite depreciation method is applied to regulated utility property. Capitalized mining costs and coal leases are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on volumes produced and estimated reserves. For certain non-regulated power plant components, depreciation is computed on a unit-of-production methodology based on plant hours run. See Note 5 for additional information. 
 
 Our goodwill impairment analysis includes an income approach and a market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. This analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions, including future growth rates, cash flow projections, operating cost escalation rates, rates of return, a risk-adjusted discount rate, timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings, the cost of debt and equity capital, long-term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies.

Transfers into Level 3, if any, occur when significant inputs used to value the derivative instruments become less observable, such as a significant decrease in the frequency and volume in which the instrument is traded, negatively impacting the availability of observable pricing inputs. Transfers out of Level 3, if any, occur when the significant inputs become more observable, such as when the time between the valuation date and the delivery date of a transaction becomes shorter, positively impacting the availability of observable pricing inputs. Valuation Methodologies for Derivatives The wholesale electric energy and natural gas commodity contracts for our Utilities are valued using the market approach and include forward strip pricing at liquid delivery points, exchange-traded futures, options, basis swaps and over-the-counter swaps and options (Level 2). For exchange-traded futures, options and basis swap assets and liabilities, fair value was derived using broker quotes validated by the exchange settlement pricing for the applicable contract. For over-the-counter instruments, the fair value is obtained by utilizing a nationally recognized service that obtains observable inputs to compute the fair value, which we validate by comparing our valuation with the counterparty. The fair value of these swaps includes a CVA based on the credit spreads of the counterparties when we are in an unrealized gain position or on our own credit spread when we are in an unrealized loss position. Additional information on fair value measurements is included in Notes 10 and 13 . 

Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or OCI, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the expectation the amounts will be returned to customers in future rates, or because the amounts were collected in rates prior to the costs being incurred. 

 Management continually assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders, and historical precedents are considered. As a result, we believe that the accounting prescribed under rate-based regulation remains appropriate and our regulatory assets are probable of recovery in current rates or in future rate proceedings. If changes in the regulatory environment occur, we may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate regulatory assets and liabilities from our balance sheet. Such changes could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See Note 2 for further information.

Regulatory assets represent items we expect to recover from customers through probable future rates. Winter Storm Uri - See discussion below for Winter Storm Uri regulatory asset information. Deferred Energy and Fuel Cost Adjustments - Deferred energy and fuel cost adjustments represent the cost of electricity delivered to our Electric Utilities customers that is either higher or lower than the current rates and will be recovered or refunded in future rates. Deferred energy and fuel cost adjustments are recorded and recovered or amortized as approved by the appropriate state regulatory commission. Our Electric Utilities file periodic quarterly, semi-annual and/or annual filings to recover these costs based on the respective cost mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory commissions. Deferred Gas Cost Adjustment s - Our regulated Gas Utilities have GCA provisions that allow them to pass the cost of gas on to their customers. The GCA is based on forecasts of the upcoming gas costs and recovery or refund of prior under-recovered or over-recovered costs. To the extent that gas costs are under-recovered or over-recovered, they are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively. Our Gas Utilities file periodic monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and/or annual filings to recover these costs based on the respective cost mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory commissions. Gas Price Derivatives - Our regulated Gas Utilities, as allowed or required by state regulatory commissions, have entered into certain exchange-traded natural gas futures and options to reduce our customers underlying exposure to fluctuations in gas prices. Gas price derivatives represent our unrealized positions on our commodity contracts supporting our utilities. Gas price derivatives at December 31, 2022 are hedged over a maximum forward term of . Deferred Taxes on AFUDC - The equity component of AFUDC is considered a permanent difference for tax purposes with the tax benefit being flowed through to customers as prescribed or allowed by regulators. If, based on a regulator s action, it is probable the utility will recover the future increase in taxes payable represented by this flow-through treatment through a rate revenue increase, a regulatory asset is recognized. This regulatory asset is a temporary difference for which a deferred tax liability must be recognized. Accounting standards for income taxes specifically address AFUDC-equity and require a gross-up of such amounts to reflect the revenue requirement associated with a rate-regulated environment. Employee Benefit Plans and Related Deferred Taxes - Employee benefit plans include the unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial loss associated with our defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit plans in regulatory assets rather than in AOCI. In addition, this regulatory asset includes the income tax effect of the adjustment required under accounting for compensation - defined benefit plans, to record the full pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Such income tax effect has been grossed-up to account for the revenue requirement associated with a rate regulated environment. Environmental - Environmental costs associated with certain former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs are first offset by recognition of insurance proceeds and settlements with other third parties. Any remaining cost will be requested for recovery in future rate filings. Recovery for these specific environmental costs has not yet been approved by the applicable state regulatory commission and therefore, the recovery period is unknown at this time. Loss on Reacquired Debt - Loss on reacquired debt is recovered over the remaining life of the original issue or, if refinanced, over the life of the new issue. Deferred Taxes on Flow-Through Accounting - Under flow-through accounting, the income tax effects of certain tax items are reflected in our cost of service for the customer and result in lower utility rates in the year in which the tax benefits are realized. A regulatory asset was established to reflect that future increases in income taxes payable will be recovered from customers as the temporary differences reverse. As a result of this regulatory treatment, we continue to record a tax benefit for costs considered currently deductible for tax purposes but are capitalized for book purposes. Decommissioning Costs - South Dakota Electric and Colorado Electric received approval in 2014 for recovery of the remaining net book values and decommissioning costs of their decommissioned coal plants. In 2018, Arkansas Gas received approval to record Liquefied Natural Gas Plant decommissioning costs as a regulatory asset and received approval in 2020 to begin recovering those costs over . Regulatory liabilities represent items we expect to refund to customers through probable future decreases in rates. Deferred Energy and Gas Costs - Deferred energy and gas costs that have been over-recovered through customer rates and will be returned to customers in future periods. Employee Benefit Plan Costs and Related Deferred Taxes - Employee benefit plans represent the cumulative excess of pension and retiree healthcare costs recovered in rates over pension expense recorded in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits . In addition, this regulatory liability includes the income tax effect of the adjustment required under ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits , to record the full pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Such income tax effect has been grossed-up to account for the revenue requirement associated with a rate regulated environment. Cost of Removal - Cost of removal represents the estimated cumulative net provisions for future removal costs for which there is no legal obligation for removal included in depreciation expense. Excess Deferred Income Taxes - The revaluation of the regulated utilities' deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the passage of the TCJA was recorded as an excess deferred income tax to be refunded to customers primarily using the normalization principles as prescribed in the TCJA. See Note 15 for additional information. Recent Regulatory Activity Winter Storm Uri In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri caused a substantial increase in heating and energy demand and contributed to unforeseeable and unprecedented market prices for natural gas and electricity. As a result, we incurred significant incremental fuel, purchased power and natural gas costs. Our Utilities submitted Winter Storm Uri cost recovery applications in our state jurisdictions seeking to recover million of these incremental costs through separate tracking mechanisms over a weighted-average recovery period of years. In these applications, we sought approval to recover carrying costs. We have received final commission approval for all of our Winter Storm Uri cost recovery applications, which will allow our Utilities to recover incremental fuel, purchased power and natural gas costs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Utilities collected million and million, respectively, of Winter Storm Uri incremental costs and carrying costs from customers. As of December 31, 2022 , we estimate that our remaining Winter Storm Uri regulatory asset has a weighted-average recovery period of years. For years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, million and million, respectively, of carrying costs were accrued and recorded to a regulatory asset. The carrying costs accrued during the year ended December 31, 2022 included a one-time, million true-up recorded in the second quarter to reflect commission authorized rates. TCJA On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from to . As such, the Company remeasured our deferred income taxes at the federal tax rate as of December 31, 2017. In 2018 and 2019, the Company successfully delivered several of these tax benefits from the TCJA to its utility customers. On December 30, 2020, an administrative law judge approved a settlement of Colorado Electric s plan to provide million of TCJA-related bill credits to its customers. The bill credits, which represent a disposition of excess deferred income tax benefits resulting from the TCJA, were delivered to customers in February 2021. On January 26, 2021, the NPSC approved Nebraska Gas s plan to provide million of TCJA-related bill credits to its customers. The bill credits, which represent a disposition of excess deferred income tax benefits resulting from the TCJA, were delivered to customers in June 2021. As part of Kansas Gas 2021 rate review settlement agreement, Kansas Gas will deliver million, or approximately million of TCJA and state tax reform benefits to customers annually, for starting in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Kansas Gas delivered TCJA and state tax reform benefits to customers of million. These Colorado Electric, Kansas Gas and Nebraska Gas tax benefits delivered to customers, which resulted in a reduction in revenue, were offset by a reduction in income tax expense and resulted in a minimal impact to Net income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Arkansas Gas On December 10, 2021, Arkansas Gas filed a rate review with the APSC seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile natural gas pipeline system. On October 10, 2022, the APSC approved a partial settlement agreement with all intervening parties for a general rate increase and authorized a capital structure of equity and debt and a return on equity of . The APSC s decision shifts approximately million of rider revenue to base rates and is expected to generate million of new annual revenue. The APSC also approved a new comprehensive safety and integrity rider which replaces former riders. New rates were effective on October 21, 2022. Wyoming Electric On June 1, 2022, Wyoming Electric filed a rate review with the WPSC seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile electric distribution and -mile electric transmission systems. On January 26, 2023, the WPSC approved a settlement agreement with intervening parties for a general rate increase. The settlement is expected to generate million in new annual revenue with a capital structure of equity and debt and a return on equity of . New rates will be effective on March 1, 2023. The agreement also includes approval of a new rider that will be filed annually to recover transmission investment and expenses. Colorado Gas RMNG Rate Review On October 7, 2022, RMNG filed a rate review with the CPUC seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile natural gas pipeline system. The rate review requests million in new annual revenue based on a future test year with a capital structure of equity and debt and a return on equity of . The rate review also requests a million shift of SSIR revenues to base rates. The request seeks to finalize rates in the third quarter of 2023. Colorado Gas Rate Reviews and SSIR On June 1, 2021, Colorado Gas filed a rate review with the CPUC seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile natural gas pipeline system. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Colorado Gas reached a settlement agreement with the CPUC staff and various intervenors for a general rate increase, which was subsequently approved by an administrative law judge. N ew rates were effective January 1, 2022, and the settlement is expected to generate million of new annual revenue. The new revenue is based on a return on equity of and a capital structure of equity and debt. On September 11, 2020, in accordance with the final Order from the rate review filed on February 1, 2019, Colorado Gas filed a SSIR proposal with the CPUC that would recover safety and integrity focused investments in its system for . On July 6, 2021, Colorado Gas received approval from the CPUC for its SSIR proposal to recover these investments for effective January 1, 2022. The return on SSIR investments will be the current weighted-average cost of long-term debt. Iowa Gas Rate Review On June 1, 2021, Iowa Gas filed a rate review with the IUB seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile natural gas pipeline system. On December 28, 2021, the IUB approved a settlement agreement with all intervening parties for a general rate increase. The settlement shifted million of rider revenue to base rates and is expected to generate million in new annual revenue with a capital structure of equity and debt and a return on equity of . Final rates were enacted on January 1, 2022 and replaced interim rates effective June 11, 2021. Kansas Gas Rate Review On May 7, 2021, Kansas Gas filed a rate review and rider renewal with the KCC seeking recovery of significant infrastructure investments in its -mile natural gas pipeline system. On December 30, 2021, Kansas Gas received approval from the KCC on its Global Settlement agreement with KCC staff and various intervenors for a general rate increase and renewal of its safety and integrity rider. The settlement shifted million of rider revenue to base rates, effective January 1, 2022, and also allowed rider renewal for at least five more years. South Dakota Electric FERC Formula Rate The annual rate determination process is governed by the FERC formula rate protocols established in the filed FERC joint-access transmission tariff. Effective January 1, 2022, the annual revenue requirement for the FERC Transmission Formula Rate was million and included estimated weighted average capital additions of million for 2021 and 2022 combined. Black Hills Wyoming and Wyoming Electric Wygen I FERC Filing On October 15, 2020, the FERC approved a settlement agreement that represents a resolution of all issues in the joint application filed by Wyoming Electric and Black Hills Wyoming on August 2, 2019 for approval of a new MW PPA. Under the terms of the settlement, Wyoming Electric will continue to receive MW of capacity and energy from the Wygen I power plant. The new agreement commenced on January 1, 2022, replaced the existing PPA and will expire after .

Environmental Matters We are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations which affect future planning and existing operations. Laws and regulations can result in increased capital expenditures, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation and monitoring obligations. Due to the environmental issues discussed below, we may be required to modify, curtail, replace or cease operating certain facilities or operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies. Reclamation Liability For our Pueblo Airport Generation site, we posted a bond of million with the State of Colorado to cover the costs of remediation for a waste water containment pond permitted to provide wastewater storage and processing for this zero-discharge facility. The reclamation liability is recorded at the present value of the estimated future cost to reclaim the land. Under our land leases for our wind generation facilities, we are required to reclaim land where we have placed wind turbines. The reclamation liabilities are recorded at the present value of the estimated future cost to reclaim the land. Under its mining permit, WRDC is required to reclaim all land where it has mined reserves. The reclamation liability is recorded at the present value of the estimated future cost to reclaim the land. See Note 7 for additional information. Manufactured Gas Processing In 20 08, we acquired whole and partial liabilities for former manufactured gas processing sites in Nebraska and Iowa, which were previously used to convert coal to natural gas. The acquisition provided for an insurance recovery, now valued at million recorded in Other assets, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which will be used to help offset remediation costs. We also have a million regulatory asset for manufactured gas processing sites; see Note 2 for additional information. As of December 31, 2022 , we had million accrued for remediation of Iowa s manufactured gas processing site as the landowner. As of December 31, 2022 , we had million accrued for remediation of Nebraska s manufactured gas processing site as the land owner. These liabilities are included in Other deferre d credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remediation cost estimate could change materially due to results of further investigations, actions of environmental agencies or the financial viability of other responsible parties. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations. We believe the amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements to satisfy alleged liabilities are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies. However, there can be no assurance that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims and other matters discussed, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations will not exceed the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements. We record gain contingencies when realized and expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements that include indemnification in favor of third parties, such as information technology agreements, purchase and sale agreements and lease contracts. We have also agreed to indemnify our directors, officers and employees in accordance with our articles of incorporation, as amended. Certain agreements do not contain any limits on our liability and therefore, it is not possible to estimate our potential liability under these indemnifications. In certain cases, we have recourse against third parties with respect to these indemnities. Further, we maintain insurance policies that may provide coverage against certain claims under these indemnities. GT Resources, LLC v. Black Hills Corporation, Case No. 2020CV30751 (U.S. District Court for the City and County of Denver, Colorado) On April 13, 2022, a jury awarded million for claims made by GT Resources, LLC GTR against BHC and two of its subsidiaries (Black Hills Exploration and Production, Inc. and Black Hills Gas Resources, Inc.), which ceased oil and natural gas operations in 2018 as part of BHC s decision to exit the exploration and production business. The claims involved a dispute over a million-acre concession award in Costa Rica which was acquired by a BHC subsidiary in 2003. GTR retained rights to receive a royalty interest on any hydrocarbon production from the concession upon the occurrence of contingent events. GTR contended that BHC and its subsidiaries failed to adequately pursue the opportunity and failed to transfer the concession to GTR. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the verdict and have appealed the verdict. At this time, we believe that the liability related to this matter, if any, is not reasonably estimable. Guarantees We have entered into various parent company-level guarantees providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain of our subsidiaries. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, represent guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow those subsidiaries to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. The agreements, which are off-balance sheet commitments, include support for business operations, indemnification for reclamation and surety bonds. The guarantees were entered into in the normal course of business. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of activities covered by these guarantees, such liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8 for additional information on our off-balance sheet Letters of Credit commitment.

 million and extending the term through July 19, 2026 with extension options (subject to consent from lenders). This Revolving Credit Facility is similar to the former revolving credit facility, which includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase total commitments up to billion with the consent of the administrative agent, the issuing agents and each bank increasing or providing a new commitment. Borrowings continue to be available under a base rate or various Eurodollar rate options. The interest costs associated with the letters of credit or borrowings and the commitment fee under the Revolving Credit Facility are determined based upon our Corporate credit rating from S P, Fitch and Moody's for our senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current credit ratings, the margins for base rate borrowings, Eurodollar borrowings and letters of credit were , and , respectively, at December 31, 2022 . Based on our credit ratings, a commitment fee was charged on the unused amount at December 31, 2022. We have a million, unsecured CP Program that is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the CP Program, either individually or in the aggregate, cannot exceed million. The notes issued under the CP Program may have maturities not to exceed days from the date of issuance and bear interest (or are sold at par less a discount representing an interest factor) based on, among other things, the size and maturity date of the note, the frequency of the issuance and our credit ratings. Under the CP Program, any borrowings rank equally with our unsecured debt. Notes under the CP Program are not registered and are offered and issued pursuant to a registration exemption.

Term Loan On February 24, 2021, we entered into a , million unsecured term loan to provide additional liquidity and to meet our cash needs related to the incremental fuel, purchased power and natural gas costs from Winter Storm Uri. The term loan carried prepayment penalty and was subject to the same covenant requirements as our Revolving Credit Facility. We repaid million of this term loan in the first quarter of 2021.

We plan to re-finance our million, , senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2023, at or before maturity date. In the event we are unable to refinance these senior unsecured notes, we have sufficient alternative measures available to manage cash flows such that our current plans to manage liquidity would be sufficient to meet our obligations in the foreseeable future. Our debt securities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, all of which the Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with at December 31, 2022. See below for additional information. Substantially all of the tangible utility property of South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric is subject to the lien of indentures securing their first mortgage bonds. First mortgage bonds of South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric may be issued in amounts limited by property, earnings and other provisions of the mortgage indentures. Debt Transactions On August 26, 2021, we completed a public debt offering which consisted of million, senior unsecured notes due August 23, 2024. The notes include an optional redemption provision and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, without premium, on or after February 23, 2022. The proceeds from the offering, which were net of million of deferred financing costs, were used to repay amounts outstanding under our term loan entered into on February 24, 2021. On June 17, 2020, we completed a public debt offering which consisted of million of senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2030. The proceeds were used to repay short-term debt and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs 

Debt Covenants Revolving Credit Facility Under our Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a Consolidated Indebtedness to Capitalization Ratio not to exceed to 1.00. Subject to applicable cure periods, a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding. 

Less than 

Wyoming Electric Covenants within Wyoming Electric's financing agreements require Wyoming Electric to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Dividend Restrictions Our Revolving Credit Facility and other debt obligations contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends when a default or event of default occurs. Due to our holding company structure, substantially all of our operating cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by our subsidiaries. The cash to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived from these cash flows. As a result, certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements could affect the levels of distributions allowed to be made by our subsidiaries. Our Utilities are generally limited to the amount of dividends allowed to be paid to our utility holding company under the Federal Power Act and settlement agreements with state regulatory jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of restricted net assets at our Utilities that may not be distributed to our utility holding company in the form of a loan or dividend was approximat ely million. South Dakota Electric and Wyoming Electric are generally limited to the amount of dividends allowed to be paid to our utility holding company under certain financing agreements. Equity At-the-Market Equity Offering Program On August 3, 2020, we filed a shelf registration and DRSPP with the SEC. In conjunction with these shelf filings, we renewed the ATM. The renewed ATM program, which allows us to sell shares of our common stock, is the same as the prior program other than the aggregate value increased from million to million and a forward sales option was incorporated. This forward sales option allows us to sell our shares through the ATM program at the current trading price without actually issuing any shares to satisfy the sale until a future date. Under the ATM, shares may be offered from time to time pursuant to a sales agreement dated August 3, 2020. Shares of common stock are offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC.

 We periodically have wholesale power purchase and sale contracts used to manage purchased power costs and load requirements associated with serving our electric customers that are considered derivative instruments due to not qualifying for the normal purchase and normal sales exception to derivative accounting. Changes in the fair value of these commodity derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. To support our Choice Gas Program customers, we buy, sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices by managing commodity price risk. As a result of these activities, this area of our business is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks using over-the-counter and exchange traded options and swaps with counterparties in anticipation of forecasted purchases and sales during time frames ranging from January 2023 through December 2024. A portion of our over-the-counter swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with deliveries under fixed price forward contracts to deliver gas to our Choice Gas Program customers. The gain or loss on these designated derivatives is reported in AOCI in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Effectiveness of our hedging position is evaluated at least quarterly.

As discussed above, financial instruments used in our regulated Gas Utilities are not designated as cash flow hedges. However, there is no earnings impact because the unrealized gains and losses arising from the use of these financial instruments are recorded as Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities. The net unrealized losses included in a Regulatory asset related to these financial instruments used in our Gas Utilities were million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. For our Electric Utilities, the unrealized gains and losses arising from these derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and equivalents and short-term borrowings approximates fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Notes payable consist of commercial paper borrowings and are not traded on an exchange; therefore, they are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

(a) Long-term debt is valued based on observable inputs available either directly or indirectly for similar liabilities in active markets and therefore is classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Carrying amount of long-term debt is net of deferred financing costs.

 MW, combined-cycle natural gas generating facility located in Pueblo, Colorado. In 2016, Black Hills Electric Generation sold a , non-controlling interest in Black Hills Colorado IPP to a third-party buyer. Black Hills Electric Generation is the operator of the facility, which is contracted to provide capacity and energy through 2031 to Colorado Electric. The accounting for a partial sale of a subsidiary in which control is maintained and the subsidiary continues to be consolidated is specified under ASC 810, Consolidation . The partial sale is required to be recorded as an equity transaction with no resulting gain or loss on the sale. GAAP requires that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries and affiliates be reported in the equity section of a company s balance sheet. Net income available for common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was reduced by million, million, and million, respectively, attributable to this non-controlling interest. The net income allocable to the non-controlling interest holder is based on ownership interest with the exception of certain agreed upon adjustments. Distributions of net income attributable to this non-controlling interest are due within days following the end of a quarter but may be withheld as necessary by Black Hills Electric Generation. Black Hills Colorado IPP has been determined to be a VIE in which the Company has a variable interest. Black Hills Electric Generation has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE as Black Hills Electric Generation is the operator and manager of the generation facility and, as such, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Black Hills Colorado IPP s economic performance. Black Hills Electric Generation, as the primary beneficiary, continues to consolidate Black Hills Colorado IPP. Black Hills Colorado IPP has not received financial or other support from the Company outside of pre-existing contractual arrangements during the reporting period. Black Hills Colorado IPP does not have any debt and its cash flows from operations are sufficient to support its ongoing operations.

of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. The 401(k) Plan provides a Company matching contribution for all eligible participants. Certain eligible participants who are not currently accruing a benefit in the Pension Plan also receive a Company retirement contribution based on the participant s age and years of service. Vesting of all Company and matching contributions occurs at per year with vesting when the participant has years of service with the Company. Defined Benefit Pension Plan We have defined benefit pension plan, the Black Hills Retirement Plan (Pension Plan). The Pension Plan covers certain eligible employees of the Company. The benefits for the Pension Plan are based on years of service and calculations of average earnings during a specific time period prior to retirement. The Pension Plan is closed to new employees and frozen for certain employees who did not meet age and service-based criteria. The Pension Plan assets are held in a Master Trust. Our Board of Directors has approved the Pension Plan s investment policy. The objective of the investment policy is to manage assets in such a way that will allow the eventual settlement of our obligations to the Pension Plan s beneficiaries. To meet this objective, our pension assets are managed by an outside adviser using a portfolio strategy that will provide liquidity to meet the Pension Plan s benefit payment obligations. The Pension Plan s assets consist primarily of equity, fixed income and hedged investments. The expected rate of return on the Pension Plan assets is determined by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both equity and fixed income markets, taking into account asset allocation, the correlation between asset class returns and the mix of active and passive investments. The Pension Plan utilizes a dynamic asset allocation where the target range to return-seeking and liability-hedging assets is determined based on the funded status of the Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the expected rate of return on pensio n plan assets was based on the targeted asset allocation range of to return-seeking assets and to liability-he dging assets. Our Pension Plan is funded in compliance with the federal government s funding requirements. Plan Assets

Supplemental Non-qualified Defined Benefit Plans We have various supplemental retirement plans for key executives of the Company. The plans are non-qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans (Supplemental Plans). The Supplemental Plans are subject to various vesting schedules and are funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid. Non-pension Defined Benefit Postretirement Healthcare Plan BHC sponsors a retiree healthcare plan (Healthcare Plan) for employees who meet certain age and service requirements at retirement. Healthcare Plan benefits are subject to premiums, deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. A portion of the Healthcare Plan for participating business units are pre-funded via VEBA trusts. Pre-65 retirees as well as a grandfathered group of post-65 retirees receive their retiree medical benefits through the Black Hills self-insured retiree medical plans. Healthcare coverage for post-65 Medicare-eligible retirees is provided through an individual market healthcare exchange. We fund the Healthcare Plan on a cash basis as benefits are paid. The Healthcare Plan provides for partial pre-funding via VEBA trusts. Assets related to this pre-funding are held in trust and are for the benefit of the union and non-union employees located in the states of Arkansas, Iowa and Kansas. We do not pre-fund the Healthcare Plan for those employees outside Arkansas, Iowa and Kansas. Plan Contributions Contributions to the Pension Plan are cash contributions made directly to the Master Trust. Healthcare and Supplemental Plan contributions are made in the form of benefit payments. Healthcare benefits include company and participant paid premiums.

Additional information about assets of the benefit plans, including methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these assets, is as follows: Pension Plan Common Collective Trust Funds: These funds are valued based upon the redemption price of units held by the Pension Plan, which is based on the current fair value of the common collective trust funds underlying assets. Unit values are determined by the financial institution sponsoring such funds by dividing the fund s net assets at fair value by its units outstanding at the valuation dates. The Pension Plan s investments in common collective trust funds, with the exception of shares of the common collective trust-real estate are categorized as Level 2. The following investments are measured at NAV and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy, in accordance with accounting guidance: Common Collective Trust-Real Estate Funds : These funds are valued based on various factors of the underlying real estate properties, including market rent, market rent growth, occupancy levels, etc. As part of the trustee s valuation process, properties are externally appraised generally on an annual basis. The appraisals are conducted by reputable independent appraisal firms and signed by appraisers that are members of the Appraisal Institute, with professional designation of Member, Appraisal Institute. All external appraisals are performed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. We receive monthly statements from the trustee, along with the annual schedule of investments and rely on these reports for pricing the units of the fund. Hedge Funds: These funds represent investments in other investment funds that seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined, aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under all market conditions. Amounts are reported on a one-month lag. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using net asset value per share based on the fair value of the hedge fund s underlying investments. of the shares may be redeemed at the end of each month with a -day notice and full redemptions are available at the end of each quarter with -day notice and is limited to a percentage of the total net assets value of the fund. The net asset values are based on the fair value of each fund s underlying investments. There are no unfunded commitments related to these hedge funds. Non-pension Defined Benefit Postretirement Healthcare Plan Cash and Cash Equivalents: This represents an investment in Northern Institutional Government Assets Portfolio, which is a government money market fund. As shares held reflect quoted prices in an active market, they are categorized as Level 1. Other Plan Information

In 2012, we froze our Pension Plan and closed it to new participants. Since then, we have implemented various de-risking strategies including lump sum buyouts, the purchase of annuities and the reduction of return-seeking assets over time to a more liability-hedged portfolio. As a result, capital markets volatility had a limited impact to our unfunded status.

As of December 31, 2022, there was million of un recognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Performance Share Plan Prior to 2021, certain officers of the Company and its subsidiaries became participants in a market-based performance share award plan. Performance shares are awarded based on our total shareholder return over designated performance periods as measured against a selected peer group. In addition, certain stock price performance must be achieved for a payout to occur. The final value of the performance shares will vary according to the number of shares of common stock that are ultimately granted based upon the actual level of attainment of the performance criteria. These performance awards are paid in cash and in common stock. The cash portion accrued is classified as a liability and the stock portion is classified as equity. In the event of a change-in-control, performance awards are paid in cash. If it is determined that a change-in-control is probable, the equity portio n of million at December 31, 2022 would be reclassified as a liability.

The payout was fully accrued at December 31, 2022. Performance Share Units Beginning in 2021, certain officers of the Company, and its subsidiaries, were granted performance share units which have a vesting period, do not have voting rights until vested, and are subject to three specified conditions. A market condition of relative total shareholder return, and two equally weighted performance metrics of average earnings per share and the average cost to serve. The units are paid in common stock should conditions be met and can range from to of the target award. Dividend equivalents are accrued during the vesting period and paid out based on the final number of shares awarded. In the event of participant s death or retirement at age 55 or older, shares awarded vest on a pro-rata basis over the period. Performance Share Units - Market Condition The fair value of each share unit is based on the Company s closing price at December 31 of the year prior to the award and a Monte Carlo simulation. performance period relative to the designated peer group beginning January 1 of the award year.

 million of incremental fuel, purchased power and natural gas costs. We will recover these costs from customers over several years, which will increase our taxable income on our tax returns by the amounts collected for each respective year. The incremental costs from Winter Storm Uri were deductible in our 2021 tax return and created a net deferred tax liability, which had balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of million and million, respectively. The deferred tax liability is reversed with the same timing as the costs are recovered from our customers. The income tax deduction recognized from Winter Storm Uri created a million NOL in our 2021 federal income tax return and a million NOL in our state income tax returns. Our federal NOL carryforwards related to Winter Storm Uri and other recent adjustments no longer expire due to the TCJA; however, our state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates from 2023 to 2041. We do not anticipate material changes to our valuation allowance against the state NOL carryforwards from Winter Storm Uri. Therefore, we did not record an additional valuation allowance against the state NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. TCJA On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from to . As such, the Company remeasured the deferred income taxes at the federal tax rate as of December 31, 2017. The entities subject to regulatory construct have made their best estimate regarding the probability of settlements of net regulatory liabilities established pursuant to the TCJA. The amount of the settlements may change based on decisions and actions by the federal and state utility commissions, which could have a material impact on the Company s future results of operations, cash flows or financial position. A majority of the excess deferred taxes are subject to the average rate assumption method, as prescribed by the IRS, and will generally be amortized as a reduction of customer rates over the remaining lives of the related assets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the Company has amortized, or provided bill credits for, million, million and million of the regulatory liability. The portion that was eligible for amortization under the average rate assumption method in 2021 but is awaiting resolution of the treatment of these amounts in future regulatory proceedings has not been recognized and may be refunded in customer rates at any time in accordance with the resolution of pending or future regulatory proceedings. Beginning in 2022, the TJCA modified IRC 174 which changes how taxpayers account for research and development costs. After the IRC 174 modification, taxpayers must amortize specified research and experimental expenditures performed in the United States ratably over five years instead of deducting research and experimental expenditures. This modification did not have a material impact for the year ended December 31, 2022. Income Tax Expense (Benefit))

Effective Tax Rate 

(a) The state effective tax rate contains the tax expense attributable to multiple statutory state rate reductions in the Company's state jurisdictions. 

 (b) The effective tax rate reflects the income attributable to the non-controlling interest in Black Hills Colorado IPP for which a tax provision was not recorded. 

 (c) Flow-through adjustments related primarily to accounting method changes for tax purposes that allow us to take a current tax deduction for repair costs, certain indirect costs and gain deferral. We recorded a deferred income tax liability in recognition of the temporary difference created between book and tax treatment and flowed the tax benefit through to tax expense. A regulatory asset was established to reflect the recovery of future increases in taxes payable from customers as the temporary differences reverse. As a result of this regulatory treatment, we continue to record tax benefits consistent with the flow-through method. 

 (d) Primarily TCJA - see above. 

 (e) Primarily related to one-time bill credits of TCJA benefits which were delivered to Colorado Electric and Nebraska Gas customers in 2021. These bill credits, which resulted in a reduction in revenue, were offset by a reduction in income tax expense and resulted in a minimal impact to Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, we h ad a million valuat ion allowance against the state NOL carryforwards. Our 2022 analysis of the ability to utilize such NOLs resulte d in increa se in the valuation allowance. If the valuation allowance is adjusted due to higher or lower than anticipated utilization of the NOLs, the offsetting amount will affect tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 , we had a million valuation allowance against the state ITC carryforwards. Our 2022 analysis of the ability to utilize such ITC resulted in a million increase in the valuation allowance, which resulted in an increase to tax expense of million. The remaining million increase is attributable to our regulated business and is being accounted for under the deferral method whereby the credits are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset that generated the credit. The valuation allowance adjustment was primarily attributable to expiring state ITC credits. Unrecognized Tax Benefits

We had accrued interest (before tax effect) associated with income taxes at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company is subject to federal income tax as well as income tax in various state and local jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, we do not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease on or before December 31, 2023 .

 Accounts if the balance of such Accounts, combined with any other amounts required to be treated as deferred under a single plan pursuant to Code Section 409A, does not exceed the applicable dollar amount under Code Section 402(g)(1)(B), provided any other such aggregated amounts are also distributed in a lump sum at the same time. 
 
 6.7	 Acceleration of or Delay in Payments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VI, the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, may elect to accelerate the time or form of payment of an Account, provided such acceleration is permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4). The Board may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, delay the time for payment of an Account, to the extent permitted under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(7). 
 
 6.8	 Rules Applicable to Installment Payments . If a Payment Schedule specifies installment payments, payments will be made beginning as of the payment commencement date for such installments and shall continue to be made in each subsequent payment period until the number of installment payments specified in the Payment Schedule has been paid. The amount of each installment payment shall be determined by dividing (a) by (b), where (a) equals the Account Balance as of the last Valuation Date in the month preceding the month of payment (or as of such other date as approved by the Committee to facilitate administration of the Plan) and (b) equals the remaining number of installment payments. For purposes of Section 6.9, installment payments will be treated as a single payment. If an Account is payable in installments, the Account will continue to be credited with Earnings in accordance with Article VII hereof until the Account is completely distributed. 
 
 6.9	 Modifications to Payment Schedules . A Participant may modify the Payment Schedule elected by him or her with respect to an Account, consistent with the permissible Payment Schedules available under the Plan for the applicable payment event, provided such modification complies with the requirements of this Section 6.9. 
 
 (a)	 Time of Election . The modification election must be submitted to the Committee not less than 12 months prior to the date payments would have commenced under the Payment Schedule in effect prior to modification (the Prior Election ). 
 (b)	 Date of Payment under Modified Payment Schedule . The date payments are to commence under the modified Payment Schedule must be no earlier than five years after the date payment would have commenced under the Prior Election. Under no circumstances may a modification election result in an acceleration of payments in violation of Code Section 409A. If the Participant modifies only the form, and not the commencement date for payment, payments shall commence on the fifth anniversary of the date payment would have commenced under the Prior Election. 
 (c)	 Irrevocability; Effective Date . A modification election is irrevocable when filed and becomes effective 12 months after the filing date. 
 
 17 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 (d)	 Effect on Accounts . An election to modify a Payment Schedule is specific to the Account or payment event to which it applies, and shall not be construed to affect the Payment Schedules or payment events of any other Accounts. A modification election has no effect on the lump sum cash out for Account Balances at or below 100,000 as provided in Section 6.3. 
 
 Article VII 
 Valuation of Account Balances; Investments 
 7.1	 Valuation. Deferrals shall be credited to appropriate Accounts on the date such Compensation would have been paid to the Participant absent the Compensation Deferral Agreement. Valuation of Accounts shall be performed under procedures approved by the Committee. 
 
 7.2	 Earnings Credit. Each Account will be credited with Earnings on each Business Day, based upon the Participant s investment allocation among a menu of investment options selected in advance by the Board, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII investment allocation ). 
 
 7.3	 Investment Options . Investment options will be determined by the Board. The Board, in its sole discretion, shall be permitted to add or remove investment options from the Plan menu from time to time, provided that any such additions or removals of investment options shall not be effective with respect to any period prior to the effective date of such change. 
 
 7.4	 Investment Allocations. A Participant s investment allocation constitutes a deemed, not actual, investment among the investment options comprising the investment menu. At no time shall a Participant have any real or beneficial ownership in any investment option included in the investment menu, nor shall the Participating Employer or any trustee acting on its behalf have any obligation to purchase actual securities as a result of a Participant s investment allocation. A Participant s investment allocation shall be used solely for purposes of adjusting the value of a Participant s Account Balances. 
 A Participant shall specify an investment allocation for each of his Accounts in accordance with procedures established by the Committee. Allocation among the investment options must be designated in increments of 1 . The Participant s investment allocation will become effective on the same Business Day or, in the case of investment allocations received after a time specified by the Committee, the next Business Day. 
 
 A Participant may change an investment allocation on any Business Day, both with respect to future credits to the Plan and with respect to existing Account Balances, in accordance with procedures adopted by the Committee. Changes shall become effective on the same Business Day or, in the case of investment allocations received after a time specified by the Committee, the next Business Day, and shall be applied prospectively. 
 
 18 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 7.5	 Unallocated Deferrals and Accounts. If the Participant fails to make an investment allocation with respect to an Account, such Account shall be invested in an investment option, the primary objective of which is the preservation of capital, as determined by the Committee. 
 
 7.6	 Valuations Final After 180 Days . The Participant shall have 180 days following the Valuation Date on which the Participant failed to receive the full amount of Earnings and to file a claim under Article XI for the correction of such error. 

Article VIII 
 Administration 
 8.1	 Plan Administration . This Plan shall be administered by the Committee which shall have discretionary authority to make, interpret and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and to utilize its discretion to decide or resolve any and all questions, including but not limited to eligibility for benefits and interpretations of this Plan and its terms, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Claims for benefits shall be filed with the Committee and resolved in accordance with the claims procedures in Article XI. 
 
 8.2	 Withholding. The Employer may withhold or cause to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Plan all federal, state, local and other taxes as shall be legally required to be withheld. Further, with respect to any federal, state, local and other taxes that may be required to be withheld at any time as a result of the crediting, vesting or payment of benefits under the Plan, the Employer shall have the right to (a) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of any such taxes, or (b) withhold any such taxes from any compensation otherwise payable in cash to the Participant. 
 
 8.3	 Indemnification. The Participating Employers shall indemnify and hold harmless each employee, officer, director, agent or organization, to whom or to which are delegated duties, responsibilities, and authority under the Plan or otherwise with respect to administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, the Committee, its delegees and its agents, against all claims, liabilities, fines and penalties, and all expenses reasonably incurred by or imposed upon him or it (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees) which arise as a result of his or its actions or failure to act in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan to the extent lawfully allowable and to the extent that such claim, liability, fine, penalty, or expense is not paid for by liability insurance purchased or paid for by the Participating Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participating Employer shall not indemnify any person or organization if his or its actions or failure to act are due to gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any such amount incurred through any settlement or compromise of any action unless the Participating Employer consents in writing to such settlement or compromise. 
 
 8.4	 Delegation of Authority. In the administration of this Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, 
 19 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 and may from time to time consult with legal counsel who shall be legal counsel to the Company. 
 
 8.5	 Binding Decisions or Actions. The decision or action of the Committee in respect of any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations thereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan. 

Article IX 
 Amendment and Termination 
 9.1	 Amendment and Termination. The Company may at any time and from time to time amend the Plan or may terminate the Plan as provided in this Article IX. Each Participating Employer may also terminate its participation in the Plan. 
 9.2	 Amendments. The Company, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may amend the Plan at any time and for any reason, provided that any such amendment shall not reduce the vested Account Balances of any Participant accrued as of the date of any such amendment or restatement (as if the Participant had incurred a voluntary Separation from Service on such date). The Board of Directors of the Company may delegate to the Committee the authority to amend the Plan without the consent of the Board of Directors for the purpose of: (i) conforming the Plan to the requirements of law; (ii) facilitating the administration of the Plan; (iii) clarifying provisions based on the Committee s interpretation of the Plan documents; and (iv) making such other amendments as the Board of Directors may authorize. No amendment is needed to revise the list of Participating Employers set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. 
 9.3	 Termination. The Company, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may terminate the Plan and pay Participants and Beneficiaries their Account Balances in a single lump sum at any time, to the extent and in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix). 
 
 9.4	 Accounts Taxable Under Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to constitute a plan of deferred compensation that meets the requirements for deferral of income taxation under Code Section 409A. The Committee, pursuant to its authority to interpret the Plan, may sever from the Plan or any Compensation Deferral Agreement any provision or exercise of a right that otherwise would result in a violation of Code Section 409A. 

Article X 
 Informal Funding 
 10.1	 General Assets. Obligations established under the terms of the Plan may be satisfied from the general funds of the Participating Employers, or a trust described in this Article X. No Participant, spouse or Beneficiary shall have any right, title or interest whatever in assets of the Participating Employers. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a 
 20 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 fiduciary relationship, between the Participating Employers and any Employee, spouse, or Beneficiary. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments hereunder, such rights are no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Participating Employer. 
 
 10.2	 Rabbi Trust. A Participating Employer may, in its sole discretion, establish a grantor trust, commonly known as a rabbi trust, as a vehicle for accumulating assets to pay benefits under the Plan. Payments under the Plan may be paid from the general assets of the Participating Employer or from the assets of any such rabbi trust. Payment from any such source shall reduce the obligation owed to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control, the Company shall (a) establish a rabbi trust (unless a rabbi trust has already been established before the Change in Control), (b) make a contribution to such rabbi trust in an amount equal to the accrued liabilities under this Plan as of the date of the Change in Control, and (c) make such additional contributions to the rabbi trust thereafter as may be necessary from time to time to reflect any subsequent increase in liabilities under the Plan after the Change in Control. 

Article XI 
 Claims 
 11.1	 Filing a Claim. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Plan shall be filed in writing with the Committee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any claim filed with the Committee and any decision by the Committee denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Participant or Beneficiary filing the claim (the Claimant ). Notice of a claim for payments shall be delivered to the Committee within 90 days of the latest date upon which the payment could have been timely made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and Code Section 409A, and if not paid, the Participant or Beneficiary must file a claim under this Article XI not later than 180 days after such latest date. If the Participant or Beneficiary fails to file a timely claim, the Participant forfeits any amounts to which he or she may have been entitled to receive under the claim. 
 
 (a)	 In General. Notice of a denial of benefits (other than claims based on disability) will be provided within 90 days of the Committee s receipt of the Claimant's claim for benefits. If the Committee determines that it needs additional time to review the claim, the Committee will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 90-day period. The extension will not be more than 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period and the notice of extension will explain the special circumstances that require the extension and the date by which the Committee expects to make a decision. 
 
 21 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 (b)	 Disability Benefits. Notice of denial of claims based on disability will be provided within forty-five (45) days of the Committee s receipt of the Claimant s claim for disability benefits. If the Committee determines that it needs additional time to review the disability claim, the Committee will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 45-day period. If the Committee determines that a decision cannot be made within the first extension period due to matters beyond the control of the Committee, the time period for making a determination may be further extended for an additional 30 days. If such an additional extension is necessary, the Committee shall notify the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension. Any notice of extension shall indicate the circumstances necessitating the extension of time, the date by which the Committee expects to furnish a notice of decision, the specific standards on which such entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim and any additional information needed to resolve those issues. A Claimant will be provided a minimum of 45 days to submit any necessary additional information to the Committee. In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for furnishing a notice of decision shall be tolled from the date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the earlier of the date the Claimant responds to the request for additional information or the response deadline. 
 
 (c)	 Contents of Notice. If a claim for benefits is completely or partially denied, notice of such denial shall be in writing. Any electronic notification shall comply with the standards imposed by Department of Labor Regulation 29 CFR 2520.104b-1(c)(1)(i), (iii), and (iv). The notice of denial shall set forth the specific reasons for denial in plain language. The notice shall: (i) cite the pertinent provisions of the Plan document, and (ii) explain, where appropriate, how the Claimant can perfect the claim, including a description of any additional material or information necessary to complete the claim and why such material or information is necessary. The claim denial also shall include an explanation of the claims review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including the right to appeal the decision, the deadline by which such appeal must be filed and a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse decision on appeal and the specific date by which such a civil action must commence under Section 11.4. In the case of a complete or partial denial of a disability benefit claim, the notice shall provide such information and shall be communicated in the manner required under applicable Department of Labor regulations. 
 
 11.2	 Appeal of Denied Claims. A Claimant whose claim has been completely or partially denied shall be entitled to appeal the claim denial by filing a written appeal with a committee designated to hear such appeals (the Appeals Committee ). A Claimant who timely requests a review of the denied claim (or his or her authorized representative) may review, upon request and free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other 
 22 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 information relevant to the denial and may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim to the Appeals Committee. All written comments, documents, records, and other information shall be considered relevant if the information: (i) was relied upon in making a benefits determination, (ii) was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making a benefits decision regardless of whether it was relied upon to make the decision, or (iii) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards established for making benefit decisions. The review shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Appeals Committee may, in its sole discretion and if it deems appropriate or necessary, decide to hold a hearing with respect to the claim appeal. 
 
 (a) In General. Appeal of a denied benefits claim (other than a disability benefits claim) must be filed in writing with the Appeals Committee no later than 60 days after receipt of the written notification of such claim denial. The Appeals Committee shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 60 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Appeals Committee expects to render the determination on review. The review will take into account comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 

(b) Disability Benefits. Appeal of a denied disability benefits claim must be filed in writing with the Appeals Committee no later than 180 days after receipt of the written notification of such claim denial. The review shall be conducted in accordance with applicable Department of Labor regulations. The Appeals Committee shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 45 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 90 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Appeals Committee expects to render the determination on review. Following its review of any additional information submitted by the Claimant, the Appeals Committee shall render a decision on its review of the denied claim. 

23 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 (c) Contents of Notice. If a benefits claim is completely or partially denied on review, notice of such denial shall be in writing. Any electronic notification shall comply with the standards imposed by Department of Labor Regulation 29 CFR 2520.104b-1(c)(1)(i), (iii), and (iv). Such notice shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. 

The decision on review shall set forth: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial, (ii) specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, (iii) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information relevant (as defined above) to the Claimant s claim, and (iv) a statement of the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA, following an adverse decision on review and the specific date by which such a civil action must commence under Section 11.4. 
 
 For the denial of a disability benefit, the notice will also include such additional information and be communicated in the manner required under applicable Department of Labor regulations. 
 
 11.3	 Legal Action. A Claimant may not bring any legal action relating to a claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the claims procedures under the Plan and exhausted his or administrative remedies under Sections 11.1 and 11.2. No such legal action may be brought more than twelve (12) months following the notice of denial of benefits under Section 11.2, or if no appeal is filed by the applicable appeals deadline, twelve (12) months following the appeals deadline. 
 
 If a Participant or Beneficiary prevails in a legal proceeding brought under the Plan to enforce the rights of such Participant or any other similarly situated Participant or Beneficiary, in whole or in part, the Participating Employer shall reimburse such Participant or Beneficiary for all legal costs, expenses, attorneys fees and such other liabilities incurred as a result of such proceedings. If the legal proceeding is brought in connection with a change in control as defined in Section 11.3, the Participant or Beneficiary may file a claim directly with the trustee for reimbursement of such costs, expenses and fees. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of the claim shall be treated as if it were an addition to the Participant s or Beneficiary s Account Balance and will be included in determining the Participating Employer s trust funding obligation under Section 10.2. 
 
 11.4	 Discretion of Appeals Committee. All interpretations, determinations and decisions of the Appeals Committee with respect to any claim shall be made in its sole discretion, and shall be final and conclusive.

 24 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 12.1	 Assignment. No interest of any Participant, spouse or Beneficiary under this Plan and no benefit payable hereunder shall be assigned as security for a loan, and any such purported assignment shall be null, void and of no effect, nor shall any such interest or any such benefit be subject in any manner, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment or encumbrance by or through any Participant, spouse or Beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the Committee has the discretion to make payments to an alternate payee in accordance with the terms of a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)). 
 
 	The Company may assign any or all of its liabilities under this Plan in connection with any restructuring, recapitalization, sale of assets or other similar transactions affecting a Participating Employer without the consent of the Participant. 
 
 12.2	 No Legal or Equitable Rights or Interest. No Participant or other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Plan that are not expressly granted in this Plan. Participation in this Plan does not give any person any right to be retained in the service of the Participating Employer. The right and power of a Participating Employer to dismiss or discharge an Employee is expressly reserved. The Participating Employers make no representations or warranties as to the tax consequences to a Participant or a Participant s beneficiaries resulting from a deferral of income pursuant to the Plan. 
 
 12.3	 No Employment Contract. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to constitute a contract of employment between an Employee and a Participating Employer. 
 
 12.4	 Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be delivered to the Committee under this Plan shall be delivered in writing, in person, or through such electronic means (such as secure facsimile) as is established by the Committee. Notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. Written transmission shall be sent by certified mail to: 
 
 Black Hills Corporation 
 P.O. Box 1400 
 Rapid city, sd 57709 
 attn: human resources/RETIREMENT SERVICES 
 
 Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing or hand-delivered, or sent by mail to the last known address of the Participant. 
 
 12.5	 Headings. The headings of Sections are included solely for convenience of reference, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of this Plan, the text shall control. 
 
 12.6	 Invalid or Unenforceable Provisions. If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions 
 25 

Black Hills Corporation Amended Restated Post-2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 hereof and the Committee may elect in its sole discretion to construe such invalid or unenforceable provisions in a manner that conforms to applicable law or as if such provisions, to the extent invalid or unenforceable, had not been included. 
 
 12.7	 Lost Participants or Beneficiaries. Any Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a benefit from the Plan has the duty to keep the Committee advised of his or her current mailing address. If benefit payments are returned to the Plan or are not presented for payment after a reasonable amount of time, the Committee shall presume that the payee is missing. The Committee, after making such efforts as in its discretion it deems reasonable and appropriate to locate the payee, shall stop payment on any uncashed checks and may discontinue making future payments until contact with the payee is restored. If the Committee is unable to locate the Participant or Beneficiary after five years of the date payment is scheduled to be made, provided that a Participant s Account shall not be credited with Earnings following the first anniversary of such date on which payment is to be made and further provided, however, that such benefit shall be reinstated, without further adjustment for interest, if a valid claim is made by or on behalf of the Participant or Beneficiary for all or part of the forfeited benefit. 
 
 12.8	 Facility of Payment to a Minor. If a distribution is to be made to a minor, or to a person who is otherwise incompetent, then the Committee may, in its discretion, make such distribution: (i) to the legal guardian, or if none, to a parent of a minor payee with whom the payee maintains his or her residence, or (ii) to the conservator or committee or, if none, to the person having custody of an incompetent payee. Any such distribution shall fully discharge the Committee, the Company, and the Plan from further liability on account thereof. 
 
 12.9	 Governing Law. To the extent not preempted by ERISA, the laws of the State of South Dakota shall govern the construction and administration of the Plan. 
 12.10	 Compliance With Code Section 409A; No Guarantee . This Plan is intended to be administered in compliance with Code Section 409A and each provision of the Plan shall be interpreted consistent with Code Section 409A. Although the Company intends for the Plan to comply with Code Section 409A, the tax treatment of benefits under the Plan is not warranted or guaranteed, and neither the Company, any other Employer, the Committee, nor the Board of Directors (nor any of their delegates) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts that may be owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other taxpayer claiming benefits hereunder. No Employer shall have any legal obligation to a Participant with respect to taxes imposed under Code Section 409A.

Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Award Agreement or another written agreement between a Participant and the Company, the following provisions shall apply to outstanding Awards that were granted on or after the Restatement Effective Date in the event of a Change in Control that involves a Corporate Transaction. 
 (a)	 Continuation, Assumption or Replacement of Awards. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, the surviving or successor entity (or its corporate parent) may continue, assume or replace Awards outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control (with such adjustments as may be required or permitted by Section 4.3), and such Awards or replacements therefor shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms. A surviving or successor entity may elect to continue, assume or replace only some Awards or portions of Awards. For purposes of this Section 17.1(a), an Award shall be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Change in Control and in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A (and Code Section 424 if the Award is an ISO), either (i) the contractual obligations represented by the Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or successor entity (or its corporate parent) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to the Award and any exercise price thereof that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Change in Control, or (ii) the Participant has received a comparable equity-based award that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Change in Control and contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those of the Award; provided that for a performance-based award, (i) such Awards will continue to be subject to any continuing service-based vesting requirements of the Awards through the end of the original Performance Period and (ii) the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting conditions will be determined by (A) assuming that the performance goals, other than for a relevant total shareholder return goal, are achieved at the target level as set forth in the Award Agreement, and (B) calculating the relevant total shareholder return goal achievement by deeming the date of the Change in Control to be the last day of the Performance Period as reference for determining the average closing price on the applicable stock exchange for the applicable number trading days immediately prior to the end of the Performance Period. 
 19 

(b)	 Acceleration. If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then (i) all outstanding Option and SAR Awards shall become fully vested and exercisable for such period of time prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction as is deemed fair and equitable by the Committee, and shall terminate at the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and (ii) all outstanding Full Value Awards shall fully vest immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction (with vesting for a performance-based award determined by (A) assuming that the performance goals, other than for a relevant total shareholder return goal, are achieved at the target level as set forth in the Award Agreement, and (B) calculating the relevant total shareholder return goal achievement by deeming the date of the Change in Control to be the last day of the Performance Period as reference for determining the average closing price on the applicable stock exchange for the applicable number trading days immediately prior to the end of the Performance Period). The Committee shall provide written notice of the period of accelerated exercisability of Option and SAR Awards to all affected Participants. The exercise of any Option or SAR Award whose exercisability is accelerated as provided in this Section 17.1(b) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Corporate Transaction and shall be effective only immediately before such consummation. 
 (c)	 Payment for Awards. If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee may provide that some or all of such outstanding Awards shall be canceled at or immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction in exchange for payments to the holders as provided in this Section 17.1(c). The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly for purposes of this Section 17.1(c). The payment for any Award canceled shall be in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Committee) of the consideration that would otherwise be received in the Corporate Transaction for the number of Shares subject to the Award, and (ii) the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the Shares subject to such Award. If the amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence is not a positive number with respect to any Award, such Award may be canceled pursuant to this Section 17.1(c) without payment of any kind to the affected Participant. With respect to an Award whose vesting is subject to the satisfaction of specified performance goals, the number of Shares subject to such an Award for purposes of this Section 17.1(c) shall be the number of Shares as to which the Award would have been deemed fully vested for purposes of Section 17.1(b). Payment of any amount under this Section 17.1(c) shall be made in such form, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion, which may or may not be the same as the form, terms and conditions applicable to payments to the Company s stockholders in connection with the Corporate Transaction, and may, in the Committee s discretion, include subjecting such payments to vesting conditions comparable to those of the Award canceled, subjecting such payments to escrow or holdback terms comparable to those imposed upon the Company s stockholders under the Corporate Transaction, or calculating and paying the present value of payments that would otherwise be subject to escrow or holdback terms. 
 17.2	Termination After a Change in Control. Unless treatment of an Award is otherwise provided for under Sections 17.1(b) or (c) or in an applicable Award Agreement or another written agreement between a Participant and the Company, , and if within twenty-four (24) months after such Change in Control, a Participant experiences an involuntary termination of the Participant s employment or provision of services to the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries for reasons other than Cause or a voluntary termination for Good Reason, then (i) outstanding Option and SAR Awards issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant s termination of service, and (ii) any Full Value Awards that are not yet fully vested shall immediately vest in full (for a performance-based award, vesting will be determined by (A) assuming that the performance goals, other than for a relevant total shareholder return goal, are achieved at the target level as set forth in the Award Agreement, and (B) calculating the relevant total shareholder return goal achievement by deeming the date of the Change in Control to be the last day of the Performance Period as reference for determining the average closing price on the applicable stock exchange for the applicable number trading days immediately prior to the end of the Performance Period). 
 20 

17.3	Prior Awards. Awards granted prior to the Restatement Effective Date shall not be subject to Sections 17.1 and 17.2, and shall instead be subject to Section 17 of the Plan as in effect on the day prior to the Restatement Effective Date. 
 17.4	Dissolution or Liquidation . Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Award Agreement, in the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Committee will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. An Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 
 17.5	Discretion . The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the event of a Change in Control, and may include such further provisions and limitations in any Award Agreement as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company.

 18.1	Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination. Subject to Section 18.3, the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend, or terminate this Plan and any Award Agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, that, without the prior approval of the Company s shareholders and except as provided in Section 4.3, the terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or SARs or cancel, exchange, buyout or surrender outstanding Options or SARS in exchange for cash, other awards or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs.

The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under this Plan. 
 18.3	Awards Previously Granted. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary (other than Section 18.4), no termination, amendment, suspension, or modification of this Plan or an Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under this Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award. 
 18.4	Amendment to Conform to Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Board of Directors may amend the Plan or an Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or an Award Agreement to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature (including, but not limited to, Code Section 409A), and to the administrative regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder. 
 Article 19	Withholding 
 19.1	Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount equal to the tax withholding obligations to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld (but not to exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction) with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan. 
 21 

19.2	Share Withholding. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or SARs, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, or upon the achievement of performance goals related to Performance Shares, or any other taxable event arising as a result of an Award granted hereunder, Participants may elect to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined. All such elections shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
 Article 20	Successors 
 All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 
 Article 21	General Provisions 
 21.1	Forfeiture Events and Clawbacks. 
 (a)	The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, clawback or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of service for Cause, termination of the Participant s provision of services to the Company, Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary, violation of material Company, Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries.

At its election, the Company may provide Employee and Employee s dependents with taxable cash in the amount of the value of equivalent benefits outside the Welfare Benefits plans. The Company s obligation with respect to the foregoing benefit shall be discontinued in the event that Employee becomes eligible for health, dental or vision benefits of a subsequent employer. For purposes of this provision, Employee shall have a duty to inform Company as to the terms and conditions of any subsequent employment and the corresponding benefits the Employee is eligible for in connection with such employment. To the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Code Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to Employee under this Agreement shall be paid to Employee on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to Employee) during one year may not 

9 

affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. 

(v) If Employee was eligible for the Retiree Healthcare Plan immediately prior to a Change in Control, then as of Employee s Termination Date, the Employee s benefit under the Retiree Healthcare Plan shall be determined as if (i) Employee had completed an additional three (3) Years of Plan Participation (as defined in the Retiree Healthcare Plan), and (ii) Employee were three (3) years older for determining eligibility for plan benefits. Furthermore, if the Employee is not eligible for benefits after the age and participation adjustment, then the Retirement Medical Savings Account (after adjustment for three years of participation) will be considered vested, and upon attainment of age 55 the Employee shall be deemed eligible for Retiree Healthcare Plan benefits, with the vested Retirement Medical Savings Account available to offset premiums. At its election, the Company may provide Employee and Employee s dependents with equivalent benefits outside the Retiree Healthcare Plan. 

(vi) If Employee was a participant in the Restoration Plan and the Pension Plan immediately prior to a Change in Control, then as of Employee s Termination Date, Employee s Restoration Plan benefit shall be determined as if (i) Employee completed three (3) additional years of Credited Service under the Pension Plan, and (ii) the Employee received Annual Compensation during each additional year of Credited Service. For purposes of this subsection 9(b)(vi) , if the Employee is not entitled to any future benefit accruals in the Restoration Plan as of the Effective Date the Employee shall not receive any additional Credited Service or Annual Compensation when determining their Restoration benefit. 

Furthermore, the Employee shall be made 100 vested for purposes of the Restoration Plan, if the Employee is a participant in such plan (for purposes of this subsection) and is not already fully vested. 
 
 (vii) If Employee was a participant in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan immediately prior to a Change in Control, then as of Employee s Termination Date, Employee s Non-Elective Account in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan shall become immediately vested and be determined as if (i) Employee had completed three (3) additional Plan Years of participation and earned the related Supplemental Matching Contributions, Supplemental Retirement Contributions, and Supplemental Target Contributions (all as defined in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan); no investment earnings shall be attributed for this additional period, and (ii) Employee received Annual Compensation during each additional Plan Year of participation. 

10 

For purposes of this subsection 9(b)(vii) , the additional contributions under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (Supplemental Matching Contributions, Supplemental Retirement Contributions, and Supplemental Target Contributions) shall be determined without regard to any offsets from the Retirement Savings Plan. (This has the same effect as if the Supplemental Matching Contributions and Supplemental Retirement Contributions were determined on total pay rather than only on pay over IRS pay limits.) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Employee is a specified employee (as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A), no payment of any amount under this Section 9 that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be made before the date which is six (6) months after the date of the Employee s Termination Date, or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid or provided under Code Section 409A without being subject to additional taxes thereunder. To the extent that the Agreement provides for such nonqualified deferred compensation, it is intended to be compliant with Code Section 409A, and shall be interpreted and administered accordingly. 
 
 10. NO MITIGATION OBLIGATION . 

Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and except as provided in Section 9(b)(iv) , such payments shall not be reduced whether or not Employee obtains other employment. 
 
 11. TAX EFFECT . 

No additional payments shall be made to the Employee to account for any excise taxes, income taxes, interest or penalties the employee may incur due to receipt of any Severance Compensation or other payment, benefit, or distribution of any type by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any written or unwritten policy of the Company to the contrary, if it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any other agreement between the Company and the Employee or otherwise (a Payment or Payments ), would constitute a parachute payment Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would, but for this Section 11 , be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the Excise Tax ), then prior to making the Payments, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the Net Benefit (as defined below) to the Employee of the Payments after payment of the Excise Tax to (ii) the Net Benefit to the Employee if the Payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. Only if the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount under (ii) above will the Payments be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Payments is subject to the Excise Tax. Net Benefit shall mean the present value of the Payments net of all federal, state, local, foreign income, employment and excise taxes. The Payments shall be reduced in a manner that maximizes the Employee s economic position. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero. Any determination required under this Section 11 , including whether any payments or benefits are parachute payments, shall be made by an independent third party expert retained by the Company. The Employee shall provide the Company with such information and documents as the Company may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 11 . The Company s determination shall be final and binding on the Employee. The parties acknowledge that the Employee is solely responsible for the payment of any 
 
 11 

Excise Tax that is assessed based upon a payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any other payment made by the Company pursuant to any other plan or obligation. 
 
 As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the independent third party expert, however, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed to or for the benefit of Employee which should not have been so paid or distributed (an Overpayment or that additional amounts which shall not have been paid or distributed to or for the benefit of Employee should have been so paid or distributed (an Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the amount. If the independent third party expert, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Employee which the independent third party expert believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment must be treated (if permitted by applicable law) for all purposes as a loan ab initio for which Employee must repay the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan may be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent that such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which Employee is subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. If the independent third party expert, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, the independent third party expert must promptly notify the Company of the amount of the Underpayment and such amount, together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, must be paid to Employee. 
 
 12. OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES . 

Following a Termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason during the Protection Period, the Company shall, at its expense, permit the Employee to participate in outplacement assistance services, as determined by the Company, which are: (a) as to executive officers, at a level appropriate for senior management of a public company, and (b) not more than six (6) months in duration. Outplacement services shall be provided in kind; cash shall not be paid in lieu thereof, nor will cash compensation be increased if Employee declines or does not use outplacement services. All outplacement services shall be provided by the last day of the second calendar year beginning after the Employee s Termination Date. 
 
 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS . 

This Agreement shall be fully binding upon any Successor Employer or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to the business and/or assets of the Company, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Agreement as if no succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor or assign would not by the foregoing provision, or by operation of law, be bound by this Agreement, the Company shall require such successor or assign to expressly and unconditionally assume and agree to perform all the obligations of the Company and each Successor Employer under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company and each Successor Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place. Any failure to obtain such assumption and continuation of this Agreement shall constitute a material breach hereof. Reference to the Company in this Agreement shall, following the Effective Date, include any Successor Employer. 
 
 Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the Employee, Employee s beneficiaries or legal representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

 For purposes of this Section 14 , the Employee will not be deemed to have incurred legal fees or expenses reasonably or in good faith if, following resolution of a dispute under this Agreement, Employee has failed to prevail on at least one material issue in dispute. The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement hereunder during any given calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year. Employee shall submit verification of expenses to the Company within sixty (60) days from the date the expense was incurred, and the Company shall reimburse eligible expenses within thirty (30) days thereafter, but in any case no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. The right to reimbursement of legal fees and expenses hereunder may not be exchanged for cash or any other benefit. 
 
 15. NOTICE . 

For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement (including the Notice of Termination) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address of Employee or in the case of the Company, to the principal executive office to the attention of the Board of the Company. All notices and communications shall be deemed to have been received on the date of delivery thereof if personally delivered, or on the third business day after the mailing thereof, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Employee s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and for which Employee may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or reduce such rights as Employee may have under any other agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided however that in the event that Employee becomes eligible for any cash severance benefits under a Company severance program, plan or policy as a result of a termination during the Protection Period, then the Severance Compensation payable to Employee under this Agreement shall be reduced by any such cash severance benefits. Amounts which are vested benefits or which Employee is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be payable in accordance with such plan or program, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, in the event that Employee is not a participant in or eligible to participate in any Welfare Benefits or the Pension Plan, then nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to provide for or suggest the right in Employee to be a participant in or be eligible to participate in the Welfare Benefits or the Pension Plan.

No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Employee and the Company.

(This has the same effect as if the Supplemental Matching Contributions and Supplemental Retirement Contributions were determined on total pay rather than only on pay over IRS pay limits.) 

10 
 
 (viii) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Employee is a specified employee (as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A), no payment of any amount under this Section 9 that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be made before the date which is six (6) months after the date of the Employee s Termination Date, or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid or provided under Code Section 409A without being subject to additional taxes thereunder.

No additional payments shall be made to the Employee to account for any excise taxes, income taxes, interest or penalties the employee may incur due to receipt of any Severance Compensation or other payment, benefit, or distribution of any type by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any written or unwritten policy of the Company to the contrary, if it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any other agreement between the Company and the Employee or otherwise (a Payment or Payments ), would constitute a parachute payment Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would, but for this Section 11 , be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the Excise Tax ), then prior to making the Payments, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the Net Benefit (as defined below) to the Employee of the Payments after payment of the Excise Tax to (ii) the Net Benefit to the Employee if the Payments are limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. Only if the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount under (ii) above will the Payments be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Payments is subject to the Excise Tax. Net Benefit shall mean the present value of the Payments net of all federal, state, local, foreign income, employment and excise taxes. The Payments shall be reduced in a manner that maximizes the Employee s economic position. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero. Any determination required under this Section 11 , including whether any payments or benefits are parachute payments, shall be made by an independent third party expert retained by the Company. The Employee shall provide the Company with such information and documents as the Company may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 11 . The Company s determination shall be final and binding on the Employee. The parties acknowledge that the Employee is solely responsible for the payment of any Excise Tax that is assessed based upon a payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any other payment made by the Company pursuant to any other plan or obligation. 

11 
 
 As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the independent third party expert, however, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed to or for the benefit of Employee which should not have been so paid or distributed (an Overpayment or that additional amounts which shall not have been paid or distributed to or for the benefit of Employee should have been so paid or distributed (an Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the amount. If the independent third party expert, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or Employee which the independent third party expert believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment must be treated (if permitted by applicable law) for all purposes as a loan ab initio for which Employee must repay the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan may be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by Employee to the Company if and to the extent that such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which Employee is subject to tax under Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. If the independent third party expert, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, the independent third party expert must promptly notify the Company of the amount of the Underpayment and such amount, together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, must be paid to Employee. 
 
 12. OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES . 

Following a Termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason during the Protection Period, the Company shall, at its expense, permit the Employee to participate in outplacement assistance services, as determined by the Company, which are: (a) as to executive officers, at a level appropriate for senior management of a public company; and (b) not more than six (6) months in duration. Outplacement services shall be provided in kind; cash shall not be paid in lieu thereof, nor will cash compensation be increased if Employee declines or does not use outplacement services. All outplacement services shall be provided by the last day of the second calendar year beginning after the Employee s Termination Date. 
 
 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS . 

This Agreement shall be fully binding upon any Successor Employer or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to the business and/or assets of the Company, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Agreement as if no succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor or assign would not by the foregoing provision, or by operation of law, be bound by this Agreement, the Company shall require such successor or assign to expressly and unconditionally assume and agree to perform all the obligations of the Company and each Successor Employer under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company and each Successor Employer would be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place. Any failure to obtain such assumption and continuation of this Agreement shall constitute a material breach hereof. Reference to the Company in this Agreement shall, following the Effective Date, include any Successor Employer. 
 
 Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the Employee, Employee s beneficiaries or legal representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

The portion of the Units subject to this Award that will be deemed Earned Units as of the Scheduled Vesting Date will be determined in accordance with the formula specified in Appendix A , and in no event will the number of Units that are deemed Earned Units exceed 200 of the Target Number of Performance Units. Any Units subject to this Agreement that are not earned and do not vest as of the Scheduled Vesting Date will be forfeited. 
 
 Article 7. Settlement of Units

Appendix A 
 Earned Units and Performance Measures 
 
 The determination of the number of Units that will be earned and vested as of the Scheduled Vesting Date specified above will be determined as follows: 

Performance Measure (each as defined below) 
 Weighting 
 Performance Goal 
 Award Multiplier 

Relative TSR 
 60 
 Maximum 
 90 th Percentile 
 200 

Target 
 50 th Percentile 
 100 

Threshold 
 25 th Percentile 
 25 

Average EPS as Adjusted 
 20 
 Maximum 
 ____ 
 200 

Target 
 ____ 
 100 

Threshold 
 ____ 
 25 

Average Cost to Serve 
 20 
 Maximum 
 ___ 
 200 

Target 
 ___ 
 100 

Threshold 
 ___ 
 25 

Based on the actual level of achievement of each Performance Measure, the applicable Award Multiplier will be calculated from the table above by determining where the Company s actual performance falls relative to the Performance Goals specified in the applicable column of the table, and then selecting the corresponding Award Multiplier associated with each Performance Measure. If the actual amount of any of these Performance Measures is between two Performance Goal amounts shown in the applicable column of the table, the corresponding Award Multiplier will be determined by linear interpolation between the two relevant Award Multipliers shown in the table. If the actual amount of any of the Performance Measures for the Performance Period is less than the corresponding Threshold Performance Goal specified in the table, the corresponding Award Multiplier is zero, and if it is greater than the corresponding Maximum Performance Goal specified in the table, the corresponding Award Multiplier will be equal to the percentage specified for the Maximum Performance Goal. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if absolute TSR is negative during the Performance Period, the total number of Earned Units for the achievement of the Relative TSR Performance Goal will not exceed Target and (ii) if Relative TSR is below Threshold, but absolute TSR is above 35 , the Relative TSR Performance Measure will be deemed to be satisfied at Threshold. 
 
 The number of Performance Units earned during the Performance Period that will vest as of the Vesting Date will be calculated using the following formula: 
 
 [Relative TSR Weighting x (Target Number of Performance Units + Dividend Units credited during the Performance Period and before the Scheduled Vesting Date)] x Relative TSR Award Multiplier 
 + 
 i 

[Average EPS as Adjusted Weighting x (Target Number of Performance Units + Dividend Units credited during the Performance Period and before the Scheduled Vesting Date)] x Average EPS as Adjusted Award Multiplier 
 + 
 [Average Cost to Serve Weighting x (Target Number of Performance Units + Dividend Units credited during the Performance Period and before the Scheduled Vesting Date)] x Average Cost to Serve Award Multiplier 

where: 
 
 	The Relative TSR Weighting, Average EPS as Adjusted Weighting, Average EPS as Adjusted Weighting and the applicable Award Multiplier are derived from the table above, 
 
 	 Target Number of Performance Units is the number set forth at the beginning of this Agreement; and 
 
 	Dividend Units is defined in Section 8 of the Agreement. 
 
 Relative TSR Calculation 
 For this purpose, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) shall be determined as follows (rounded to nearest basis point): 

Total Shareholder Return 
 = 
 Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid Beginning Stock Price 

Beginning Stock Price shall mean the average closing price (rounded to nearest cent xx.xx) on the applicable stock exchange of one share of Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days preceding the grant date; Ending Stock Price shall mean the average closing price (rounded to nearest cent xx.xx) on the applicable stock exchange of one share of stock for the last ten (10) trading days of the Performance Period; Change in Stock Price shall mean the difference between the Beginning Stock Price and the Ending Stock Price; and Dividends Paid shall mean the total of all dividends (unrounded) on one (1) share of stock with Dividend Payable Dates during the Performance Period. Following the TSR determination, the Company s Percentile Rank shall be determined as follows: 
 	 
 Percentile Rank shall be determined by listing from highest TSR to lowest TSR each company in the Peer Index (excluding the Company) as described on Appendix B . The top company would have a one hundred percentile (100 rank and the bottom company would have a zero percentile (0.0 rank. Each company in between would be one hundred divided by n minus one (100/(n-1)) (rounded to nearest basis point - x.xx above the company below it, where n is the total number of companies in the Peer Index. The Company percentile rank would then be interpolated based on the Company TSR, resulting in the Company s Relative TSR. 
 
 If the Company s or any Peer Index company s stock splits (or if there are other similar subdivisions, consolidations or changes in such company s stock or capitalization), such company s TSR performance will be proportionately adjusted for the stock split or other change so as not to give an advantage or disadvantage to such company by comparison to the other Peer Index companies. 
 
 ii 

Average EPS as Adjusted Calculation 
 Average EPS as Adjusted is defined as diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for material, non-recurring events that are approved by the Company s Audit Committee (such as impairment charges, one-time tax events, changes to accounting rules, etc.). No adjustment shall be made to normalize the impact of extreme weather. 
 Average Cost to Serve Calculation 
 Average Cost to Serve is defined as non-fuel operations and maintenance (O M) expense divided by gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for material, non-recurring events that are approved by the Company s Audit Committee (such as impairment charges, one-time tax events, changes to accounting rules, etc.). No adjustment shall be made to normalize the impact of extreme weather. 
 
 iii 

Appendix B 
 Companies Included in EEI Index 
 as of December 31, 2021, Excluding Black Hills Corporation 

The peer group for Relative TSR performance purposes consists of all companies comprising the EEI Index. Throughout the performance period, companies may be added or dropped from the index due to mergers or other activities. At the end of the performance period, new companies that are added to the index are included in the rankings as if they had been in the ranking from the beginning, provided there is sufficient trading history to include them in the final calculation. When a company is dropped from the index, everything related to the company is excluded as if it were never in the index.

Exhibit 95 
 Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Sections 1503(a) of Dodd-Frank is included below. 
 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration Safety Data 
 Safety is a core value at Black Hills Corporation and at each of its subsidiary operations. We have in place a comprehensive safety program that includes extensive health and safety training for all employees, site inspections, emergency response preparedness, crisis communications training, incident investigation, regulatory compliance training and process auditing, as well as an open dialogue between all levels of employees. The goals of our processes are to eliminate exposure to hazards in the workplace, ensure that we comply with all mine safety regulations, and support regulatory and industry efforts to improve the health and safety of our employees along with the industry as a whole. 
 
 Under the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act, each operator of a coal or other mine is required to include certain mine safety results in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our mining operation, consisting of Wyodak Coal Mine, is subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). Below we present the following information regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022. In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The information presented includes: 
 
 Total number of violations of mandatory health and safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which we have received a citation from MSHA; 

Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act; 

Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health and safety standards under section 104(d) of the Mine Act; 

Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act; and 

Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act. 

The table below sets forth the total number of citations and/or orders issued by MSHA to BHE Wyodak Mine under the indicated provisions of the Mine Act, together with the total dollar value of proposed MSHA assessments received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, together with the Administrative Law Judges thereof, for BHE Wyodak Mine, our only mining complex. All citations were abated within 24 hours of issue.
