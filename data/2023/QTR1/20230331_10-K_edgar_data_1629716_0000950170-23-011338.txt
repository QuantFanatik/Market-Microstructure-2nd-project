 Item 1117 of Regulation AB 
 Disclosure from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee: 
 
 Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 
 
 On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 
 
 On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence; violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for 
 6 

summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. 
 
 On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 
 
 On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the First Department granted DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion for reargument and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to 17 certificates at issue (including all claims as to 5 trusts), leaving 17 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 
 
 It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement.

2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Management of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of commercial and multifamily loans (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage and multifamily pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 
 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management assessment and attestation for such activities. 
 
 With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06). The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 
 
 The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

The Company has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 
 The Company has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole . 
 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Asserting Party requires this vendor to provide to the Asserting Party a Report of their assessment of compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, as the means of assessing the vendor s compliance with Servicing Criterion (d)(1)(ii). 
 The Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2022, and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.

 620 S. Tryon Street 
 Charlotte, North Carolina 28202-1842 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors 
 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform) except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has determined that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform, except for certain tax payment activities that the Company has engaged various vendors to perform. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 As described in the accompanying 2022 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure 
 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. 

Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset - backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 

200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Citibank, N.A.: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that the Agency and Trust division of Citibank, N.A. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria for publicly-issued i.e. , transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) commercial mortgage-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2011 as listed in Appendix A of the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, for which the Company provides the following servicing functions: paying agent, certificate administration and trustee; or certificate administration and paying agent (the Platform ), except for Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The Company has determined that Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. With respect to Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Governors Northmarq Capital, LLC 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by Northmarq Capital, LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (Management s Assertion), that Northmarq Capital, LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (the Platform), including only those asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding the following criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)C and D, 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform covered by this report. Appendices A and B to Management s Assertion identify the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for Northmarq Capital, LLC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in Management s Assertion, for servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criterion applicable to these vendors as permitted by Section 200.06 of the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (Section 200.06). As permitted by Section 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Section 200.06 for the vendors and related criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Section 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Northmarq Capital, LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
