Table of Contents 
 PART I This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to them. In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as may, will, should, could, would, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, projects, predicts, potential, intend and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: our future operating expenses, our future losses, the success of our strategy as a royalty aggregator, the assumptions underlying our business model; the extent to which issued and pending patents may protect the products and processes in which we have an ownership or royalty interest and prevent the use of the covered subject matter by third parties, the potential of our existing product candidates to lead to the development of commercial products, our ability to receive potential milestone or royalty payments under license and collaboration agreements and the amount and timing of receipt of those payments, and the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry and for our licensees engaged in the development of new products in a regulated market. Among other things: there can be no assurance that our revenues or expenses will meet any expectations or follow any trend(s); we may be unable to retain our key employees; litigation, arbitration or other disputes with third parties may have a material adverse effect on us; our product candidates subject to our out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we may not be successful in entering into out-license agreements for our product candidates; if our therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to manufacture and market them; products or technologies of other companies may render some or all of our product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; even once approved, a product may be subject to additional testing or significant marketing restrictions, its approval may be withdrawn or it may be voluntarily taken off the market; and we and our licensees are subject to various state and federal healthcare related laws and regulations that may impact the commercialization of our product candidates and could subject us to significant fines and penalties. These and other risks, including those related to current economic and financial market conditions, are contained principally in Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and you should not place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date that they were made. These cautionary statements should be considered in connection with any written or oral forward-looking statements that we may issue in the future. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements after completion of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. All references to portfolio in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with a basket of drug products in development. We use our trademarks, trade names and services marks in this report as well as trademarks, trade names and service marks that are the property of other organizations. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this report appear without the and symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that

 we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or that the applicable owner will not assert its rights, to these trademarks and trade names. Risk Factors Summary Below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. Importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties summarized in this risk factor summary, as well as other risks and uncertainties that we face, can be found under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The below summary is qualified in its entirety by that more complete discussion of such risks and uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as part of your evaluation of the risks associated with an investment in our securities. 
 Our acquisitions of potential future royalty and/or milestone payments may not produce anticipated revenues and/or may be negatively affected by a default or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s), and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able to recuperate our capital expenditures associated with the acquisition. Many of our potential royalty acquisitions may be associated with drug products that are in clinical development and have not yet been commercialized. To the extent that such products are not successfully developed and commercialized, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Acquisitions of potential royalties associated with development stage biopharmaceutical product candidates are subject to a number of uncertainties. We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty and milestone payments. While we typically have primary or back-up rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, errors, may be undetectable and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies to resolve any disputes resulting from any such audit. The lack of liquidity of our acquisitions of future potential milestones and royalties may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price, if at all. As a result, we may suffer losses. We have sustained losses in the past, and we expect to sustain losses in the foreseeable future. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation rates, uncertain credit and global financial markets and supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical events, have adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact the future our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which could cause delays or elimination of our receipts of potential milestones and royalties under our licensing or royalty and milestone acquisition arrangements. Our royalty aggregator strategy may require that we register with the SEC as an investment company in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we were to become an investment company and be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act, those restrictions would likely require significant changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative burdens to our operations. Our royalty aggregator strategy may require us to raise additional funds to acquire milestone and royalty interests; we cannot be certain that funds will be available or available at an acceptable cost of capital, and if they are not available, we may be unsuccessful in acquiring milestone and royalty interests to sustain the business in the future.

Table of Contents 
 Information available to us about the biopharmaceutical products underlying the potential royalties we buy may be limited and therefore our ability to analyze each product and its potential future cash flow may be similarly limited. Our future income is dependent upon numerous potential milestone and royalty-specific assumptions and, if these assumptions prove not to be accurate, we may not achieve our anticipated rates of returns. Reductions in potential milestone or royalty payments compared to expectations, or impairments in the value of potential milestones and royalties acquired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A large percentage of the calculated net present value of our portfolio is represented by a limited number of products. The failure of any one of these products to move forward in clinical development or commercialization may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. We rely heavily on license and collaboration relationships, and any litigation, arbitration or other disputes with our licensees, collaborators and their partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us. In the event of any disagreement that cannot be resolved satisfactorily to us, we may end up being paid less than anticipated on such product or involved in costly and time-consuming arbitration or litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and future prospects. Our potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third parties to provide services in connection with their product candidate development and manufacturing programs. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could adversely affect our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidate development. We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire potential milestone and royalty streams on other products, product candidates, or programs, or other companies to grow and diversify our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any such products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. Our potential milestone and royalty providers face uncertain results of clinical trials of product candidates. If our potential royalty providers therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our potential royalty providers will be unable to market them. We do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the product candidates in which we have an ownership, milestone or royalty interest. If we and our potential royalty providers are unable to protect our intellectual property, in particular patent protection for principal products, product candidates and processes in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and prevent the use of the covered subject matter by third parties, our potential royalty providers ability to compete in the market will be harmed, and we may not realize our profit potential. We have a continuing obligation to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, which will be an on-going expenditure for us and may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 
 Item 1. Business Overview and Strategy XOMA is a biotech royalty aggregator. We have a sizable portfolio of economic rights to future potential milestone and royalty payments associated with partnered commercial and pre-commercial therapeutic candidates. Our 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 portfolio was built through acquisitions of rights to future milestones and royalties that we have made since our royalty aggregator business model was implemented in 2017 combined with outlicensing our proprietary products and platforms from our legacy discovery and development business. We expect that most of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. Our strategy is to expand our portfolio by acquiring additional potential milestone and royalty revenue streams on drug product candidates from third parties. Expanding our portfolio through these acquisitions can allow for further diversification across therapeutic areas and development stages. Our ideal target acquisitions are in pre-commercial stages of development, have an expected long duration of market exclusivity, have high revenue potential, and are partnered with a large pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical enterprise. Portfolio Highlights The following table highlights key assets included in our portfolio of potential future milestone and royalty streams. This table does not include all assets because certain assets are subject to confidentiality agreements.

We also assumed ObsEva s ongoing obligations under the Organon License Agreement and the Merck KGaA License Agreement. Pursuant to the Organon License Agreement, XOMA is eligible to receive up to 475.0 million in payments for ebopiprant development, commercialization and sales-based milestones. If ebopiprant is successfully commercialized, we will be entitled to receive royalties that range from low to mid-teens from Organon and will be required to make mid-single-digit royalty payments to Merck KGaA. We paid ObsEva a 15.0 million upfront payment at closing and will pay potential earn-out payments of up to 97.5 million for development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, representing a portion of what we will receive pursuant to the Organon License Agreement. Affitech Commercial Payment Purchase Agreement In October 2021, we entered into the Affitech CPPA, pursuant to which we purchased a future stream of commercial payment rights to Roche s faricimab from Affitech for an upfront payment of 6.0 million. We are eligible to receive commercial payments from Roche consisting of 0.50 of future net sales of faricimab for a ten-year period following the first commercial sales in each applicable jurisdiction. In January 2022, Genentech, a member of the Roche group, received approval from the FDA to commercialize VABYSMO (faricimab-svoa) for the treatment of wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Pursuant to the Affitech CPPA, we paid Affitech a 5.0 million milestone tied to these U.S. marketing approvals. In September 2022, in connection with Roche receiving approval from the European Commission to commercialize VABYSMO for the treatment of neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema, we made a 3.0 million milestone payment to Affitech pursuant to the terms of the Affitech CPPA. As a result of the EC Approval, we are eligible to receive a 0.5 commercial payment stream for ten years from the first commercial sale of VABYSMO in Europe.

Table of Contents 
 In August 2022, we received 0.5 million from Roche representing the first commercial payment for sales of VABYSMO during the first six months of 2022, and in February 2023 we received 2.4 million for sales of VABYSMO during the second half of 2022. Kuros Royalty Purchase Agreement In July 2021, we entered into the Kuros RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to 100 of the potential future royalties from commercial sales, which are tiered from high single-digit to low double-digits, and up to 25.5 million in pre-commercial milestone payments associated with an existing license agreement related to Checkmate Pharmaceuticals vidutolimod (CMP-001), a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, packaged in a virus-like particle, for an upfront payment of 7.0 million. We may pay additional sales-based milestones to Kuros of up to 142.5 million representing a portion of the future royalties on commercial sales. In May 2022, Regeneron completed its acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals resulting in a 5.0 million milestone payment to Kuros. Pursuant to the Kuros RPA, we were entitled to 50 of the milestone payment, which we received in July 2022. Viracta Royalty Purchase Agreement In March 2021, we entered into the Viracta RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the right to receive future royalties, milestones, and other payments related to two clinical-stage drug candidates for 13.5 million. The first candidate, DAY101 (pan-RAF kinase inhibitor), is being developed by Day One Biopharmaceuticals, and the second candidate, vosaroxin (topoisomerase II inhibitor), is being developed by Denovo Biopharma. We acquired the right to receive (i) up to 54.0 million in potential milestones, potential royalties on sales, if approved, and other payments related to DAY101, excluding up to 20.0 million consideration retained by Viracta, and (ii) up to 57.0 million in potential regulatory and commercial milestones and high single-digit royalties on sales related to vosaroxin, if approved. Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement In September 2018, we entered into the Agenus RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the right to receive 33 of the future royalties due to Agenus from Incyte (net of certain royalties payable by Agenus to a third party) and 10 of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of six Incyte immuno-oncology assets. In addition, we acquired the right to receive 33 of the future royalties due to Agenus from Merck and 10 of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of MK-4830, an immuno-oncology product currently in clinical development. Pursuant to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, our share in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones is up to 59.5 million, and the royalties have no limit. Under the terms of the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Agenus 15.0 million. In November 2020, MK-4830 advanced to Phase 2 development stage. As a result of the advancement, Agenus earned a 10.0 million clinical development milestone pursuant to its license agreement with Merck, of which we received 1.0 million. Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement In February 2019, we entered into the Bioasis RPA, pursuant to which we acquired future milestone, royalty and option fee payment rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a License Agreement between Bioasis and Prothena Biosciences Limited. Under the terms of the Bioasis RPA, we paid Bioasis an upfront cash payment of 0.3 million and will be required to make contingent future cash payments of up to 0.2 million to Bioasis if and when the licensed product candidates reach certain development milestones. As of December 31, 2021, none of the development milestones had been achieved. In addition, we were granted an option to purchase a 1 royalty right on the next two license agreements entered into between Bioasis and third-party licensees subject to certain payments and conditions as well as a right of first negotiation on the purchase of royalty rights on subsequent Bioasis license agreements with third parties.

 In November 2020, we entered into the Second Bioasis RPA, pursuant to which we acquired potential future milestone and other payments, and royalty rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a research collaboration and license agreement between Bioasis and Chiesi. We paid Bioasis 1.2 million upon closing of the Second Bioasis RPA for the purchased rights. Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement In April 2019, we entered into the Aronora RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to potential royalties and a portion of upfront, milestone, and option payments associated with five anti-thrombotic hematology drug products in development: three candidates subject to Aronora s collaboration Bayer (the Bayer Products and two additional early-stage candidates (the non-Bayer Products ). Under the terms of the Aronora RPA, we made a 6.0 million upfront payment to Aronora when the transaction closed on June 26, 2019, and in September 2019 we made an additional 3.0 million payment for the three Bayer Products that were active as of September 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Aronora RPA, if we receive 250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product, we will be required to pay associated tiered milestones payments to Aronora in an aggregate amount of up to 85.0 million per product. The tiered milestones will be paid based on various royalty tiers prior to reaching 250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product. We will retain royalties per product in excess of 250.0 million. We will receive, on average, low single-digit royalties on future sales of the Bayer Products and 10 of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones related to the Bayer Products. In addition, we purchased from Aronora the right to receive low single-digit percentage of net sales of the non-Bayer Products and 10 of all future payments, including upfront payments, option payments and developmental, regulatory and sales milestone payments on potential future sales of the non-Bayer Products. In July 2020, Bayer elected to not exercise its option on the third Bayer Product and that product is now subject to the same economics as the non-Bayer Products. Palobiofarma Royalty Purchase Agreement In September 2019, we entered into the Palo RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to potential royalty payments in low single-digit percentages of aggregate net sales associated with six drug candidates in various clinical development stages, targeting the adenosine pathway with potential applications in solid tumors, non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, psoriasis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other indications (the Palo Licensed Products that are being developed by Palo. Novartis is a development partner on NIR178, one of the Palo Licensed Products, and NIR178 is being developed pursuant to a license agreement between Palo and Novartis. Under the terms of the Palo RPA, we paid Palo 10.0 million for the rights to potential royalty payments on future sales of the Palo Licensed Products. Selected Programs Underlying Our Portfolio Historically, we have licensed product candidates or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, such as Novartis and Takeda, in pursuit of new antibody products under which we are eligible to receive potential future milestone payments and royalties. The following is a summary of material license and collaboration agreements that represent a significant component of our portfolio. Novartis Anti-TGF Antibody (NIS793) In September 2015, we and Novartis entered into the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGF antibody program NIS793 ). Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. Under the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, we received a 37.0 million upfront fee, and were eligible to receive up to a total of 480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single-digits to low double-digits. Novartis obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and

 country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. This program is currently in clinical testing. In October 2020, we earned a 25.0 million milestone upon the dosing of the first patient in Novartis first NIS793 Phase 2 clinical trial. As specified under the terms the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, we received 17.7 million in cash and the remaining balance of 7.3 million was recognized as a reduction to our debt obligation to Novartis. In July 2021, Novartis announced the FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation to NIS793 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In October 2021, we earned a 35.0 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in Novartis first NIS793 Phase 3 clinical trial. We are eligible to receive remaining milestones up to a total of 410.0 million under the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement. Upon receipt of regulatory approval to commercialize NIS793, we will receive tiered royalties on net product sales that range from the mid-single-digit to the low double-digits percentage rate. Novartis Anti-IL-1 Antibody (VPM087) In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into the Gevokizumab License Agreement, under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab VPM087 (a clinical-stage anti-IL-1 b product candidate) and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the Gevokizumab License Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of VPM087 and products containing such antibody. Under the Gevokizumab License Agreement, we received total consideration of 30.0 million in 2017 for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, 15.7 million was paid in cash and 14.3 million (equal to 12.0 million) was paid by Novartis, on our behalf, to settle our loan with Les Laboratories Servier. In addition, Novartis extended the maturity date on our debt to Novartis to September 30, 2022. In June 2021, we repaid its entire outstanding debt balance to Novartis. We also received 5.0 million related to the sale of 539,131 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of 9.2742. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to 438.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single digit to mid-teens. This program is in Phase 1 clinical testing. Unless terminated earlier, the Gevokizumab License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis royalty obligations end. The Gevokizumab License Agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the Gevokizumab License Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety with six months prior written notice. In March 2023, Novartis notified us that based upon a strategic review of the development program, Novartis will not initiate further studies of gevokizumab in gastrointestinal cancers. Novartis study to evaluate treatment with gevokizumab with standard of care anti-cancer therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal, gastroesophageal, and renal cancers will continue to primary analysis, which is anticipated later this year. Novartis Anti-CD40 Antibody In February 2004, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, multi-product collaboration agreement with Chiron to research, develop and commercialize multiple antibody products for the treatment of cancer, and such agreement was replaced with the Chiron Collaboration Agreement entered in May of 2005. The Chiron Collaboration Agreement was a risk-sharing arrangement whereby Chiron and XOMA shared expenses and revenues on a 70-30 basis, with XOMA s share being 30 . Financial terms included a loan facility from Chiron to XOMA, secured by XOMA s 30 ownership interest in the collaboration, of up to 50.0 million to fund up to 75 of our share of expenses beginning in 2005.

 In October 2005, Chiron announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Novartis under which Novartis acquired all of the shares of Chiron that it did not already own. This transaction closed in 2006 at which time Novartis acquired Chiron s interest in the Chiron Collaboration Agreement. In July of 2008, Novartis and XOMA restructured the Chiron Collaboration Agreement, which involved six development programs including iscalimab, a fully human anti-CD40 antagonist antibody intended as a treatment for B-cell mediated diseases, including malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As part of the restructuring, Novartis, the successor to Chiron, was granted, among other things, control over the ongoing product development collaborations remaining thereunder, including iscalimab. In September 2015, the parties agreed to reduce the royalty-style payments that XOMA is eligible to receive on sales of Novartis clinical-stage anti-CD40 antibodies (such as iscalimab). These royalty-style payments are tiered based on sales levels and now have percentage rates ranging from mid-single-digit to low teens. In September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant. In September 2022, after an interim analysis of data, Novartis also decided to discontinue its study of CFZ533 in liver transplant. Novartis is continuing iscalimab studies in other indications such as Sj gren s Syndrome, Lupus Nephritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Our right to royalty-style payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the first commercial sale of each product in each country. Takeda In November 2006, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with Takeda under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda. Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we may receive additional milestone payments aggregating up to 19.0 million relating to TAK-079 (mezagitamab) and a 4 royalty on future sales of all products subject to this license, including TAK-169, which entered a phase 1 study in February 2020. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent (or 12 years from first commercial sale if there is significant generic competition post patent-expiration). In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to 3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In November 2020, the first patient was dosed in Takeda s Phase 2 study of mezagitamab and we earned a 2.0 million milestone payment from Takeda. We are eligible to receive remaining milestones up to a total of 16.0 million under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In August 2021, Molecular Templates, Inc., assumed full rights to TAK-169 from Takeda, including full control of TAK-169 clinical development, per the terms of its terminated collaboration agreement with Takeda. In January 2022, we earned a development milestone of 0.8 million pursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.

 Rezolute In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Rezolute pursuant to which we granted an exclusive global license to Rezolute to develop and commercialize X358 (now RZ358 products for all indications. We and Rezolute also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Rezolute agreed to issue to us, as consideration for receiving the license for RZ358, a certain number of its common stock related to its future financing activities. Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is responsible for all development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities associated with RZ358 and is required to make certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments to us of up to 232.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria. Under the license agreement, we are also eligible to receive royalties ranging from the high single-digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of any commercial product incorporating RZ358. Rezolute s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular RZ358 product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. Rezolute s future royalty obligations in the United States will be reduced by 20 if the manufacture, use or sale of a licensed product is not covered by a valid XOMA patent claim, until such a claim is issued. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are eligible to receive a low single-digit royalty on sales of Rezolute s other non-RZ358 products from its current programs, including RZ402 which is in Phase 1 clinical testing. Rezolute s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular Rezolute product and country will continue for the longer of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or for so long as Rezolute or its licensee is selling such product in such country, provided that any such licensee royalty will terminate upon the termination of the licensee s obligation to make payments to Rezolute based on sales of such product in such country. The license agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Rezolute also has a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety on ninety days notice at any time. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we have the right to terminate the license agreement if Rezolute challenges the licensed patents. No consideration was exchanged upon execution of the arrangement. In consideration for receiving the license for RZ358, Rezolute agreed to issue shares of its common stock and pay cash to us upon the occurrence of Rezolute s financing activities. The license agreement was subsequently amended in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement as amended, we received a total of 6.0 million upon Rezolute s achievement of financing activities and 8.5 million in installment payments through October 2020. We also received 161,861 shares of common stock of Rezolute (on an as-adjusted post reverse-split basis). In January 2022, Rezolute dosed the last patient in its Phase 2b clinical trial for RZ358, which triggered a 2.0 million milestone payment due to XOMA pursuant to our Rezolute License Agreement. Janssen We and Janssen were parties to a license agreement which was terminated in 2017. In August 2019, we and Janssen entered into a new agreement pursuant to which we granted a non-exclusive license to Janssen to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates under our patents and know-how. Under the new agreement, Janssen made a one-time payment of 2.5 million to us. Additionally, for each drug candidate, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to 3.0 million upon Janssen s achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory approval events. Additional milestones may be due for drug candidates, which are the subject of multiple clinical trials. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a 0.75 royalty on net sales of each product. Janssen s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue until the eighth-year-and-sixth-month anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The new agreement will remain in effect unless terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties.

 In May 2021, we announced we earned a 0.5 million milestone from Janssen, upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating one of Janssen s biologic assets. In December 2021, we earned a 0.2 million milestone pursuant to our agreement with Janssen. Affimed In April 2021, we entered into a new agreement with Affimed, under which we are eligible to receive payments from Affimed on potential future commercial sales related to three ICE molecules and pre-loaded natural killer cells containing the ICE molecules. Additionally, we are eligible to receive a milestone upon the first product candidate in each program achieving marketing approval. Compugen In September 2021, we earned a 0.5 million milestone payment under our license agreement with Compugen triggered by the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1/2 study of AZD2936, a TIGIT/PD-1 bispecific antibody, in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. AZD2936 is derived from COM902 and is being developed by AstraZeneca. In November 2022, we earned a 0.8 million milestone payment under our license agreement with Compugen. Sonnet Biotherapeutics In July 2012, we entered into the Sonnet Collaboration Agreement which was amended in May 2019 to develop various products using Sonnet s ABD platform. Under the terms of the Sonnet Collaboration Agreement, we may receive milestone payments aggregating up to 3.75 million and low single-digit royalties from Sonnet on future commercial sales of such products. In April 2022, Sonnet initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SON-1010 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, and we earned a 0.5 million development milestone from Sonnet. Competition The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Some of the drugs our licensees or milestone and royalty partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our licensees or royalty partners competitors. There can be no assurance that developments by others, including, without limitation, the development of generics or biosimilars, will not render our licensees or royalty partners products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Additionally, our royalty aggregator model faces competition on at least two fronts. First, there are other companies, funds and other investment vehicles seeking to aggregate royalties or provide alternative financing to development-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These competitive companies, funds and other investment vehicles may have a lower target rate of return, a lower cost of capital or access to greater amounts of capital and thereby may be able to acquire assets that we are also targeting for acquisitions. Second, existing or potential competitors to our partners and licensees products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Table of Contents 
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners and licensees, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. Further, various state and federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and state and federal data privacy and security law, may also apply. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. Development stage products in our portfolio require approval by the FDA before we will recognize any royalties from sales. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. In the United States, the EU and other significant or potentially significant markets for our portfolio and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. In the United States, the volume of drug pricing-related legislation has dramatically increased in recent years. For example, Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturers to refund the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, for certain discarded amounts of drugs from single-use vials beginning in 2023 and eliminating the existing cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024. Also, in August 2022 Congress enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate Medicare prices for certain drugs, imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B and D utilization, restructures the Medicare Part D benefit and increases manufacturer contributions in some or all of the Medicare Part D benefit phases. In addition, many state legislatures are considering, or have already passed into law, legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as requiring manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, creating review boards for prices to state agencies, and encouraging the use of generic drugs. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Further, many countries outside the United States, including the EU member states, have established complex and lengthy procedures to obtain price approvals and coverage reimbursement and periodically review their pricing and reimbursement decisions. If any pricing-related regulation impacts products in our portfolio, it would result in lower royalties received by us. We believe there are no compliance issues with laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have adversely affected, or are reasonably expected to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we currently do not anticipate material capital expenditures arising from environmental regulation. We believe climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements and the risk of disruptions to our business. We do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Intellectual Property Intellectual property is important to our business and our future income streams will depend in part on our partners and licensees , ability to obtain issued patents and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our, or our partners

 or licensees patents will afford protection against competitors with similar products or that others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our, or our partners or licensees patent applications. Some of our agreements, or those of our partners or licensees, contain step-down provisions where the royalty rate is reduced following patent expiration or revocation.

Our principal executive offices are located at 2200 Powell Street, Suite 310, Emeryville, California 94608. Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is (510) 204-7200. Our website address is www.xoma.com . The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose risks to our business as clinical trials industry-wide have slowed. Our business is dependent on the continued development and commercialization efforts of our licensees and our royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees. We have been monitoring and continue to monitor our portfolio programs for potential delays in underlying research programs and elections of our partners to continue or cease development. Delays in clinical trials and underlying research programs may lead to delayed revenue from milestones from our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties or, if certain research programs are discontinued, we may recognize impairment charges for our royalty receivables. COVID-19 and the related variants may impact our underlying programs in a variety of ways which are unknown in length and scope at this time. Employees We rely on a small number of skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. As of March 6, 2023, we employed 12 full-time employees and one part-time employee primarily engaged in executive, business development, legal, finance and administrative positions. We also utilize independent contractors and consultants to supplement our workforce. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to our Royalty Aggregator Strategy Our acquisitions of potential future royalty and/or milestone payments may not produce anticipated revenues and/or may be negatively affected by a default or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) under the applicable license agreement(s) covering such potential royalties and/or milestones, and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able to recuperate our capital expenditures associated with the acquisition. We are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire future royalties, milestones and other payments related to drug development and sales as part of our royalty aggregator strategy or to acquire companies that hold royalty assets. Generally, at any time, we seek to have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions. Many potential acquisition targets do not meet our criteria, and for those that do, we may face significant competition for these acquisitions from other royalty buyers and enterprises. Competition for future asset acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for such assets and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. The 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 success of our acquisitions is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, probability, timing and amount of potential future royalty and milestone payments as well as the viability of the underlying technology and intellectual property. The failure of any of these acquisitions to produce anticipated revenues may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these acquisitions may expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) that are parties to the applicable license agreement(s) covering the potential milestone and royalty streams being acquired. In addition, recent volatility in the capital markets may limit our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties ability to access additional funding. While we generally try to structure our receipt of potential milestone and royalty payments to minimize the risk associated with such a default or bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that any such default or bankruptcy will not adversely affect our ability to receive future potential royalty and/or milestone payments. To mitigate this risk, on occasion, we may obtain a security interest as collateral in such royalty, milestone and other payments. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the agreements covering the particular assets. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recuperate our full capital outlay. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Many of our potential royalty acquisitions may be associated with drug products that are in clinical development and have not yet been commercialized. To the extent that such products are not successfully developed and commercialized, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Acquisitions of potential royalties associated with development stage biopharmaceutical product candidates are subject to a number of uncertainties. As part of our royalty aggregator strategy, we may continue to purchase future potential milestone and royalty streams associated with drug products which are in clinical development and have not yet received marketing approval by any regulatory authority or been commercialized. There can be no assurance that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities will approve such products or that such products will be brought to market timely or at all, or that the market will be receptive to such products. To the extent that any such drug products are not successfully developed and subsequently commercialized, the value of our acquired potential milestone and royalty streams will be negatively affected. The ultimate success of our royalty aggregator strategy will depend on our ability to properly identify and acquire high quality products and the ability of the applicable counterparty to innovate, develop and commercialize their products, in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. Their inability to do so would negatively affect our ability to receive royalty and/or milestone payments. In addition, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit, such as protection of a patent estate, adequate reporting and other protections, and their failure to do so would presumably negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authority approves a development-stage product candidate that generates our royalty, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the developers of these development-stage product candidates may not be able to raise additional capital to continue their discovery, development and commercialization activities, which may cause them to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of their clinical trials or research and development programs. If other product developers introduce and market products that are more effective, safer, less invasive or less expensive than the relevant products that generate our royalties, or if such developers introduce their products prior to the competing products underlying our royalties, such products may not achieve commercial success and thereby result in a loss for us. Further, the developers of such products may not have sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If no sales, marketing or distribution arrangements can be made on acceptable terms or at all, the affected product may not be able to be successfully commercialized, which will result in a loss for us. Losses from such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We intend to continue, and may increase, this strategy of acquiring development-stage product candidates. While we believe that we can readily evaluate and gain conviction about the likelihood of a development-stage product candidate s approval and achieving significant sales, there can be no assurance that our assumptions will prove correct, that regulatory authorities will approve such development-stage product candidates, that such development-stage product candidates will be brought to market timely or at all, or that such products will achieve commercial success. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may in the future, adversely affect our and our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which could cause delays or elimination of our receipts of potential milestones and royalties under our licensing or royalty and milestone acquisition arrangements. The global spread of COVID-19 and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises has adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact in the future our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which has and could further cause delays, suspensions or cancellations of their drug development efforts including, without limitation, their clinical trials, which would correspondingly delay, suspend or negate the timing of our potential receipts of milestones and royalties under our out-licensing or royalty acquisition agreements. The disruptions to our licensees or RPA counterparties or their licensees could include, without limitation: delays or difficulties in recruiting and enrolling new patients in their clinical trials; delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation; diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as their clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of their clinical trials; interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring; limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of their clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial supplies and materials; potential refusal by the FDA to accept data, including from clinical trials in affected geographies or failure to comply with updated FDA guidance and expectations related to the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic; and delays in receiving approval from the FDA, the EMA and other U.S. and foreign federal, state and local regulatory authorities to initiate their planned clinical trials or to market their products. 
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and prospects and the overall economies of the United States and other countries will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic and mutations in the COVID-19 virus. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business related activities have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, and manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended. In addition, quarantines, stay-at-home, executive and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations continue to impact personnel at third-party clinical testing sites, manufacturing 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 facilities, and the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our licensees and RPA counterparties and their licensees supply chains. The spread of COVID-19, which has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets, may materially affect us economically. While the evolving economic impacts brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. While several of our partners have experienced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could continue to have an impact on our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in future periods. Risks Related to our Industry Biopharmaceutical products are subject to sales risks. Biopharmaceutical product sales may be lower than expected due to a number of reasons, including pricing pressures, insufficient demand, product competition, failure of clinical trials, lack of market acceptance, obsolescence, loss of patent protection, government regulations, the impact of COVID-19 or other factors, and development-stage product candidates may fail to reach the market. Unexpected side effects, safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to a product, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, declining sales or litigation. As a result, payments of our future potential milestones and/or royalties may be reduced or cease. In addition, these potential payments may be delayed, causing our near-term financial performance to be weaker than expected. Biopharmaceutical products are subject to substantial competition. The biopharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The length of any product s commercial life cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that one or more products on which we are entitled to a potential milestone or royalty will not be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products or improvements on which we are not entitled to a potential milestone or royalty, either by the current marketer of such products or by another marketer. Current marketers of products may undertake these development efforts in order to improve their products or to avoid paying our royalty. Adverse competition, obsolescence or governmental and regulatory action or healthcare policy changes could significantly affect the revenues, including royalty-related revenues, of the products which generate our potential milestones and royalties. Competitive factors affecting the market position and success of each product include: effectiveness; safety and side effect profile; price, including third-party insurance reimbursement policies; timing and introduction of the product; effectiveness of marketing strategy and execution; governmental regulation;

Table of Contents 
 availability of lower-cost generics and/or biosimilars; treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for a product; and product liability claims. 
 Biopharmaceutical products that have the potential to generate future milestones and royalties for us may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products, including generics and/or biosimilars, improvements on existing products or governmental or regulatory action. In addition, as biopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies using gene editing and new curative modalities, such as cell and gene therapy, products on which we have a milestone or royalty rights may become obsolete. These developments could have a material adverse effect on the sales of the biopharmaceutical products that have potential to generate our milestones and royalties, and consequently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty and milestone payments. While we typically have primary or back-up rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies, if available, to resolve any disputes resulting from any such audit. The royalty, milestone and other payments we may receive are dependent on our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees achievement of regulatory and developmental milestones and product sales. Each licensee s calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee and/or a licensee may fail to report the achievement of royalties or milestones in whole or in part. Our license and royalty agreements typically provide us the primary or back-up right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on our part. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process. Although we intend to regularly exercise our royalty audit rights as necessary and to the extent available, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report the achievement of milestones and royalty sales and calculate and pay applicable milestones and royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty and other audit rights, we rely on licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to incur expenses to exercise legal remedies, if available, to enforce our agreements. The lack of liquidity of our acquisitions of future potential milestones and royalties may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price, if at all. As a result, we may suffer losses. We generally acquire milestone and royalty rights that have limited secondary resale markets and may be subject to transfer restrictions. The illiquidity of most of our milestone and royalty receivable assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price if at all and, as a result, we may suffer losses if we are required to dispose of any or all such assets in a forced liquidation or otherwise. In addition, if we liquidate all or a portion of our potential future milestone and/or purchased royalty stream interests quickly or relating to a forced liquidation, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these interests. Our royalty aggregator strategy may require that we register with the SEC as an investment company in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rules and interpretations of the SEC and the courts, relating to the definition of investment company are very complex. While we currently intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be an investment company under 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 applicable SEC interpretations, we can provide no assurance that the SEC would not take the position that the Company would be required to register under the 40 Act and comply with the 40 Act s registration and reporting requirements, capital structure requirements, affiliate transaction restrictions, conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors, and other substantive provisions. We monitor our assets and income for compliance under the 40 Act and seek to conduct our business activities to ensure that we do not fall within its definitions of investment company or that we qualify under one of the exemptions or exclusions provided by the 40 Act and corresponding SEC regulations. If we were to become an investment company and be subject to the restrictions of the 40 Act, those restrictions likely would require significant changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative costs and burdens to our operations. To ensure we do not fall within the 40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring the Company and/or modifying our mixture of assets and income or a liquidation of certain of our assets. Our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees could be subject to natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events that could hinder or disrupt development efforts. We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates for which we may receive milestone, royalty and other payments in the future. Our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees operate research and development efforts in various locations in the United States and internationally. If any of their facilities is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, labor disputes or strikes, other conflict, or other events outside of their control, their research and development efforts could be disrupted, which could result in the delay or discontinuation of development of one or more of the product candidates in which we have rights to future milestone and/or royalty payments which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. Because many of the companies with which we do business also are in the biotechnology sector, the volatility of that sector can affect us indirectly as well as directly. The same factors that affect us directly also can adversely affect us indirectly by affecting the ability of our partners and others with whom we do business to meet their obligations to us and reduce our ability to realize the value of the consideration provided to us by these other companies in connection with their licensing of our products. Risks Related to our Financial Results and Capital Requirements We have sustained losses in the past, and we expect to sustain losses in the foreseeable future. We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Although we generated net income of 15.8 million and positive cash flows from operations of 22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated net loss of 17.1 million and negative cash flows from operations of 12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. We do not know whether we will ever achieve sustained profitability or whether cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to meet our needs. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt and royalty interests, and payments received under our collaboration and licensing arrangements. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our and our partners ability to generate revenues. If our partners product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following regulatory approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent in large part on the success of our and our partners ability to license product candidates, and the success of our partners development programs, both of which are uncertain. Our success is also dependent on our partners obtaining regulatory approval to market product candidates which may not materialize or prove to be successful.

 Unstable market and global economic conditions may have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price. The global credit and financial markets have experienced volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in interest rates, and economic inflation, which has included diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, high inflation, uncertainty about economic stability and changes in unemployment rates. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, acts of terrorism or other geopolitical events. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, may also continue to adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could heighten market and economic instability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our royalty aggregator strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price. Our royalty aggregator strategy may require us to raise additional funds to acquire milestone and royalty interests; we cannot be certain that funds will be available or available at an acceptable cost of capital, and if they are not available, we may be unsuccessful in acquiring milestone and royalty interests to sustain the business in the future. We may need to commit substantial funds to continue our business, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult and more costly. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us and/or result in dilution to our stockholders, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement, as amended and to our 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement. If we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or enter into a license arrangement for a product candidate at an earlier stage of development or for a lesser amount than we might otherwise choose. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may: reduce or eliminate royalty aggregation efforts; further reduce our capital or operating expenditures; curtail our spending on protecting our intellectual property; or take other actions which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in the potential royalty acquisition market, including its structure and participants, or a reduction in the growth of the biopharmaceutical industry, could lead to diminished opportunities for us to acquire potential milestones and royalties, fewer potential milestones and royalties (or potential milestones or royalties of significant scale) being available, or increased competition for potential royalties. Even if we continue to acquire potential royalties and they become actual royalties, they may not generate a meaningful return for a period of several years, if at all, due to the price we pay for such royalties or other factors relating to the underlying products. As a result, we may not be able to continue to acquire potential milestones and royalties as we have in the past, or at all. We have a continuing obligation to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which will be an on-going expenditure for us and may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to 2.15625 per year). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared), before any distribution or payment may be made to holders of shares of common stock or any other class or series of our equity stock ranking, as to liquidation rights, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices ranging from 26.00 per share to 25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, depending on the date of redemption. Holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375 of the 25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock 25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to 2,093.75 per year per share or 2.09375 per year per depositary share). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends are payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices ranging from 26,000.00 per share 26.00 per depositary share) to 25,000.00 per share 25.00 per depositary share), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, depending on the date of redemption. The payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is determined after considering current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities can reduce net earnings and stockholders equity. A deficit in stockholders equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Delaware law. On the other hand, our continued obligation to pay dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in Series B Preferred Stock could restrict us from additional borrowings or make them more costly. The holders of preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of 25,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock 25.00 per depositary share), plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Our preferred stock is senior to our shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our common stockholders. Information available to us about the biopharmaceutical products underlying the potential royalties we buy may be limited and therefore our ability to analyze each product and its potential future cash flow may be similarly limited. We may have limited information concerning the products generating the future potential milestones and royalties we are evaluating for acquisition. Often following our acquisition, the information we have regarding products underlying a potential milestone or royalty may be limited to the information that is available in the public domain. Therefore, there may be material information that relates to such products that we would like to know but do not have and may not be able to obtain. For example, we do not always know the results of studies conducted by sponsors of the products of others or the nature or number of any complaints from doctors or users of such products. In addition, the market data that we obtain independently may also prove to be incomplete or incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the actual potential cash flow from a potential royalty may be significantly lower than our estimates.

Table of Contents 
 Our future income is dependent upon numerous potential milestone and royalty-specific assumptions and, if these assumptions prove not to be accurate, we may not achieve our expected rates of returns. Our business model is based on multiple-year internal and external forecasts regarding potential product sales and numerous product-specific assumptions in connection with each potential milestone and royalty acquisition, including where we have limited information regarding the product. There can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying our financial models, including those regarding potential product sales or competition, patent expirations or license terminations for the products underlying our portfolio, are accurate. These assumptions involve a significant element of subjective judgment and may be and in the past have been adversely affected by post-acquisition changes in market conditions and other factors affecting the underlying product. Our assumptions regarding the financial stability or operational or marketing capabilities of the partner obligated to pay us potential royalties may also prove to be incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the assets in our current portfolio or future assets may not generate our projected returns or in the time periods we expect. This could negatively impact our results of operation for a given period. Reductions or declines in income from potential milestones and royalties, or significant reductions in potential milestone or royalty payments compared to expectations, or impairments in the value of potential milestones and royalties acquired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. The amount and duration of a royalty usually varies on a country-by-country basis and can be based on a number of factors, such as payments to third party licensors, whether the product is sold singly or in combination, patent expiration dates, regulatory exclusivity, years from first commercial sale of the applicable drug product, the entry of competing generic or biosimilar products, or other terms set out in the contracts governing the royalty. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen positive or negative developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, claims of patent misuse, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing of the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations. If an unexpected reduction in a royalty amount or shortening of a potential royalty term were to occur, it could result in a reduction in potential income from milestones and royalties, a significant reduction in potential milestones and royalty payments compared to expectations, or a permanent impairment of such potential milestones and royalty payments. A large percentage of the calculated net present value of our portfolio is represented by a limited number of products. The failure of any one of these products to move forward in clinical development or commercialization may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Our asset portfolio may not be fully diversified by product, therapeutic area, geographic region or other criteria. Any significant deterioration in the amount or likelihood of receipt of potential cash flows from the top products in our asset portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example, in September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant. In September 2022, after an interim analysis of data, Novartis also decided to discontinue its study of CFZ533 in liver transplant. In addition, should the payor of any future potential milestones or royalties decline to pay such potential milestones and royalties for any reason, such failure may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

 Risks Related to Our Milestone and Royalty Streams We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire potential milestone and royalty streams on other products, product candidates, or programs, or other companies to grow and diversify our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any such products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. To grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify and seek to acquire and/or in-license potential milestone and royalty streams or companies. Future growth through acquisition or in-licensing will depend upon the availability of suitable products, product candidates, programs or companies for acquisition or in-licensing on acceptable prices, terms and conditions. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to acquire rights to them on acceptable terms, or at all. The competition to acquire or in-license rights to promising products, product candidates, programs and companies is fierce, and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources, personnel, and experience than we have. In order to compete successfully in the current business climate, we may have to pay higher prices for assets than may have been paid historically, which may make it more difficult for us to realize an adequate return on any acquisition. Even if we are able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license new products, product candidates, programs or companies, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions through, among other things, due diligence, indemnification and risk allocation, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business. In any event, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or in-licensing for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that a product candidate fails to advance to clinical development, proves not to be safe or effective in clinical trials, or that a product fails to reach its forecasted commercial potential or that the integration of a product, product candidate, program or company gives rise to unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our business. If our potential royalty providers therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our potential royalty providers will be unable to market them. Our potential royalty providers product candidates cannot be manufactured and marketed in the United States or any other countries without required regulatory approvals. The U.S. government and governments of other countries extensively regulate many aspects of our partners product candidates, including: clinical development and testing; manufacturing; labeling; storage; record keeping; promotion and marketing; and importing and exporting.

 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Initiation of clinical trials requires approval by health authorities. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices and the European Clinical Trials Directive, as applicable, under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Other national, foreign and local regulations also may apply. The developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization and controls of the product before administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials. This requires developing approved assays of the product to test before administration to the patient and during the conduct of the trial. In addition, developers of pharmaceutical products must provide periodic data regarding clinical trials to the FDA and other health authorities, and these health authorities may issue a clinical hold upon a trial if they do not believe, or cannot confirm, that the trial can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the trial participants. The results of the preclinical studies and clinical testing, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA and other health authorities in the form of a NDA for a drug, and in the form of a BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA or foreign health authorities may grant marketing approvals, request additional information or further research, or deny the application if they determine the application does not satisfy regulatory approval criteria. Regulatory approval of an NDA, BLA, or supplement is never guaranteed. The approval process can take several years, is extremely expensive and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Our potential royalty providers ultimately may not be able to obtain approval in a timely fashion or at all. The FDA and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion in the drug and biologics approval processes. Despite the time and expense incurred, failure can occur at any stage, and our potential development partners could encounter problems that cause abandonment of clinical trials or cause them to repeat or perform additional preclinical, clinical or manufacturing-related studies. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in, or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in both the product approval process and manufacturing facility approval process, and as a result of this discretion and uncertainties about outcomes of testing, we cannot predict at what point, or whether, the FDA or other regulatory agencies will be satisfied with our licensees submissions or whether the FDA or other regulatory agencies will raise questions that may be material and delay or preclude product approval or manufacturing facility approval. In light of this discretion and the complexities of the scientific, medical and regulatory environment, our or our potential royalty providers interpretation or understanding of the FDA s or other regulatory agencies requirements, guidelines or expectations may prove incorrect, which also could delay further or increase the cost of the approval process. Our potential milestone and royalty providers face uncertain results of clinical trials of product candidates. Drug development has inherent risk, and our potential milestone and royalty providers are required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target profiles before they can seek regulatory approvals for commercial use. It is possible our potential royalty providers may never receive regulatory approval for any licensed product candidates. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the resulting product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates require significant additional research and development, extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. This process is lengthy and expensive, often taking a number of years. As clinical results frequently are susceptible to varying 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly. As a result, it is uncertain whether: our potential milestone and royalty providers future filings will be delayed; our potential milestone and royalty providers preclinical studies will be successful; our potential milestone and royalty providers will be successful in generating viable product candidates; we will be successful in finding collaboration and licensing partners to advance our product candidates on our behalf; our potential milestone and royalty providers will be able to provide necessary data; results of future clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers will justify further development; or our potential milestone and royalty providers ultimately will achieve regulatory approval for product candidates in which we have an interest. 
 The timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes, including failure to complete preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials in a timely manner, inability to engage contract research organizations and other service providers, scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, changes in key personnel at clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria and shortages of available drug supply. In addition, since we and our royalty agreement counterparties license our product candidates to others to fund and conduct clinical trials, we, and they, have limited control over how quickly and efficiently such licensees advance those trials. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the concentration of patients in specialist centers, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments. Regardless of the initial size or relative complexity of a clinical trial, the costs of such trial may be higher than expected due to increases in duration or size of the trial, changes in the protocol under which the trial is being conducted, additional or special requirements of one or more of the healthcare centers where the trial is being conducted, or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the trial or in the standards or guidelines for approval of the product candidate being tested or for other unforeseen reasons. In addition, our potential milestone and royalty providers may conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, which may subject them to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign clinical research organizations, and may expose our potential milestone and royalty providers to risks associated with foreign currency transactions to make contract payments denominated in the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted. New products and technologies of other companies may render some or all of our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete. New developments by others may render our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Technologies developed and utilized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are changing continuously and substantially. Competition in antibody-based technologies is intense and is expected to increase in the future as a number of established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies advance in these fields. In addition, as biopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies using gene editing and new curative modalities, such as cell and gene therapy, products on which we have a milestone or royalty rights may become obsolete. Many of these competitors may 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our potential milestone and royalty providers for many reasons, including that they may have: significantly greater financial resources; larger research and development staffs; entered into arrangements with, or acquired, biotechnology companies to enhance their capabilities; or extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials. 
 These factors may enable others to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own or those of our potential milestone and royalty providers. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or, for other reasons, later. As a result, we and our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to track development of competitive products, particularly at the early stages. Positive developments in connection with a potentially competing product may have an adverse impact on our future potential for receiving revenue derived from development milestones and royalties. For example, if another product is perceived to have a competitive advantage, or another product s failure is perceived to increase the likelihood that our licensed product will fail, our potential milestone and royalty providers may halt development of product candidates in which we have an interest. Our potential royalty providers may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for sales of our products, which would prevent our potential royalty providers products from becoming profitable and negatively affect the royalties we may receive. If our potential royalty providers succeed in bringing our product candidates to the market, they may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow our potential royalty providers to sell the products on a competitive basis. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which our potential royalty providers may obtain regulatory approval. Even if coverage is available, the associated reimbursement rate may not be adequate for our potential royalty providers to cover related marketing costs. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, the process of obtaining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly. Thus, even if our partners product candidates are approved by the FDA, our royalty partners may not be able to price the products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for their products, which could adversely affect the royalties we receive. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Our business is affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government controls on pricing. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. We cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals or managed care efforts may have on our or our potential milestone and royalty providers businesses.

 We do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. Even if product candidates in which we have an interest receive approval in the future, they may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, our potential royalty providers may experience difficulties in launching new products, many of which are novel and based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community. We have no assurance healthcare providers and patients will accept such products, if developed. Similarly, physicians may not accept a product if they believe other products to be more effective or more cost effective or are more comfortable prescribing other products. Furthermore, government agencies, as well as private organizations involved in healthcare, from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients. Such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect product usage directly (for example, by recommending a decreased dosage of a product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy) or indirectly (for example, by recommending a competitive product over a product in which we have an ownership or royalty interest). Consequently, we do not know if physicians or patients will adopt or use products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest for their approved indications. Even approved and marketed products are subject to risks relating to changes in the market for such products. Introduction or increased availability of generic or biosimilar versions of products can alter the market acceptance of branded products. In addition, unforeseen safety issues may arise at any time, regardless of the length of time a product has been on the market which may lead to litigation, increased costs and delays or removal of the product from the market. We are exposed to an increased risk of product liability claims. The testing, marketing and sales of medical products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability. In the event of one or more large, unforeseen awards of damages against us, our product liability insurance may not provide adequate coverage. A significant product liability claim for which we were not adequately covered by insurance or indemnified by a third party would have to be paid from cash or other assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the value of our common stock. To the extent we have sufficient insurance coverage, such a claim would presumably result in higher subsequent insurance rates. In addition, product liability claims can have various other ramifications, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, including loss of future sales opportunities, discontinuation of clinical trials, increased costs associated with replacing products, a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, costs to defend litigation, and divert our management s attention from our business, each of which could also adversely affect our business and operating results. If we and our potential royalty providers are unable to protect our intellectual property, in particular patent protection for principal products, product candidates and processes in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and prevent the use of the covered subject matter by third parties, our potential royalty providers ability to compete in the market will be harmed, and we may not realize our profit potential. We and our potential royalty providers rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products or product candidates. However, these means may afford only limited protection and may not: prevent our competitors from duplicating our products and those of our potential royalty providers ; prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology and that of our potential royalty providers ; or permit us or our potential royalty providers to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. 
 Because of the length of time and the expense associated with bringing new products to the marketplace, we and our potential royalty providers hold and are in the process of applying for a number of patents in the United States and abroad to protect product candidates and important processes and also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the mere issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. The U.S. Federal Courts, the U.S. Patent Trademark Office or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. The America Invents Act introduced post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us or our licensees may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. A decision in such proceedings adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our, and our potential royalty providers intellectual property rights are not protected adequately, our potential royalty providers may not be able to commercialize technologies or products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and their competitors could commercialize such technologies or products, which could result in a decrease in our potential royalty providers sales and market share that would harm our business and operating results. Specifically, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards governing the validity of biotechnology patents are in transition, and current defenses as to issued biotechnology patents may not be adequate or available in the future. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to: whether any pending or future patent applications held by us or our potential royalty providers will result in an issued patent, or whether issued patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies; whether competitors will be able to design around our or our potential royalty providers patents or develop and obtain patent protection for technologies, designs or methods that are more effective than those covered by our or our potential royalty providers patents and patent applications; or the extent to which our or our potential royalty providers product candidates could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to costly litigation, result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, reduce the royalty rate due to us, and prevent our potential royalty providers from using our technology or product candidates. 
 If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our potential royalty providers may require licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or may trigger contractual royalty offset clauses in our license agreements, or those of our royalty-agreement counterparties. We may become involved in litigation to determine the proprietary rights of others, and any such litigation will presumably be costly, time consuming, may not be adequately covered by insurance and may have other adverse effects on our business, such as inhibiting our potential royalty providers ability to compete in the marketplace and absorbing significant management time. Due to the uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents, we also have relied and will continue to rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our employees and contractors are typically required to sign confidentiality agreements under which they agree not to use or disclose any of our proprietary information. Research and development contracts and relationships between us and our scientific consultants and potential licensees provide access to aspects of our know-how that are protected generally under confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality agreements may be breached or may not be enforced by a court. To the extent proprietary information is divulged to competitors or to the public generally, such disclosure may adversely affect our licensees ability to develop or commercialize our products by giving others a competitive advantage or by undermining our patent position. In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and or applications will be due to the U.S. and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our and our licensees patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 outside patent annuity service to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the U.S. and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. No assurance can be given that our, or our partners or licensees patents will be extended upon expiration, which may have an effect on our financial condition and results of operation. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology and have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the life of a patent, and thus the protection it affords, is limited. Significant patents in our portfolio will expire in the coming years and while various extensions may be available, on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, continuous patent protection is not guaranteed. While we expect to seek, and expect our partners to seek, extensions of patent terms for issued patents where available and when necessary, failure to secure patent extensions may have an effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation regarding intellectual property and/or the enforcement of our contractual rights against licensees and third parties can be costly and expose us to risks of counterclaims against us. From time to time, we are required to engage in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings to protect our intellectual property and/or enforce our contractual rights against former or current licensees or third parties, including third-party collaborators of such licensees. The cost to us of complex proceedings of this type, even if resolved in our favor, can be substantial, and the parties opposing us in such proceedings may be able to sustain the cost of such proceedings more effectively than we can if they have substantially greater resources than we have. Any such proceedings and any negotiations leading up to them also may be time-consuming and can divert management s attention and resources. If a proceeding of this type is resolved against us, we may lose the value associated with contract rights contained in our arrangements with licensees and third parties, the patents that are the subject of such proceeding may be declared invalid, we could be exposed to counterclaims against us, and we could be held liable for significant damages, fees and/or costs. While it is our current plan to continue to review and pursue, on a selective basis, potential material contractual breaches against licensees and third parties (including third-party collaborators of licensees) and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights or technology, there can be no assurance that any such enforcement actions will be successful, or if successful, the timing of such success or that we will have sufficient capital to prosecute any such actions to a successful conclusion. In June 2021, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of our licensees (the Licensee with the American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution. We believe that the Licensee violated the terms of our License Agreement (the License Agreement and that we are entitled to milestone and royalty payments under the License Agreement, and that the Licensee impermissibly attempted to sublicense our licensed patent rights. We also seek damages and fees and costs of the arbitration (which fees and costs are currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). In response, the Licensee seeks declarations that the License Agreement, under our interpretation, is unlawful, void and unenforceable, and that the License Agreement has expired. To date, the Licensee has not filed any counterclaims against us. However, to the extent the Licensee is deemed to be the prevailing party, the arbitrators, in their discretion, may require us to pay the Licensee s fees and costs of the arbitration (currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). A hearing before a panel of arbitrators was held on this matter in November 2022, and the parties have submitted post-hearing briefs. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we, or our licensees, are infringing other parties patents. If such claims are resolved against us, we or our licensees may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing products, processes or services unless we obtain a license from the other party. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, thus preventing us, or our licensees, from using these products, processes or services and adversely affecting our potential future revenue.

 Uncertainties resulting from our participation in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings involving intellectual property and/or contractual rights could have a material adverse effect on our or our partners ability to compete in the marketplace. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the perceived value of the drug product candidates as to which we hold potential milestone or royalty interests, or intellectual property or contractual rights could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of litigation, arbitration or other proceedings involving intellectual property and/or contractual rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties We and our partners rely heavily on license and collaboration relationships, and any disputes or litigation with our partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us, including our ability to receive milestone payments and future potential royalty and other revenues. License or collaboration agreements relating to products may, in some instances, be unilaterally terminated or disputes may arise which may affect our potential milestones, royalties and other payments. License or collaboration agreements relating to the products generating our future potential milestones and royalties and other payment rights may be terminated, which may adversely affect sales of such products and therefore the potential payments we may receive. For example, under certain license or collaboration agreements, marketers may retain the right to unilaterally terminate the agreements. When the last patent covering a product expires or is otherwise invalidated in a country, a marketer may be economically motivated to terminate the applicable license or collaboration agreement, either in whole or with respect to such country, in order to terminate its payment and other obligations. In the event of such a termination, a licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator may no longer receive all of the payments it expected to receive from the applicable licensee or collaborator and may also be unable to find another company to continue developing and commercializing the product on the same or similar terms as those under the license or collaboration agreement that has been terminated. In addition, license or collaboration agreements may fail to provide significant protection for the applicable licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator in case of the applicable licensee s or collaborator s failure to perform or in the event of disputes. License and collaboration agreements which relate to the products underlying our potential future milestones, royalties and other payment rights, are complex and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property, royalty terms, payment rights or other contractual terms subject to a license or collaboration agreement, including: the scope or duration of rights granted under the license or collaboration agreement and other interpretative issues; the amounts or timing of royalties, milestones or other payments due under the license or collaboration agreement; the sublicensing of patent or other rights under our license or collaboration relationships; the diligence obligations under the license or collaboration agreement and what activities satisfy such diligence obligations: the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us or our partners; and the priority of invention of patented technology. 
 The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what the licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator believes to be the scope of its rights to the relevant 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 intellectual property or technology, or decrease the licensee s or collaborator s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, any of which could in turn impact the value of our potential royalties, milestones and other payments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a marketer were to default on its obligations under a license or collaboration agreement, the licensor s or collaborator s remedy may be limited either to terminating certain licenses or collaborations related to certain countries or to generally terminate the license or collaboration agreement with respect to such country. In such cases, we may not have the right to seek to enforce the rights of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) and we may be required to rely on the resources and willingness of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) to enforce its rights against the applicable licensee or collaborator. In any of these situations, if the expected upfront, milestone, royalty or other payments under the license or collaboration agreements do not materialize, this could result in a significant loss to us and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions with its licensees or collaborators regarding the interpretation of the payment and other provisions relating to products as to which we have milestones and potential royalty or other payment rights. Should any such discussions result in a disagreement regarding a particular product that cannot be resolved satisfactorily to us, we may end up being paid less than anticipated on such product should it successfully progress through clinical development and be approved for commercialization. Should our milestone and future potential royalty or other payment interests be reduced or eliminated as a result of any such disagreement, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. Our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful, and we may be unable to enter into future arrangements to develop and commercialize our unpartnered assets. Generally, our current collaborative partners have the right to terminate their collaborations at will or under specified circumstances. If any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully (for example, by not making required payments when due, or at all or failing to engage in commercially reasonable efforts to develop products if required), our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated. Our potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third parties to provide services in connection with their product candidate development and manufacturing programs. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidate development. Third parties provide services in connection with preclinical and clinical development programs, including in vitro and in vivo studies, assay and reagent development, immunohistochemistry, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trial support, manufacturing and other outsourced activities. If these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which our potential milestone and royalty providers have contracted, or cease to continue operations, and our potential milestone and royalty partners are not able to find a replacement provider quickly or lose information or items associated with their drug product candidates, our potential milestone and royalty providers development programs and receipt of any potential resulting income may be delayed. Agreements with other third parties, many of which are material to our business, expose us to numerous risks and have caused us to incur additional liabilities. Because our licensees, suppliers and contractors are independent third parties, they may be subject to different risks than we are and have significant discretion in, and different criteria for, determining the efforts and resources they will apply related to their agreements with us. If these licensees, suppliers and contractors do not successfully perform the functions for which they are responsible, we may not have the capabilities, resources or rights to do so on our own. We do not know whether we or our licensees will successfully develop and market any of the products that are or may become the subject of any of our licensing arrangements. In addition, third-party arrangements such as ours also increase uncertainties in the related decision-making processes and resulting progress under the arrangements, as we and our licensees may reach different conclusions, or support different paths forward, based on the same information, particularly when large amounts of technical data are involved. In addition, under the contracts with HCRP, the amortization for the reporting period is calculated based on the payments expected to be made by the licensees to HCRP over the term of the arrangement. Any changes to the estimated payments by the licensees to HCRP can result in a material adjustment to revenue previously reported.

 Failure of our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices standards may cause delays in regulatory approval and penalties for noncompliance. Our potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third party manufacturers and such contract manufacturers are required to produce clinical product candidates under cGMP to meet acceptable standards for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale, as applicable. If such standards change, the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our potential milestone and royalty providers drug product candidates on the schedule required for clinical trials or to meet commercial requirements may be affected. In addition, contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with our potential milestone and royalty providers or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce clinical and commercial supplies of our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates. Contract manufacturers are subject to pre-approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer s compliance with these regulations and standards. Any difficulties or delays in contractors manufacturing and supply of our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates or any failure of our potential milestone and royalty providers contractors to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase costs, reduce revenue, make our licensees postpone or cancel clinical trials, prevent or delay regulatory approval by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities, prevent the import and/or export of our potential milestone and royalty providers product candidates, or cause any of our potential milestone and royalty providers products that may be approved for commercial sale to be recalled or withdrawn. Certain of our technologies are in-licensed from third parties, so our and our licensees use of them may be restricted and subject to additional risks. We have licensed technologies from third parties. These technologies include phage display technologies licensed to us in connection with our bacterial cell expression technology licensing program and antibody products. However, our and our licensees and collaborators use of these technologies is limited by certain contractual provisions in the licenses relating to them, and although we have obtained numerous licenses, intellectual property rights in the area of phage display are particularly complex. If we are unable to maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property, we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and for future prospects. Our licensors also may seek to terminate our license, which could cause us and our licensees to lose the right to use the licensed intellectual property and adversely affect our and our licensees ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services. Risks Related to Employees, Location, Data Integrity, and Litigation The loss of, COVID-19 related absence of, or changes in any of our key personnel, could delay or prevent achieving our objectives. Our business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss or COVID-19 related absence of one or more key members of our staff. We currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees. In addition, given our minimal employee base, a COVID-19 outbreak in our employee population could significantly hinder our ability to meet our operating objectives. Changes in management may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. Because we are a small biopharmaceutical focused company with limited resources, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel. We had 12 full-time employees and one part-time employee as of March 6, 2023. We may require additional experienced executive, accounting, legal, administrative and other personnel from time to time in the future. We are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. There is intense competition for the services of these personnel, especially in California.

 Moreover, we expect the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may suffer, and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively. We rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources. Due to our small number of employees, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources, as well as for certain of our functions as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the health care industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future licensees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could be the result of a cyberattacks and could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our development programs and other business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability. If our information technology systems or data or those of our partners or contractors are or were compromised by security incidents, our sensitive information could be exposed or stolen and we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences. Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems, and those of our partners and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our business partners. The secure maintenance and protection of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Threats to our systems and sensitive data can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from a person with authorized access to

 our network, to an individual hacker, to an organized threat actor organization, to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats also may be intentional or accidental. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect cyber incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Data breaches and any unauthorized access to our systems could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. A data security breach could also lead to exposure of personal information of our employees, legacy clinical trial patients, vendors and others, which could expose us to liability under foreign, federal, or state privacy laws. Theft of proprietary information could be used to compete against us and could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. Authorities worldwide have been warning businesses of increased cybersecurity threats from actors seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures that are intended to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent all such cyber incidents. Further, we cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. Compliance with stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security protection is a rigorous and time-intensive process. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with any privacy or data security obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences. Many states, countries and jurisdictions strictly regulate data privacy and protection and may impose significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. For example, in the U.S., the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents and the CPRA which became effective on January 1, 2023, which expands upon the CCPA. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded privacy rights, including the right to request correction, access and deletion of their personal information, the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, and the right to receive detailed information about how their information is processed. The CCPA and CPRA include a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action and will likely impact our business activities, along with increasing our compliance costs and potential liability. If we fail to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws. Compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, data governance and data protection is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations and incur substantial expenditures. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, data incidents experienced by us, our partners or collaborators could lead to significant fines, required corrective action, the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive clinical or commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, partners, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, or prevents access to, patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of: harm to our reputation;

 fines imposed on us by regulatory authorities; additional compliance obligations under federal, state or foreign laws; requirements for mandatory corrective action to be taken by us; and requirements to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data. 
 In addition, cyber incidents can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Lastly, we cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve. Risks Related to Government Regulation Even after FDA approval, a product may be subject to additional testing or significant marketing restrictions, its approval may be withdrawn, or it may be removed voluntarily from the market. Even if our potential royalty providers receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight and review by the FDA and other regulatory entities. The FDA, the EMA, or another regulatory agency may impose, as a condition of the approval, ongoing requirements for post-approval studies or post-approval obligations, including additional research and development and clinical trials, and the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency subsequently may withdraw approval based on these additional trials or obligations. Even for approved products, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and production of such product. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for such products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Furthermore, marketing approval of a product may be withdrawn by the FDA, the EMA or another regulatory agency or such product may be withdrawn voluntarily by our potential royalty providers based, for example, on subsequently arising safety concerns. The FDA, EMA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. Healthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our potential royalty providers ability to sell products in which we have ownership or and royalty interests, if approved, profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors. There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. In addition, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. On August 16, 2022, 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how other such challenges, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1 in 2022 to up to 4 in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently in the U.S. over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs the Secretary of HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D, and subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated maximum fair price under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but it is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, beginning in 2023, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, will require manufacturers to refund CMS for certain discarded amounts of single-dose container and single-use package drugs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, and restrictions on certain product access. In some cases, such legislation and regulations have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. An expansion in the government s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements for providers, and reduced product utilization, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. We cannot know what form any such new legislation may take or the market s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent our potential royalty providers from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, develop, or commercialize our current product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest.

 We and our potential milestone and royalty providers are subject to various state and federal healthcare-related laws and regulations that if violated may impact the commercialization of our product candidates for which we possess milestone or royalty rights or could subject us to significant fines and penalties. Our operations may be directly or indirectly subject to various state and federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and state and federal data privacy and security laws. These laws may impact, among other things, the commercial operations for any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The ACA modified the federal Anti-Kickback Statute s intent requirement so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Certain suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individual, commonly known as a whistleblower , or relator may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend and/or settle a False Claims Act action. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private payor, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information by entities subject to the law, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf. Many states also have adopted laws similar to each of the federal laws described above, some of which apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Additionally, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. Further, some states have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA and differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Because of the breadth of these laws, and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.

Table of Contents 
 If we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable state and federal healthcare laws, we or our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, reputational harm, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we and our licensees may be subject to certain analogous foreign laws and violations of such laws could result in significant penalties. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws including the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by the United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities or our business arrangements with third parties could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices or the business practices of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations or the operations of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, and we or marketers of products that generate our royalties may be required to curtail or restructure operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need

Table of Contents 
 to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements. As we or our potential milestone and royalty providers do more business internationally, we will be subject to additional political, economic and regulatory uncertainties. We or our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to operate successfully in any foreign market. We believe that because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature, international activities will be a significant part of future business activities and when and if we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are able to generate income, a substantial portion of that income will be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. Foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the United States, and an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could put us at a competitive disadvantage or make it uneconomical to proceed with a product or product candidate s development. International sales may be limited or disrupted by many factors, including without limitation: imposition of government controls; export license requirements; political or economic instability; trade restrictions; changes in tariffs; restrictions on repatriating profits; exchange rate fluctuations; and withholding and other taxation. 
 General Risk Factors Our share price may be volatile, and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or our Series B Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price. Additionally, there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. The market prices of biotechnology companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for biotechnology stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our stock price or the existence of an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our common stock has ranged from a high of 32.09 to a low of 15.68. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our Series A Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of 27.09 to a low of 22.14. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our Series B Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of 26.81 to a low of 21.75. Additionally, we have two significant holders of our common stock that could affect the liquidity of our stock and have a significant negative impact on our stock price if the holders were to quickly sell their ownership positions.

 Our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations or an economic downturn. Our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the U.S. financial markets have in the past contributed to, and may continue in the future contribute to, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. Domestic and international equity markets periodically experience heightened volatility and turmoil. These events may have an adverse effect on us. In the event of a market downturn, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. We have issued equity securities and may issue additional equity securities from time to time, that materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock, including our Series X preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. We expect significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in such a manner as we determine from time to time, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement, as amended, and 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our existing securities may be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2022, there were 5,003 shares of Series X preferred stock issued and outstanding. Each share of Series X preferred stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of registered common stock. The total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued Series X preferred stock would be 5,003,000 shares. Each share is convertible at the option of the holder at any time, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting into common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own a number of shares above a conversion blocker, which was initially set at 19.99 of our total common stock then issued and outstanding immediately following the conversion of such shares. A holder of Series X preferred shares may elect to increase or decrease the conversion blocker above or below 19.99 on 61 days notice, provided the conversion blocker does not exceed the limits under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(b), to the extent then applicable. If holders of our Series X convertible preferred stock elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock such conversion would dilute our currently outstanding common stock both in number and in earnings per share. BVF (and its affiliates), as current holders of all shares of our Series X preferred stock, would, if they converted all such shares to common stock, obtain majority voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, BVF owned approximately 31.5 of our total outstanding shares of common stock, and if all of the Series X convertible preferred shares were converted, BVF would own 52.3 of our total outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000 th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, funding from collaboration partners and others has in the past and may in the future involve issuance by us of our common stock. We cannot be certain how the purchase price of such shares, the relevant market price or premium, if any, will be determined or when such determinations will be made. Any issuance by us of equity securities, whether through an underwritten public offering, an at the market offering, a private placement, in connection with a collaboration or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares, and a decrease in the trading price of our securities.

 We may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business. In order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, which would result in dilution to our stockholders and/or debt securities which may impose restrictive covenants that would adversely impact our business. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution or result in other rights or obligations that adversely affect our stockholders. For example, holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to 2.15625 per year). Additionally, holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375 of the 25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock 25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to 2,093.75 per year per share or 2.09375 per year per depositary share). The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to our stockholders and may insulate our management from removal. Our charter and by-laws: require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders, including nominating directors for election at those meetings; and authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the Board of Directors may determine. 
 In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), that may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions of our organizational documents and the DGCL, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock, could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests, and could make it considerably more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace management. As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have determined our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. We can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Companies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the SOX. Section 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), must contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material

 adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. Our ability to use our NOL carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income or taxes may be limited. Our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards could expire unused and/or be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of 108.8 million, of which 13.6 million will begin to expire in 2036. Under the federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited to 80 of current year taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law. In addition, Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or, the Code), and corresponding provisions of state law, generally limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its NOL carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes against any taxable income in taxable periods after the ownership change. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 change, by value, in a corporation s equity ownership over a three-year period. Based on an analysis under Section 382 of Code, we experienced an ownership change in February 2017, that significantly limits the availability of our tax attributes to offset future income. To the extent that we do not utilize our carry forwards within the applicable statutory carry-forward periods, either because of Section 382 limitations or the lack of sufficient taxable income, the carry-forwards will also expire unused. Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations . New tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time. For instance, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act imposes, among other rules, a 15 minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and a 1 excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted differently, changed, repealed, or modified at any time. Any such enactment, interpretation, change, repeal, or modification could adversely affect us, possibly with retroactive effect. In particular, changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of our net deferred tax assets, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act or any future tax reform legislation, could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time charges, and increase our future tax expenses. Stockholder and private lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Securities-related class action and stockholder derivative litigation has often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs. It is possible that suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. These potential lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant time and resources in the defense of these suits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with these lawsuits. Although we carry insurance to protect us from such claims, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position.

 Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions, including any currently pending litigation, are time-consuming for our management, are likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of any future litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of an investment in our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties We currently lease space in one building that houses our corporate headquarters in Emeryville, California. The lease was originally scheduled to expire in February 2023 and in January 2023, we extended the lease through July 2023. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our requirements for the near term and we are currently evaluating our future office space needs. Item 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that we believe to be material. We may, however, be involved in material legal proceedings in the future, and the potential impact on us of any on-going proceeding could change. Such matters are subject to significant uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that any legal proceedings in which we are or may become involved will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview XOMA is a biotech royalty aggregator. We have a sizable portfolio of economic rights to future potential milestone and royalty payments associated with partnered pre-commercial therapeutic candidates. Our portfolio was built through licensing our proprietary products and platforms from our legacy discovery and development business, combined with the acquisition of rights to future milestones and royalties that we have made since our royalty aggregator business model was implemented in 2017. Our drug royalty aggregator business is focused on early to mid-stage clinical assets, primarily in Phase 1 and 2, with significant commercial sales potential that are licensed to large-cap partners. We expect that most of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. The generation of future revenues related to licenses, milestones, and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing licensees. Although we generated net income of 15.8 million and positive cash flows from operations of 22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated net loss of 17.1 million and negative cash flows from operations of 12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The payment we received from Novartis pursuant to our Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement in 2021 was a one-time milestone payment that does not represent recurring revenue. Significant Developments Purchase of IP ObsEva Intellectual Property Acquisition Agreement In November 2022, we entered into the ObsEva IP Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of ObsEva s intellectual property (patents and know-how) and license agreement rights related to ebopiprant, an investigational compound previously licensed by ObsEva from Merck KGaA. We also assumed ObsEva s ongoing obligations under the Organon License Agreement and the Merck KGaA License Agreement. Pursuant to the Organon License Agreement, XOMA is eligible to receive up to 475.0 million in payments for ebopiprant development, commercialization and sales-based milestones. If ebopiprant is successfully commercialized, we will be entitled to receive royalties that range from low to mid-teens from Organon and will be required to make mid-single-digit royalty payments to Merck KGaA. We paid ObsEva a 15.0 million upfront payment at closing and will pay potential earn-out payments of up to 97.5 million for development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, representing a portion of what we will receive pursuant to the Organon License Agreement. Royalty and Commercial Payment Purchase Agreements Commercial Payment Purchase Agreement with Affitech In January 2022, Genentech, a member of the Roche group, received approval from the FDA to commercialize VABYSMO (faricimab-svoa) for the treatment of wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Pursuant to the Affitech CPPA, we paid Affitech a 5.0 million regulatory approval milestone tied to these U.S. marketing approvals. Under the terms of the Affitech CPPA, we are eligible to receive a 0.5 commercial payment stream on net sales of VABYSMO in each of certain regions where it is approved, for a ten-year period following its first commercial sale in such region. In September 2022, in connection with Roche receiving approval from the EC to commercialize VABYSMO for the treatment of neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema, we made a 3.0 million milestone payment to Affitech pursuant to the terms of the Affitech CPPA. As a result of 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 the EC approvals, we will be eligible to receive a 0.5 commercial payment stream for ten years from the first commercial sale of VABYSMO in Europe. VABYSMO was previously approved by the FDA in January 2022 and by Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in March 2022. In August 2022, we received 0.5 million from Roche representing the first commercial payment for sales of VABYSMO during the first six months of 2022, and in February 2023 we received 2.4 million for sales of VABYSMO during the second half of 2022. Kuros Royalty Purchase Agreement In July 2022, we received 2.5 million pursuant to our Kuros RPA. This payment represents 50 of a milestone earned by Kuros upon the closing of Regeneron s acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals on May 31, 2022. License and Collaboration Agreements Compugen In November 2022, we earned a 0.8 million milestone payment under our license agreement with Compugen. Novartis VPM087 In March 2023, Novartis notified us that based upon a strategic review of the development program, Novartis will not initiate further studies of gevokizumab in gastrointestinal cancers. Novartis study to evaluate treatment with gevokizumab with standard of care anti-cancer therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal, gastroesophageal, and renal cancers will continue to primary analysis, which is anticipated later this year. Novartis Anti-CD40 Antibody In September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant. In September 2022, after an interim analysis of data, Novartis also decided to discontinue its study of CFZ533 in liver transplant. Novartis is continuing iscalimab studies in other indications such as Sj gren s Syndrome, Lupus Nephritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Sonnet Collaboration Agreement In April 2022, Sonnet dosed the first patient in its Phase 1 clinical trial for SON-1010, and we earned a development-related milestone payment of 0.5 million from Sonnet pursuant to our Sonnet Collaboration Agreement. Rezolute RZ358 Antibody In January 2022, Rezolute dosed the last patient in its Phase 2b clinical trial for RZ358, we earned a 2.0 million milestone payment pursuant to our Rezolute License Agreement. Modification of Equity Awards In November 2022, we entered into the November 2022 Letter Agreement with Thomas Burns. Pursuant to the November 2022 Letter Agreement, in the event Mr. Burns remains employed by us for a twelve-month period beginning on November 1, 2022, he will be deemed retirement eligible for purposes of his equity awards under the terms of his equity award agreements. All other terms of his amended and restated employment agreement remain the same. Conditioned on his execution of a release in favor of us, Mr. Burns will also receive this benefit upon any involuntary termination for reasons other than cause. This modification resulted in an acceleration of the expense recognized related to Mr. Burns stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of 0.6 million related to the Mr. Burns option awards. As of December 31, 2022, there was 0.5 million total

Table of Contents 
 unrecognized compensation expense related to Mr. Burns stock options expected to be recognized through the earlier of the vesting date of the option or October 31, 2023. Employee Retention Bonus In October 2022, we approved the Amended Retention Plan that amended the Retention Plan to provide that each of our current employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer CEO ), will be eligible to receive a cash retention bonus if employed through each of two periods: (1) the three-month anniversary of November 1, 2022 (the Initial Period and (2) the nine-month period immediately following the Initial Period. All other terms of the Amended Retention Plan remain consistent with the Retention Plan. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to pay 0.8 million in 2023 related to employee retention bonuses under the Amended Retention Plan, of which 0.1 million was accrued in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2022. James R. Neal s Departure and Continuity Incentive Effective December 31, 2022, James R. Neal retired as our Chief Executive Officer and, effective as of January 1, 2023, resigned as a member of our Board and Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to Mr. Neal s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2021, following his departure date, Mr. Neal is entitled to a cash payment of 1.2 million, which will be made in equal monthly installments starting in January 2023 through December 2023, less deductions and withholdings. As of December 31, 2022, we accrued the full amount of Mr. Neal s continuity incentive of 1.2 million in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 30, 2022, the Board appointed Owen Hughes as our Executive Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), effective as of January 1, 2023. Mr. Hughes will receive an annual base salary of 125,000 and will be eligible to receive an annual discretionary cash bonus with a target amount equal to 55 of his annual base salary upon the achievement of annual performance milestones to be established by the Board. On December 30, 2022, the Board also appointed Bradley Sitko as our Chief Investment Officer, effective as of January 3, 2023. Mr. Sitko will receive an annual base salary of 500,000, a signing bonus of 110,000 and will be eligible to receive an annual discretionary cash bonus with a target amount equal to 50 of his annual base salary upon the achievement of annual performance milestones to be established by the Board. Mr. Hughes and Mr. Sitko were also granted non-qualified stock options subject to the terms and conditions of the Company s Amended and Restated 2010 Long Term Incentive and Stock Award Plan. The options were granted outside the Plan as an inducement material to Mr. Hughes and Mr. Sitko entering into employment with us in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Further details of the stock option grants can be found in our Form 8-K filed January 4, 2023. Arbitration Proceeding In June 2021, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of our licensees (the Licensee with the American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution. We seek damages, plus interest, and fees and costs of the arbitration (which fees and costs are currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). In response, the Licensee seeks declarations that the License Agreement, under our interpretation, is unlawful, void and unenforceable, and that the License Agreement has expired. To date, the Licensee has not filed any counterclaims against us. However, to the extent the Licensee is deemed to be the prevailing party, the arbitrators, in their discretion, may require us to pay the Licensee s fees and costs of the arbitration (currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). A hearing before a panel of arbitrators was held on this matter in November 2022, and the parties have submitted post-hearing briefs.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of judgment and/or estimation uncertainty and could have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Purchase of Rights to Future Milestones, Royalties and Commercial Payments We have purchased rights to receive a portion of certain future developmental, regulatory and commercial sales milestones, and royalties on sales of products currently in clinical development. We acquired such rights from various entities and recorded the amount paid for these rights as long-term royalty receivables. We have accounted for the purchased rights as a financial asset in accordance with ASC 310. Receivables We account for milestone and royalty rights related to developmental pipeline products on a non-accrual basis using the cost recovery method. Except for VABYSMO , these developmental pipeline products are non-commercialized, non-approved products that require FDA or other regulatory approval, and thus have uncertain cash flows. The related receivable balances are classified as noncurrent since no payments are probable to be received in the near term. VABYSMO received FDA approval in January 2022, was approved by Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in March 2022 , and was approved by the EU s EC in September 2022 and we do not yet have a foundation upon which to estimate receipts expected to be collected in the near term; therefore, they remain classified as noncurrent until such time an estimate can be made. Under the cost recovery method, any milestone, royalty, or other payment received is recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded receivable balance. When the recorded receivable balance has been fully collected, any additional amounts collected will be recognized as revenue. Contingent Payments We may be obligated to make contingent payments related to certain product development and regulatory approval milestones and sales-based milestones. If the contingent payments fall within the scope of ASC 815, the contingent payments are measured at fair value at the inception of the arrangement, subject to remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Any changes in the estimated fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Impairment Assessment We review these balances for impairment on a quarterly basis using updates from our partners, press releases and public information on clinical trials. If we determine an impairment is necessary, the impairment recorded will be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows, which will rely on assumptions including probability of technical success and discount rate. Changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial statements. No impairment has been recorded as of December 31, 2022.

 Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value-based measurement. The valuation of stock-based compensation awards is determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires highly complex and subjective inputs, such as the expected term of the option and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. Our current estimate of volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price. To the extent volatility in our stock price increases in the future, our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase, thereby increasing stock-based compensation cost recognized in future periods. To establish an estimate of expected term, we consider the vesting period and contractual period of the award and our historical experience of stock option exercises, post-vesting cancellations and volatility. The risk-free rate is based on the yield available on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. We review our valuation assumptions quarterly and, as a result, we likely will update our valuation assumptions used to value stock-based awards granted in future periods utilizing current data. In the future, as additional empirical evidence regarding these input estimates becomes available, we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates. These changes could impact our fair value-based measurement of stock options granted in the future. Changes in the fair value-based measurement of stock awards could materially impact our operating results. Results of Operations Revenues Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows (in thousands): 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Revenue from contracts with customers 4,150 36,518 (32,368) Revenue recognized under units-of-revenue method 1,877 1,642 235 Total revenues 6,027 38,160 (32,133) Revenue from Contracts with Customers Revenue from contracts with customers includes upfront fees, annual license fees and milestone payments related to the out-licensing of our legacy product candidates and technologies. The primary components of revenue from contracts with customers in 2022 were due to milestones earned of 2.0 million pursuant to our Rezolute License Agreement, 0.8 million pursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, 0.8 million pursuant to our license agreement with Compugen and 0.5 million pursuant to our Sonnet Collaboration Agreement. The primary components of revenue from contracts with customers in 2021 were due to milestones earned of 35.0 million under our Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement with Novartis, 0.5 million under our license agreement with Compugen and 0.7 million under our license agreement with Janssen. Revenue recognized under units-of-revenue method Revenues recognized under the units-of-revenue method include the amortization of unearned revenue from the sale of royalty interests to HCRP in 2016. The increase in 2022 compared with 2021 was due to increased sales of products underlying the agreements with HCRP. G A Expenses G A expenses include salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees, and facilities costs. In 2022, G A expenses were 23.2 million compared with 20.5 million in 2021.

Table of Contents 
 The net increase of 2.7 million in 2022 as compared with 2021 was primarily due a 2.6 million increase in salaries and related expenses including the 1.2 million Continuity Incentive accrued in connection with the departure of Mr. Neal, a 0.7 million increase in salaries and wages due to increased headcount and general salary increases, 0.4 million related to bonus payments to Mr. Neal pursuant to his amended employment agreement, and 0.1 million accrued in connection with the employee retention bonus. A 2.3 million increase in consulting and legal costs also contributed to the overall increase. The increases in salaries and related expenses, consulting and legal costs were partially offset by a 2.6 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense for stock options. Other Income (Expense) Interest Expense The 0.5 million interest expense reported for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to our SVB Loan that was repaid in June 2021. There was no interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect no interest expense in 2023 as we have no outstanding loan balances; however if we elect to obtain new debt financing, our interest expense may increase. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table shows the activity in other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Other income (expense), net Investment income 694 35 659 Change in fair value of equity securities (439) (919) 480 Other 40 5 35 Total other income (expense), net 295 (879) 1,174 The change in fair value of equity securities is due to the change in market price of equity securities we own in shares of Rezolute s common stock. Investment income increased 0.7 million compared with the same period in 2021 due to higher market interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a 15,000 income tax benefit and a 0.1 million income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our remaining net deferred tax assets. We had a total of 5.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, none of which would impact our effective tax rate to the extent that we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our unrestricted cash, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of and for each of the periods presented (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (12,879) 22,678 (35,557) Net cash used in investing activities (20,221) (26,500) 6,279 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (4,451) 12,835 (17,286) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (37,551) 9,013 (46,564) Net cash used in operating activities for 2022 was primarily due to our operating expenses of 23.4 million, excluding non-cash expenses of 4.4 million including stock-based compensation of 3.6 million, partially offset by a 2.0 million milestone payment received from Rezolute, a 0.8 million milestone payment received from Takeda and a 0.8 million milestone payment received from Compugen. Our primary source of cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was the 35.0 million milestone payment received from Novartis, partially offset by our operating expenses of 20.6 million excluding non-cash expenses including stock-based compensation of 6.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 20.2 million was primarily due to the 15.2 million paid for the IP acquired pursuant to the ObsEva IP Acquisition Agreement in November 2022 and the 5.0 million and 3.0 million payments for regulatory milestones pursuant to the Affitech CPPA, partially offset by the 2.5 million milestone payment received from Kuros in July 2022 and the 0.5 million commercial payment received from Roche in August 2022 . Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, of 26.5 million was due to our acquisitions under RPAs and a CPPA, including a 13.5 million payment pursuant to the Viracta RPA, a 7.0 million payment pursuant to the Kuros RPA and a 6.0 million payment pursuant to the Affitech CPPA. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, of 4.5 million was primarily due to the payment of dividends on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock of 5.5 million, partially offset by the receipt of net cash provided from the exercise of stock options after related tax payments of 1.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of 12.8 million was primarily due to the receipt of net cash proceeds of 37.1 million from our public offering of Series B Preferred Stock, 1.1 million net cash provided from the exercise of stock options after related tax payments, partially offset by 4.3 million cash used in the principal payments of debt, 17.1 million cash used to extinguish outstanding loans and 3.5 million payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Capital Resources We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had 57.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current cash balance and our ability to control discretionary spending, such as royalty acquisitions, we have evaluated and concluded our financial condition is sufficient to fund our planned operations, commitments, and contractual obligations for a period of at least one year following the filing date of this report. We have primarily financed our operations and acquisitions through the issuance of our common stock, Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, and amounts received as milestone payments under our license agreements. The generation of future revenues related to licenses, milestones, and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing licensees. Milestone payments earned in 2021 and 2022 are not indicative of anticipated milestones in future periods. We may seek additional capital through use of our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement or 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), or through other public or private debt or equity transactions. Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets, should we choose to do so, is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common and preferred stock, which are subject to a number of development and business risks and uncertainties, our creditworthiness and the uncertainty that we would be able to raise such additional capital at a price or on terms that are favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, our business and operations may be adversely affected.

 Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements in the short and long term consist of the following expenditures: Operating expenditures: Our primary uses of cash and operating expenses relate to employee and related costs, consultants to support our administrative and business development efforts, legal and accounting services, insurance, investor relations and IT services. Our planned spending includes costs to satisfy the Continuity Incentive related to the departure of Mr. Neal as CEO in December 2022 and increased personnel-related costs starting in 2023 due to the appointment of our new Executive Chairman and Chief Investment Officer. In response to our prior CEO s intention to retire as announced in December 2021, we implemented a Retention Plan to encourage our employees to remain with the Company through and beyond the new CEO transition period. Our Retention Plan includes a cash stay bonus, effective November 1, 2022, as well as a policy defining benefits upon any involuntary termination for reasons other than cause, which includes minimum severance, COBRA benefits, outplacement services and certain modifications to option awards. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of this Retention Plan. To support our royalty aggregator business model, we engage third parties to assist in our evaluation of potential acquisitions of milestone and royalty streams. Additional operating expenses, including consulting and legal costs, may increase in 2023 in response to an anticipated increase in the volume of acquisition targets evaluated or completed. Our amended headquarters lease expires in July 2023, and we are currently evaluating our office space needs, however, due to our small staff and minimal operating space requirements, we do not expect to incur material incremental costs associated with our current or future building leases. RPAs, CPPAs and IP Acquisitions: A significant component of our business model is to acquire rights to potential future milestone and royalty streams. We expect to continue deploying capital toward these acquisitions in the near and long term. We also have potential contingent consideration of 0.1 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022, for development milestones due under our agreement with Bioasis. We paid Affitech a total of 8.0 million in 2022 for milestones tied to the achievement of regulatory approvals. We have evaluated and concluded our existing capital resources are adequate to meet those needs. We also have potential sales-based milestones that may become due under our agreements with Aronora, Kuros and Affitech as well as non-sales-based milestones, sales-based milestones and sales-based royalty payments that may become due under our agreement with ObsEva. All of these milestones and royalty payments represent a portion of the funds we may receive in the future pursuant to these agreements, and therefore will be fully funded by the related royalty or commercial payment receipts. Collaborative Agreements, Royalties and Milestone Payments : We have committed to make potential future milestone payments and legal fees to third parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones by our licensees. Because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies, aggregating up to 6.3 million (assuming one product per contract meets all milestone events) have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. We are unable to determine precisely when and if our payment obligations under the agreements will become due as these obligations are based on milestone events, the achievement of which is subject to a significant number of risks and uncertainties. All payments due will be funded by a portion of the related milestone or royalty revenue we receive or will be reimbursed by our licensees. Dividends : Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to 2.15625 per share of Series A Preferred Stock per year). Holders of Series B Depositary Shares are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375 of the 25,000 liquidation

 preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock 25.00 per depositary share) per year, which is equivalent to 2,093.75 per year per share of Series B Preferred Stock 2.09375 per year per depositary share). Dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year. Since original issuance, all dividends have been paid as scheduled. We expect to continue making these dividend payments as scheduled using our existing capital resources.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of XOMA Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of XOMA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders equity, and cash flows, for the each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Purchase of Rights to Future Milestones, Royalties and Commercial Payments Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company has purchased rights to receive a portion of certain future developmental, regulatory and commercial sales milestones, royalties and option fees on sales of products currently in clinical development. The carrying value of the long-term royalty and commercial payment receivables milestone and royalty rights is 63.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company accounts for milestone and royalty rights on a non-accrual basis using the cost recovery method. The developmental pipeline products are non-commercialized, non-approved products that require FDA or other regulatory approval, and thus have uncertain cash flows. The commercial payment product has limited available historical sales information, and as such the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount and timing of the commercial 
 F-1 

Table of Contents 
 payments to be received. Management assesses any impairment indicators and changes in expected recoverability of the long-term royalty and commercial payment receivable assets regularly. The determination of impairment indicators requires obtaining and assessing all available information regarding the developmental pipeline products and the commercial payment product as of the Company s financial reporting dates. The Company obtains information through available sources including: 1) updates from the selling party of the milestone and royalty rights, 2) publicly available clinical trial data and news, and 3) public disclosures provided by the research companies developing the products. We identified the accounting evaluation of impairment indicators as a critical audit matter, primarily due to the Company s reliance on third parties to disclose updates to the Company timely for the Company s required financial reporting deadlines. The timing of disclosure to the Company of a change in the use, or intent for future use, of the licenses related to the milestone and royalty rights could have a significant impact on the fair value of milestone and royalty rights and a significant change in fair value could cause a significant impairment. Performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management had appropriately identified impairment indicators involved challenging and complex auditor judgment, including the need to involve more experienced auditors in assessing the completeness of available information and if any available public information represents an impairment indicator as of the Company s financial reporting date. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of assumptions used in the impairment assessment of the long-term royalty receivables included, but were not limited to, the following: Considering the impact of changes in the regulatory environment on management s impairment indicator conclusions. We evaluated the Company s assessment of impairment indicators by developing an independent expectation of impairment indicators through research of third-party disclosures and clinical trial news for programs associated with the milestone and royalty rights and comparing such expectation to those included in the impairment analysis. We inspected the Company s documentation of inquiries and written correspondence to obtain program updates from the selling parties of the milestone and royalty rights throughout the year and through the Company s reporting date. Confirmed with the selling parties of the milestone and royalty rights that complete information known to the selling party regarding the associated research programs was provided timely, completely, and accurately to the Company. /s/ March 9, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 . The straight-line method of amortization represents the Company s best estimate of the distribution of the economic value of the identifiable intangible asset. The intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization will be included in amortization of intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.

Novartis Anti-TGF Antibody (NIS793) On September 30, 2015, the Company and Novartis entered into the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement under which the Company granted Novartis an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license to the Company s anti-transforming growth factor beta TGF antibody program (now NIS793 ). Under the terms of the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, Novartis has worldwide rights to NIS793 and is responsible for the development and commercialization of antibodies and products containing antibodies arising from NIS793. Unless terminated earlier, the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis royalty obligations end. The Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement on an antibody-by-antibody and country-by-country basis or in its entirety on notice. The Company concluded that there were multiple promised goods and services under the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, including the transfer of license, regulatory services and transfer of materials, process and know-how, which were determined to represent combined performance obligation. The Company recognized the entire upfront payment of million as revenue in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss in 2015 as it had completed its performance obligations as of December 31, 2015. The Company was eligible to receive up to a total of million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Novartis achieved a clinical development milestone pursuant to the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, and as a result, the Company earned a million milestone payment. The Company concluded that the development and regulatory milestone payments are solely dependent on Novartis performance and achievement of the specified events. The Company determined that it is not probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal will not occur in future periods for these future payments. Therefore, the remaining development and regulatory milestones are fully constrained and excluded from the transaction price. Any consideration related to commercial milestones (including royalties) will be recognized when the related sales occur as they were determined to relate predominantly to the licenses granted to Novartis and therefore, have also been excluded from the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will update its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained and update the estimated transaction price accordingly. The Company is also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a mid-single-digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate. Novartis obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. In October 2020, the Company earned a million milestone upon the dosing of the first patient in Novartis first NIS793 Phase 2 clinical trial. As specified under the terms of the Anti-TGF Antibody License Agreement, the Company received million in cash, and the remaining balance of million was recognized as a reduction to the Company s debt obligation to Novartis. In October 2021, the Company earned a million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in Novartis first NIS793 Phase 3 clinical trial.

Novartis Anti-IL-1 Antibody (VPM087) On August 24, 2017, the Company and Novartis entered into the Gevokizumab License Agreement under which the Company granted to Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab VPM087 ), a novel anti-Interleukin-1 IL-1 beta allosteric monoclonal antibody and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the Gevokizumab License Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of VPM087 and products containing VPM087. On August 24, 2017, pursuant to a separate agreement (the IL-1 Target License Agreement ), the Company granted to Novartis non-exclusive licenses to its intellectual property covering the use of IL-1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and other diseases and conditions, and an option to obtain an exclusive license (the Exclusivity Option to such intellectual property for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Under the Gevokizumab License Agreement, the Company received total consideration of million for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, million was paid in cash and million (equal to million) was paid by Novartis, on behalf of the Company, to settle the Company s outstanding debt with Les Laboratories Servier Servier (the Servier Loan ). In addition, Novartis extended the maturity date on the Company s debt to Novartis. The Company also received million cash related to the sale of shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price of per share. The fair market value of the common stock issued to Novartis was million, based on the closing stock price of per share on August 24, 2017, resulting in a million premium paid to the Company. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, the Company is eligible to receive up to million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the Gevokizumab License Agreement. The Company is also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from the high single-digits to mid teens. Under the IL-1 Target License Agreement, the Company received an upfront cash payment of million and is eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on canakinumab sales in cardiovascular indications covered by the Company s patents. Should Novartis exercise the Exclusivity Option, the royalties on canakinumab sales will increase to the mid-single-digits. Unless terminated earlier, the Gevokizumab License Agreement and IL-1 Target License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis royalty obligations end. The agreements contain customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the Gevokizumab License Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety on prior written notice to the Company. Under the IL-1 Target License Agreement, Novartis has a unilateral right to terminate the agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety upon a prior written notice. The Gevokizumab License Agreement and IL-1 Target License Agreement were accounted for as arrangement because they were entered into at the same time in contemplation of each other. The Company concluded that there are multiple promised goods and services under the combined arrangement, including the transfer of license to IL-1 beta targeting antibodies, and the transfer of license, know-how, process, materials and inventory related to the VPM087 antibody, which were determined to represent two distinct performance obligations. The Company determined that the

 further performance obligations at that point. At the inception of the arrangement, the Company determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was million, which consisted of the million upfront cash payments, the million Servier Loan payoff and the million premium on the sale of the common stock. The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations based on their standalone selling prices. The Company determined that the nature of the performance obligations is the right to use the licenses as they exist at the point of transfer, which occurred when the transfer of materials, process and know-how, and filings to regulatory authority were completed. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized the entire transaction price of million as revenue upon completion of the delivery of the licenses and related materials, process and know-how and filings to regulatory authority. The Company concluded that the development and regulatory milestone payments are solely dependent on Novartis performance and achievement of specified events. The Company determined that it is not probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal will not occur in future periods for these future payments. Therefore, the development and regulatory milestones are fully constrained and excluded from the transaction price until the respective milestone is achieved. Any consideration related to commercial milestones (including royalties) will be recognized when the related sales occur as they were determined to relate predominantly to the licenses granted to Novartis and therefore, have also been excluded from the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will update its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained and update the estimated transaction price accordingly. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were contract assets or contract liabilities related to this arrangement and of the costs to obtain or fulfill the contract were capitalized. The Company did t recognize any revenue related to this arrangement during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Takeda On November 1, 2006, the Company entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with Takeda under which the Company agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda. Under the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the Company may receive additional milestone payments aggregating up to million relating to TAK-079 (mezagitamab) and TAK-169, and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all products subject to this license. The Company s right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. The Company s right to royalties expires on the later of years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent (or 12 years from first commercial sale if there is significant generic competition post patent-expiration). In February 2009, the Company expanded the existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. The Company may receive milestones of up to million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. The Company s right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. The Company s right to royalties expires on the later of from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.

Under the license agreement, the Company is also eligible to receive royalties ranging from the high single-digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of any commercial product incorporating RZ358. The Company concluded that the development and regulatory milestone payments are solely dependent on Rezolute s performance and achievement of the specified events. The Company determined that it is not probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal will not occur in future periods for these future payments. Therefore, the remaining development and regulatory milestones are fully constrained and excluded from the transaction price until the respective milestone is achieved. Any consideration related to commercial milestones (including royalties) will be recognized when the related sales occur as they were determined to relate predominantly to the licenses granted to Rezolute and therefore, have also been excluded from the transaction price.

In consideration for receiving the license for RZ358, Rezolute agreed to issue shares of its common stock and pay cash to the Company upon the occurrence of Rezolute s financing activities. The license agreement was subsequently amended in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement as amended, the Company received a total of million upon Rezolute s financing and million in installment payments through October 2020. The Company also received shares of Rezolute s common stock (as adjusted for the 1:50 reverse stock split in October 2020).

Janssen Biotech The Company and Janssen were parties to a license agreement which was terminated in 2017. In August 2019, the Company and Janssen entered into a new agreement pursuant to which the Company granted a non-exclusive license to Janssen to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates under the XOMA patents and know-how. Under the new agreement, Janssen made a one-time payment of million to XOMA. Additionally, for each drug candidate, the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments of up to million upon Janssen s achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory approval events. Additional milestones may be due for drug candidates which are the subject of multiple clinical trials. Upon commercialization, the Company is eligible to receive royalty on net sales of each product. Janssen s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue until the eighth-year-and-sixth-month anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The new agreement will remain in effect unless terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties. The Company concluded that the new agreement should be accounted for separately from any prior arrangements with Janssen and that the license grant is the only performance obligation under the new agreement. The Company recognized the entire one-time payment of million as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as it had completed its performance obligation. The Company concluded that the development and regulatory milestone payments are solely dependent on Janssen s performance and achievement of specified events and thus it is not probable that a significant cumulative revenue reversal will not occur in future periods for these future payments. Therefore, the development and regulatory milestones are fully constrained and excluded from the transaction price until the respective milestone is achieved. Any consideration related to royalties will be recognized when the related sales occur as they were determined to relate predominantly to the license granted to Janssen and therefore, have also been excluded from the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will update its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained and update the estimated transaction price accordingly. In May 2021, the Company earned a million milestone from Janssen, upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating one of Janssen s biologic assets. In December 2021, the Company earned a million milestone pursuant to its agreement with Janssen. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were contract assets or contract liabilities related to this arrangement. of the costs to obtain or fulfill the contract were capitalized.

The Company classified the proceeds received from HCRP as unearned revenue, to be recognized as revenue under the units-of-revenue method over the life of the license agreements because of the Company s limited continuing involvement in the Acquisition Agreements. Such limited continuing involvement is related to the Company s undertaking to cooperate with HCRP in the event of litigation or a dispute related to the license agreements.

The Company allocated the total proceeds between the Royalty Sale Agreements based on the relative fair value of expected payments to be made to HCRP under the license agreements. The unearned revenue is being recognized as revenue over the life of the underlying license agreements under the units-of-revenue method. Under this method, amortization for a reporting period is calculated by computing a ratio of the allocated proceeds received from HCRP to the payments expected to be made by the licensees to HCRP over the term of the Acquisition Agreements, and then applying that ratio to the period s cash payment.

With respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, a Delisting Event occurs when, after the original issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, both (i) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are no longer listed on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE or the NYSE American LLC NYSE AMER ), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to Nasdaq, the NYSE or the NYSE AMER, and (ii) we are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, but any Series A Preferred Stock is still outstanding. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash, at a redemption price of 25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the date of redemption. With respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, a Change of Control occurs when, after the original issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing:

We refer to redemption following a Delisting Event or Change of Control as a special optional redemption . If, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date (as defined below) or the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of exercise of any of our redemption rights relating to the Series A Preferred Stock (whether our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below. 

 Conversion . Upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event or a Change of Control, as applicable, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock) to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, into a number of shares of our Common Stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration) per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the lesser of: the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the sum of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference plus the amount of any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable (unless the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable is after a record date for a Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series A Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accumulated and unpaid dividend will be included in this sum) by (2) the Common Stock Price (as defined below); and 1.46071 (i.e., the Share Cap), subject to certain adjustments; and subject, in each case, to certain conditions, including, under specified circumstances, an aggregate cap on the total number of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion and to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration. 
 If, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide a redemption notice, whether pursuant to our special optional redemption right or our optional redemption right, holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not have any right to convert the Series A Preferred Stock, and any Series A Preferred Stock subsequently selected for redemption that has been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable. In the event that the conversion would result in the issuance of fractional shares of Common Stock, we will pay the holder of Series A Preferred Stock cash in lieu of such fractional shares. Except as provided above in connection with a Delisting Event or Change of Control, shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. For purposes of this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, Change of Control Conversion Date means a business day fixed by our board of directors that is not fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of a Change of Control. For purposes of this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock Price for any Change of Control will be: (1) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of our Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock; and (2) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of our Common Stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing prices for our Common Stock on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our Common Stock is then traded (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our Common Stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for our Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if our Common Stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. The Common Stock Price for any Delisting Event will be the average of the closing price per share of our Common Stock on the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Delisting Event. For purposes of this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, Delisting Event Conversion Date means a business day fixed by our board of directors that is not fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of a Delisting Event. 

 Voting Rights. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock generally will have no voting rights. However, if we do not pay dividends on any outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for six or more quarterly dividend periods (whether or not declared or consecutive), holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other outstanding series of preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors to serve until all unpaid dividends have been fully paid or declared and set apart for payment. In addition, certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock cannot be made without the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. In any matter in which the Series A Preferred Stock may vote, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote. The 8.375 Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and the Series B Depositary Shares. We have designated 3,600 shares of our Preferred Stock as Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock underlying the Series B Depositary Shares will rank, as to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up:

Dividends . We will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, when and as declared by our board of directors, at the rate of 8.375 of the 25,000.00 liquidation preference 25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to 2,093.75 per share or 2.09375 per depositary share per year).

Liquidation Preference . The liquidation preference of each share of Series B Preferred Stock is 25,000.00 25.00 per depositary share).

Special Optional Redemption Upon a Change of Control or Delisting Event . Upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 90 days after the first date on which such Delisting Event occurred, for cash, at a redemption price of 25,000.00 per share (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the date of redemption, and the depositary will redeem a proportional number of Series B Depositary Shares representing the shares redeemed. With respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, a Delisting Event occurs when, after the original issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, both (i) the shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or the Series B Depositary Shares) are no longer listed on Nasdaq, the NYSE or the NYSE AMER, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to Nasdaq, the NYSE or the NYSE AMER, and (ii) we are not subject to the Exchange Act, but any Series B Preferred Stock is still outstanding. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), we may, at our option, redeem the Series B Preferred Stock underlying the Series B Depositary Shares, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash, at a redemption price of 25,000.00 per share (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the date of redemption, and the depositary will redeem a proportional number of Series B Depositary Shares representing the shares redeemed. With respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, a Change of Control occurs when, after the original issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing: 
 the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of shares of our company entitling that person to exercise more than 50 of the total voting power of all shares of our company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and following the closing of any transaction referred to in the bullet point above, neither we nor any acquiring or surviving entity (or if, in connection with such transaction shares of our Common Stock are converted into or exchanged for (in whole or in part) common equity securities of another entity), has a class of common securities (or ADRs representing such securities) listed on Nasdaq, the NYSE or the NYSE AMER, or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to Nasdaq, the NYSE or the NYSE AMER. We refer to redemption following a Delisting Event or Change of Control as a special optional redemption . If, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or the Change of Control Conversion Date (each as defined below), as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of exercise of any of our redemption rights relating to the Series B Preferred Stock (whether our optional redemption right or our special optional redemption right), the holders of Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below. 

 Conversion . Upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event or a Change of Control, as applicable, each holder of Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock) to direct the depositary, on such holder s behalf, to convert some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock underlying the Series B Depositary Shares held by such holder on the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable into a number of shares of our Common Stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration) per depositary share equal to the lesser of: the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the sum of the 25.00 per depositary share liquidation preference plus the amount of any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable (unless the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable is after a record date for a Series B Preferred Stock dividend payment and prior to the corresponding Series B Preferred Stock dividend payment date, in which case no additional amount for such accumulated and unpaid dividend will be included in this sum) by (2) the Common Stock Price (as defined herein); and 1.25313 (i.e., the Share Cap), subject to certain adjustments; and subject, in each case, to certain conditions, including, under specified circumstances, an aggregate cap on the total number of shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion and to provisions for the receipt of alternative consideration. 
 If, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide a redemption notice, whether pursuant to our special optional redemption right or our optional redemption right, holders of Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock will not have any right to direct the depositary to convert the Series B Preferred Stock, and any Series B Preferred Stock subsequently selected for redemption that has been tendered for conversion will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control Conversion Date, as applicable. Because each depositary share represents a 1/1000th interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock ultimately received for each depositary share will be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock divided by 1000. In the event that the conversion would result in the issuance of fractional shares of Common Stock, we will pay the holder of Series B Depositary Shares cash in lieu of such fractional shares. Except as provided above in connection with a Delisting Event or Change of Control, shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property. For purposes of this description of the Series B Preferred Stock and the underlying Series B Depositary Shares, Change of Control Conversion Date means a business day fixed by our board of directors that is not fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of the Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock. For purposes of this description of the Series B Preferred Stock and the underlying Series B Depositary Shares, Common Stock Price for any Change of Control will be: (1) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of our Common Stock is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock; and (2) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of our Common Stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing prices for our Common Stock on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our Common Stock is then traded (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which our Common Stock is then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for our Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if our Common Stock is not then 

 listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange. The Common Stock Price for any Delisting Event will be the average of the closing price per share of our Common Stock on the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of the Delisting Event. For purposes of this description of the Series B Preferred Stock and the underlying Series B Depositary Shares, Delisting Event Conversion Date means a business day fixed by our board of directors that is not fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which we provide the notice described above to the holders of the Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock. Voting Rights. Holders of the Series B Depositary Shares representing interests in the Series B Preferred Stock generally will have no voting rights. However, if we do not pay dividends on any outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for six or more quarterly dividend periods (whether or not declared or consecutive), holders of Series B Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other outstanding series of preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our Board of Directors to serve until all unpaid dividends have been fully paid or declared and set apart for payment. In addition, certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock cannot be made without the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. In any matter in which the Series B Preferred Stock may vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote. As a result, each depositary share will be entitled to 1/1000th of a vote. The Series X Preferred Stock. We have designated 5,003 shares of our Preferred Stock as Series X Preferred Stock. The Series X Preferred Stock ranks: 
 senior to any class or series of our capital stock created specifically ranking by its terms junior to the Series X Preferred Stock; on parity to our Common Stock; on parity to any class or series of our capital stock created specifically ranking by its terms on parity with the Series X Preferred Stock; and junior to any class or series of our capital stock created specifically ranking by its terms senior to the Series X Preferred Stock; in each case, as to distributions of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Dividends . Holders of Series X Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on shares of Series X Preferred Stock equal (on an as-converted basis) to and in the same form as dividends actually paid on our Common Stock or other junior securities. Liquidation Preference . In the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our Series X Preferred Stock will participate pari passu (on an as-converted basis, without regard to any blocker provisions) with any distribution of proceeds to holders of our Common Stock. Redemption . We are not obligated to redeem or repurchase any shares of Series X Preferred Stock. Shares of Series X Preferred Stock are not otherwise entitled to any redemption rights or mandatory sinking fund or analogous fund provisions. Conversion . The Series X Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders thereof at any time after issuance into the number of registered shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the aggregate stated value of the Series X Preferred Stock being converted by the conversion price then in effect. The initial conversion price is 4.03 and is subject to adjustment as described below. No holder may request a conversion of its Series X Preferred Stock to the extent such conversion would result in the holder and its affiliates beneficially owning more than a pre- 

 set conversion blocker threshold, which will initially be set at 19.99 of our Common Stock then outstanding (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation ). The amount of beneficial ownership of a holder and its affiliates will be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of that section. Conversion Price Adjustment-Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If we pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution payable in Common Stock on our Common Stock or any Common Stock equivalents, subdivide or combine our outstanding Common Stock, or reclassify our Common Stock in such a way that we issue additional shares of our capital stock, the conversion price will be adjusted by multiplying the then-existing conversion price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the distribution, dividend, adjustment or recapitalization and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such action. Fundamental Transaction. If we effect a fundamental transaction (as defined below), then upon any future conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock, the holders will have the right to receive, for each share of Common Stock they would have received upon such conversion, the same kind and amount of securities, cash or property as such holder would have been entitled to receive in the fundamental transaction had it been the holder of Common Stock immediately prior to the fundamental transaction. The term fundamental transaction means any of the following: 
 a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity or any stock sale to, or other business combination in which the Company is not the surviving entity; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions; any completed tender offer or exchange offer involving holders of Common Stock in which more than 50 of the Common Stock is converted or exchanged into other securities, cash or property, regardless of who makes such offer; or any reclassification of Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange by which our Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (but not a reverse stock split). If the holders of Common Stock are given a choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a fundamental transaction, the holders of Series X Preferred Stock will be given the same choice on conversion of such holders shares. Voting Rights. The Series X Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except to the extent expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation or as otherwise required by law. However, so long as 2,502 shares of Series X Preferred Stock are outstanding, we may not take any of the following actions without the affirmative consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Series X Preferred Stock: 
 amend our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other charter documents so as to materially, specifically and adversely affect the preferences, rights, or privileges of the Series X Preferred Stock; issue additional shares of Series X Preferred Stock or increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of Series X Preferred Stock; sell, assign, monetize, pledge or otherwise divest or encumber our rights under any material license agreement, joint venture or other partnership agreement to which we are a party as of the date of this offering and involving any drug or drug candidate; issue or commit to issue any other equity securities, with certain exceptions; issue any equity-based award or compensation to certain of our officers, unless the award has been unanimously approved by our compensation committee at a time when a designee appointed by the Series X Preferred holders is then serving on that committee; or 

 enter into any agreement or understanding to take any of the actions listed above. Anti-takeover Effects of Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware Law Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws Provisions. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the board of directors may determine. In addition, our By-laws require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders, including nominating directors for election at those meetings. Our By-laws also provide that our board of directors is able to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or due to the resignation or departure of an existing board member. Provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws could make the acquisition of our company through a tender offer, a proxy contest or other means more difficult and could make the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult. We expect these provisions to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits provided by our ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals. We believe the negotiation of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal could result in an improvement of its terms. Delaware Law. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless: 
 prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and (b) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or is an affiliate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of a corporation s outstanding voting securities. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide benefits to Company employees who are not Eligible Employees Non-Eligible Employees chosen by the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, and the provision of any such benefits to a Non-Eligible Employee shall in no way obligate the Company to provide such benefits to any other employee, even if similarly situated. If benefits under the Plan are provided to a Non-Eligible Employee, references in the Plan to Eligible Employee (and similar references) shall be deemed to refer to such Non-Eligible Employee. 
 (c) Certain Reductions. In addition to Section 2(e) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the authority to reduce an Eligible Employee s severance benefits, in whole or in part, by any other severance benefits, pay and benefits provided during a period following written notice of a business closing or mass layoff, pay and benefits in lieu of such notice, or other similar benefits payable to the Eligible Employee by the Company or an Affiliate that become payable in connection with the Eligible Employee s termination of employment pursuant to (i) any applicable legal requirement, including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other similar state law or (ii) any Company policy or practice providing for the Eligible Employee to remain on the payroll for a limited period of time after being given notice of the termination of the Eligible Employee s employment, and the Plan Administrator shall so construe and implement the terms of the Plan.

The Company s decision to apply such reductions to the severance benefits of one Eligible Employee and the amount of such reductions shall in no way obligate the Company to apply the same reductions in the same amounts to the severance benefits of any other Eligible Employee. In the Company s sole discretion, such reductions may be applied on a retroactive basis, with severance benefits previously paid being re-characterized as payments pursuant to the Company s statutory obligation.

The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever amount (i.e., the amount determined by clause (x) or by clause (y)), after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the Eligible Employee s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the Reduction Method that results in the greatest economic benefit for the Eligible Employee. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the Pro Rata Reduction Method ). 
 
 Notwithstanding any provisions in this Section above to the contrary, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the Payment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A as follows: (A) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for the Eligible Employee as determined on an after-tax basis; (B) as a second priority, Payments that are contingent on future events e.g. , being terminated without Cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent on future events; and (C) as a third priority, Payments that are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A. The Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting or law firm to make the determinations required by this Section. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting or law firm required to be made hereunder. If the Eligible Employee receives a Payment for which the Reduced Amount was determined pursuant to clause (x) above and the Internal Revenue Service determines thereafter that some portion of the Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, Eligible Employee agrees to promptly return to the Company a sufficient amount of the Payment (after reduction pursuant to clause (x) above) so that no portion of the remaining Payment is subject to the Excise Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Reduced Amount was determined pursuant to clause (y) above, the Eligible Employee shall have no obligation to return any portion of the Payment pursuant to the preceding sentence.

If the Company determines that any severance payments or benefits provided under the Plan constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A, then except to the extent that severance payments may be delayed until the Delayed Initial Payment Date pursuant to the preceding paragraph, on the first regular payroll date following the effective date of an Eligible Employee s Release, the Company shall (1) pay the Eligible Employee a lump sum amount equal to the sum of the severance benefit payments that the Eligible Employee would otherwise have received through such payroll date but for the delay in payment related to the effectiveness of the Release and (2) commence paying the balance, if any, of the severance benefits in accordance with the applicable payment schedule.

The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Eligible Employees and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. 
 (c) Enforce Your Rights. If your claim for a Plan benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan, if applicable, and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to 110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. If you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. (d) Assistance with Your Questions. If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

All claims, disputes, or causes of action under this section, whether by Employee or the Company, must be brought solely in an individual capacity, and will not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The Arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences in this paragraph are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class will proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. Any arbitration proceeding under this Arbitration section will be presided over by a single arbitrator and conducted by JAMS, Inc.

The Company 
 
 -5- 

will pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of Employee if the dispute were decided in a court of law. This section will not apply to any action or claim that cannot be subject to mandatory arbitration as a matter of law, including, without limitation, claims brought pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, as amended, and the California Labor Code, as amended, to the extent such claims are not permitted by applicable law to be submitted to mandatory arbitration and such applicable law is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise invalid (collectively, the Excluded Claims ). In the event Employee brings multiple claims, including one of the Excluded Claims listed above, the Excluded Claims may be filed with a court, while any other claims will remain subject to mandatory arbitration. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent either Employee or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any final award in any arbitration proceeding hereunder may be entered as a judgment in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction and enforced accordingly. 19. Indemnification . Employee shall execute the Company s standard form of indemnification agreement provided herewith.
 20. Complete Agreement . This Agreement, together with Employee s Confidentiality Agreement and the other agreements referenced herein, forms the complete and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement between the Parties with regard to this subject matter, and supersedes and replaces any other agreements or promises made to Employee by anyone, whether oral or written.

To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that may arise between Employee and the Company, both Employee and the Company mutually agree that pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Employee will submit solely to final, binding and confidential arbitration any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising from or relating to: the negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance, breach or enforcement of this Agreement; or Employee s employment with the Company (including but not limited to all statutory claims); or the termination of Employee s employment with the Company (including but not limited to all statutory claims). BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROCEDURE, BOTH EMPLOYEE AND THE COMPANY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE OR THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING. The Arbitrator will have the sole and exclusive authority to determine whether a dispute, claim or cause of action is subject to arbitration under this section and to determine any procedural questions which grow out of such disputes, claims or causes of action and bear on their final disposition. All claims, disputes, or causes of action under this section, whether by Employee or the Company, must be brought solely in an individual capacity, and will not be brought as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated with the claims of any other person or entity. The Arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences in this paragraph are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s) alleged or brought on behalf of a class will proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. Any arbitration proceeding under this Arbitration section will be presided over by a single arbitrator and conducted by JAMS, Inc. JAMS in San Francisco, CA under the then applicable JAMS rules for the resolution of employment disputes (available upon request and also currently available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/). Employee and the Company both have the right to be represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding, at each party s own expense. The Arbitrator will: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute; (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award; and (c) be authorized to award any or all remedies that Employee or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law. The Company will pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the amount of court fees that would be required of Employee if the dispute were decided in a court of law. This section will not apply to any action or claim that cannot be subject to mandatory arbitration as a matter of law, including, without limitation, claims brought pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, as amended, and the California Labor Code, as amended, to the extent such claims are not permitted by applicable law to be submitted to mandatory arbitration and such applicable law is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise invalid (collectively, the Excluded Claims ). In the event Employee brings multiple claims, including one of the Excluded Claims listed above, the Excluded Claims may be filed with a court, while any other claims will remain subject to mandatory arbitration. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent either Employee or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any final award in any arbitration proceeding hereunder may be entered as a judgment in the federal and state courts of any competent jurisdiction and enforced accordingly.

Schedule 10.8 Joint Press Release Organon and ObsEva Enter Global License Agreement to Develop and Commercialize Ebopiprant (OBE022), an Investigational Agent Being Evaluated as a First-in-Class Treatment for Preterm Labor Every year, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 completed weeks of gestation)i ; agent is being studied in an area of significant unmet need Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR of the SIX Swiss Exchange Jersey City, N.J., Geneva, Switzerland, July 27, 2021 - Organon (NYSE: OGN), a global women s health company and ObsEva (NASDAQ: OBSV) (SIX: OBSN), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving women s reproductive health, today announced that the companies have entered into an agreement whereby Organon will license the global development, manufacturing and commercial rights to ebopiprant (OBE022). Ebopiprant is an investigational, orally active, selective prostaglandin F2 (PGF2 receptor antagonist being evaluated as a potential treatment for preterm labor by reducing inflammation and uterine contractions. If approved, it has potential to be a first-in-class innovation for this common and serious condition with no approved therapies for acute treatment of preterm labor in the United States. This development-stage asset is being studied in one of the most crucial unmet needs for women globally. As we build Organon s women s health research and development portfolio, the agreement strengthens our path to long term growth, said Kevin Ali, Organon s Chief Executive Officer. Organon and ObsEva share a commitment to improve the lives of women around the world. Through Organon s strong development, scientific and medical capabilities, our goal is to change the future for millions of mothers and babies. Organon intends to work with the scientific and medical communities and regulatory authorities in major markets, including the United States, to advance the clinical development and registration of ebopiprant. Brian O Callaghan, CEO of ObsEva, commented, Organon is the ideal partner for the development and commercialization of ebopiprant and we see this agreement as an important step in advancing this investigational agent. Although preterm birth rates are on the rise, there are currently no other known compounds in development. That is why we are focused on evaluating this agent in an important area of unmet need. Together with the data generated to date, this agreement underscores the value of our program, and we look forward to executing on our shared vision. Under the terms of the agreement, Organon will gain exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize ebopiprant. ObsEva is entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties on commercial sales as well as up to 500 million in upfront and milestone payments including 25 million to be paid at signing, up to 90 million in development and regulatory milestones and up to 385 million sales based milestones. Goldman Sachs acted as exclusive financial advisor to ObsEva. About Ebopiprant In November 2020, ObsEva announced positive results from PROLONG, the Phase 2a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ebopiprant in preterm labor. In this study, 113 women with spontaneous preterm labor (gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks) were randomized and treated with atosiban (ex-U.S. standard of care) plus ebopiprant or atosiban plus placebo for 7 days. There were 83

(73 women with singleton pregnancies and 30 (27 with twin pregnancies. One hundred and forty-one neonates were born. In the PROLONG study, ebopiprant reduced delivery in singleton pregnancies at 48 hours after the start of dosing by 55 compared to atosiban alone. Overall, 7/56 (12.5 of women receiving ebopiprant delivered within 48 hours of starting treatment compared to 12/55 (21.8 receiving placebo (OR 90 CI: 0.52 (0.22, 1.23)). In singleton pregnancies, 5/40 (12.5 of women receiving ebopiprant delivered within 48 hours compared to 11/41 (26.8 receiving placebo (OR 90 CI: 0.39 (0.15, 1.04)).
