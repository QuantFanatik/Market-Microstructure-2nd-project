DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Overview 

Inky Inc. was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on June 12, 2018. The Company we, us, or the Company is engaged in developing tattoo
projects. Inky is developing a service with an artificial intelligence that will create a unique tattoo design and online platform to
connect and inspire tattoo artists and clients with the objective of simplifying and enhancing the experience for clients when choosing
a tattoo design and finding an appropriate artist. 

 In November 2022, the Company has
launched an online platform with a global reach, providing an effortless experience for individuals interested in the art of
tattoos. The platform facilitates the process of finding an ideal tattoo design and suitable artist for clients, while also aiding
tattoo artists in locating potential clients. The overall aim of the platform is to streamline and expedite the process of finding a
tattoo artist and design, creating an enjoyable experience for both parties involved. We have made the search process much simpler
and more convenient by means of our website https://inky.live. 

 As of November 2022, the company has launched
an online platform that targets an international audience. The platform was developed to streamline this process by creating an interactive
service that connects clients with tattoo artists, focusing on facilitating a seamless experience for both parties, thereby bringing a
positive change to the industry. The platform has an extensive database of tattoo artists, providing them with an additional advertising
space to showcase their work and attract potential clients. 

 Inky Inc. has introduced a subscription-based service
that provides users with access to AI-generated tattoo ideas. As of November 30, 2022, we managed to generate the first income based on
selling access to the application programming interface (API), which has become the primary source of revenue for the Company. This feature
allows customers to obtain personalized tattoo designs, saving them time and effort in selecting a design. The company has observed a
positive trend in project development and an increase in income generation. The AI-powered service also benefits tattoo artists, who can
use it to explore new styles and enhance their skills. By analyzing customer preferences and generating unique designs, Inky Inc.'s AI-powered
service provides tattoo artists with a valuable tool for expanding their creative horizons. 

As of November 30, 2022 Inky Inc. has put in funds
in the development of products by purchasing software with artificial intelligence for tattoo idea generation service for 100,000 and
its implementation: tattoo idea generation service integration and improvement of website sections. Based on this the Company launched
an additional service on the website, which was formed into a service for selling API access by subscription. The total asset during the
year has increased by 106,395 from 19,456 as on November 2021 to 125,851 as on November 30, 2022.

We were previously considered a shell company as defined by Rule 405 of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, during the year ended November 30, 2022, we ceased to be a shell company as we have significantly
increased our business activities and assets and have met the criteria set forth in Rule 144(i)(1) under the Securities Act. As a result,
we are now considered a non-shell company. We have updated our filings with the SEC to reflect this change in status. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We plan that the main source
of income for INKY will be monetization from the sale of API for generating tattoo ideas. We are interested in increasing website traffic
by increasing the number of users which will lead also to great popularity and high demand. Moreover, we plan to attract additional promotional
tools that we believe will actively help us develop and bring additional income. 

Competition 

Developing and distributing
API (Application Programming Interface) is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent use. API simplifies the programming
process when building applications by abstracting away the underlying implementation and providing only the objects or actions that the
developer needs. If a GUI for an email client can provide the user with a button that will go through all the steps to fetch and highlight
new emails, then the File I/O API can give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring
the developer to understand file operations, systems happening behind the scenes. 

With respect to competing
for consumers of our app, we will compete primarily based on API quality and customer reviews. We will compete for promotional and digital
storefront placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the storefront owner, historical performance, perception
of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands, properties, and other content. We believe that our small size will provide
us a competitive advantage for the time being and allow us to make quick product development to take advantage of consumer preferences
at a particular point in time. 

Most of our competitors and
our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, including: 

 significantly greater
financial and personnel resources; 

 stronger brand and
consumer recognition; 

 the capacity to
leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products; 

 more substantial
intellectual property of their own; 

 lower labor and
development costs and better overall economies of scale; and 

 broader distribution
and presence. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to various
federal, state, and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security
of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising
and marketing activities, and sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which
could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information
and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, may significantly increase
our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations,
our compliance requirements and costs will increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. 

Employees 

We are a start-up company
and currently have one employee - Ioanna Kallidou, our president, treasurer, secretary, and director. We intend to outsource any additional
services if the business requires.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 INKY Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of INKY Inc. (the Company) as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November
30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Consideration of the Company s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses and has minimal operations
which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 9A. Controls and
Procedures 

The Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An assessment was conducted
with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms. 

Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022, using the
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO - 2013 ). 

A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2022, the Company determined
that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated
to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost
important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of
the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight
over management s activities. 

2. We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of November 30,
2022, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for cash, including failure to segregate cash
handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signatures on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects
of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in its bank accounts. 

3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls 
As at November 30, 2022, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure
or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due
to unmitigated factors. 

4. The Company
 lacks segregation of duties . 

Accordingly, the Company
concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material
weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of November 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended November 30, 2022, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director 

Set forth below is a brief
description of the background and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five years. 

IOANNA KALLIDOU 

Ioanna Kallidou has acted
as our President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Secretary, and sole member of
our board of directors since our incorporation on June 12, 2018. She is a graduate of the University of Nicosia with bachelor s
degree of Business Administration: Management and distance Learned of Management Information Systems courses under the University of Nicosia.
Since April 2016 to the incorporation date (April 2016-June 2018), Ms. Kallidou has been a junior software engineer at Crowares Inc. 

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Our board of directors is
currently composed of one member, and she does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements
of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list on the NASDAQ Global Market). The NASDAQ independence definition includes
a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that
neither the director, nor any of her family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. 

In addition, our board of
directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of
directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective
determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have
reviewed and discussed information provided by directors and us regarding to our director's business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to our management and us. 

INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

No director, executive officer, significant employee,
or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years.
