EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, of Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Prologis, Inc. or the Parent mean Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and references to Prologis, L.P. or the Operating Partnership or the OP mean Prologis, L.P., and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the Company, Prologis, we, our or us means the Parent and the OP collectively. 
 
 The Parent is a real estate investment trust (a REIT and the general partner of the OP. At December 31, 2022, the Parent owned a 97.60 common general partnership interest in the OP and substantially all of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining 2.40 common limited partnership interests are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. 
 
 We operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As sole general partner, the Parent has control of the OP through complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and therefore, consolidates the OP for financial reporting purposes. Because the only significant asset of the Parent is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements. 
 
 We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Parent and the OP into this single report results in the following benefits: 

enhances investors understanding of the Parent and the OP by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business 

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the Company s disclosure applies to both the Parent and the OP and 

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

It is important to understand the few differences between the Parent and the OP in the context of how we operate the Company. The Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the OP and issuing public equity from time to time. The OP holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly. The OP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent, which are contributed to the OP in exchange for partnership units, the OP generates capital required by the business through the OP s operations, incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of partnership units to third parties. 
 
 The presentation of noncontrolling interests, stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent and those of the OP. The differences in the presentations between stockholders equity and partners capital result from the differences in the equity and capital issuances in the Parent and in the OP. 
 
 The preferred stock, common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and distributions in excess of net earnings of the Parent are presented as stockholders equity in the Parent s consolidated financial statements. These items represent the common and preferred general partnership interests held by the Parent in the OP and are presented as general partner s capital within partners capital in the OP s consolidated financial statements. The common limited partnership interests held by the limited partners in the OP are presented as noncontrolling interest within equity in the Parent s consolidated financial statements and as limited partners capital within partners capital in the OP s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 To highlight the differences between the Parent and the OP, separate sections in this report, as applicable, individually discuss the Parent and the OP, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Parent and the OP, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of Prologis.

The statements in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate as well as management s beliefs and assumptions. Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial results. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, and estimates including variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, acquisition and development activity, contribution and disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate, our debt, capital structure and financial position, our ability to earn revenues from co-investment ventures, form new co-investment ventures and the availability of capital in existing or new co-investment ventures are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to: (i) international, national, regional and local economic and political climates and conditions (ii) changes in global financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates (iii) increased or unanticipated competition for our properties (iv) risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of properties, including the integration of the operations of significant real estate portfolios (v) maintenance of Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status, tax structuring and changes in income tax laws and rates (vi) availability of financing and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings (vii) risks related to our investments in our co-investment ventures, including our ability to establish new co-investment ventures (viii) risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks (ix) environmental uncertainties, including risks of natural disasters (x) risks related to global pandemics and (xi) those additional factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this report except as may be required by law. 
 
 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. Business 
 
 Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We have a significant ownership interest in the co-investment ventures, which are either consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. 
 
 Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Internal Revenue Code or IRC ). We believe the current organization and method of operation enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997. 
 
 We operate, manage and measure the operating performance of our properties on an owned and managed O&M basis. Our O&M portfolio includes our consolidated properties as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We make operating decisions based on our total O&M portfolio as we manage the properties without regard to their ownership. We also evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the O&M portfolio our share to reflect our share of the financial results of the O&M portfolio. 
 
 Included in our discussion below are references to funds from operations FFO and net operating income NOI ), neither of which are United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Net Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders in the Consolidated Statements of Income to our FFO measures and a reconciliation of NOI to Operating Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 
 Our corporate headquarters is located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Denver, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. 
 
 Our Internet address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website.

 THE COMPANY 
 
 Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries across four continents. Our portfolio focuses on the world s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale across these locations allows us to better serve our customers diverse logistics requirements. Our teams actively manage our portfolio and provide comprehensive real estate services, including leasing, property management, development, acquisitions and dispositions. We invest significant capital into new logistics properties principally through our 
 3 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 development activity and third-party acquisitions. The contribution of newly developed properties to our co-investment ventures and the sale of non-strategic properties to third parties allow s us to recycle capital into our development and acquisition activities. 
 
 While the majority of our properties in the U.S. are wholly owned, we hold a significant ownership interest in properties internationally and in the U.S. through our investments in the co-investment ventures. Partnering with the world s largest institutional investors through co-investment ventures allows us to enhance and diversify our real estate returns as well as mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
 
 Logistics supply chains have increased dramatically in importance to our customers and the global economy. The long-term trends of e-commerce adoption and supply chain resiliency continue to drive the need for increased warehouse space to store and distribute goods. This demand has translated into meaningful increases in rents and low vacancy. We believe this demand is driven by three primary factors: (i) customer supply chains re-positioning to address the significant shift to e-commerce and heightened service expectations (ii) overall consumption and household growth and (iii) our customers desire for more supply chain resiliency. We believe these forces will keep demand strong for the long-term. 
 
 The nature of the services we are providing to our customers is expanding. The scale of our 1.2 billion square foot portfolio allows us to provide a platform of solutions to address challenges that companies face in global fulfillment today. Through Prologis Essentials, we focus on innovative ways to meet our customers operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce needs. Our customer experience teams, proprietary technology and strategic partnerships are foundational to Prologis Essentials and allow us to provide our customers with unique and actionable insights to drive greater efficiency in their operations. 
 
 Our long-standing dedication to Environmental, Social and Governance ESG practices strengthens our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG are an important aspect of our business strategy that we believe delivers a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. 
 
 2022 Significant Acquisition 
 
 On October 3, 2022, we acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively Duke through a merger transaction that we refer to as the Duke Transaction and is detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Our financial condition and operating results include the Duke properties subsequent to the acquisition date. The Duke portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144 million square feet and was highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. There was approximately 15 million square feet of non-strategic industrial operating properties that we do not intend to hold long-term and are classified as other real estate investments. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and investments in other ventures. The acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, South Florida and Southern California. The total acquisition price, including transaction costs, was 23.2 billion and was funded through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis, Inc. common stock issued using the closing price on September 30, 2022 and the assumption of debt. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy and our ability to scale, we integrated the Duke portfolio while adding minimal property management and general and administrative expenses G&A ).

Overview 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly-owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 1.2 billion square feet across the following geographies: 
 
 Throughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments. 
 
 OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 
 Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. 
 
 Below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions): 

(1) 
 
 NOI from the Real Estate Segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses. NOI from the Strategic Capital Segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses. 

(2) 
 
 A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year, is contributed to a co-investment venture following completion or is 90 occupied. Amounts represent our total expected investment TEI upon stabilization, which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs.

Real Estate Segment 
 
 Rental Operations. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85 to 90 of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. For leases that commenced during 2022 within the consolidated operating portfolio, the weighted average lease term was 69 months. We expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth, outside of the Duke Transaction, will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents when leases expire, as discussed further below. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. Substantially all of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows from rental operations are generated in the U.S. 
 
 Development. Given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides the opportunity to build to the requirements of our current and future customers while deepening our market presence. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our global land bank and redevelopment sites (ii) the development expertise of our local teams (iii) the depth of our customer relationships (iv) our ability to integrate sustainable design features that result in cost-savings and operational efficiencies for our customers and (v) our procurement capabilities that allow us to secure high-demand construction materials at lower cost. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the value of our Real Estate Segment. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
 
 Strategic Capital Segment 
 
 Our Strategic Capital Segment allows us to partner with many of the world s largest institutional investors. The business is capitalized principally through private and public equity of which 95 is either in perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures, and two publicly traded vehicles (Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico). We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our eight unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15 to 50 ). This structure allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S. 
 
 This segment produces durable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10 to 15 of our recurring consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO, all while requiring minimal capital other than our investment in the venture. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset management and property management services. Asset management fees are primarily driven by the quarterly valuation of the real estate properties owned by the respective ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction management, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees promotes or promote revenues periodically during the life of a venture, upon liquidation of a venture or upon stabilization of individual venture assets based primarily on the total return of the investments over certain financial hurdles . We plan to grow this business and increase revenues by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. The majority of strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. 
 
 FUTURE GROWTH 
 
 We believe that the quality and scale of our portfolio, our ability to build out our land bank, our strategic capital business, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet are differentiators that allow us to drive growth in revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows. 

Rent Growth. We expect rents in our markets to continue to increase due to healthy demand combined with low vacancy. Due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential to drive future organic NOI growth. We estimate that our lease mark-to-market is approximately 67 (on a net effective basis), which represents the growth rate from in-place rents to current market rents based on our share of the O&M portfolio at December 31, 2022. Therefore, even if there was no additional market rent growth in the future, we expect our lease renewals to translate into significant increases in future income. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent NER of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) in every quarter since 2013.

Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program requires sourcing well-located land and redevelopment sites through acquisition opportunities, including our innovative approach with Covered Land Plays, which are income producing assets acquired with the intention to redevelop for higher and better use as industrial properties. Our investment in the development portfolio was 4.2 billion at December 31, 2022. We believe that the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land, including options and Covered Land Plays, has the potential to support the development of 34.2 billion 39.0 billion on an O&M basis) of TEI of new logistics space. The global nature of our development program provides a wide landscape of opportunities to pursue based on our judgement of market conditions, opportunities and risks. 

We expect to create value as we build new properties. We measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the stabilized value above our TEI. As properties are completed and leased, we expect to realize the value creation principally through gains realized through contributions of these properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of the consolidated portfolio. 

Strategic Capital Advantages. We raise capital to support the long-term growth of the co-investment ventures while maintaining our own substantial investments in these vehicles. At December 31, 2022, the gross book value of the operating portfolio held by our eight unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 49.3 billion across 488 million square feet.

 G&A Expenses is a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted G&A expenses is calculated from our Consolidated Financial Statements as G&A Expenses and Strategic Capital Expenses , less expenses under the Prologis Promote Plan PPP and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by the ventures . 

Balance Sheet Strength. The Duke Transaction increased the strength and size of our balance sheet while allowing us to maintain our low leverage. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining maturity of our consolidated debt was 9 years and the weighted average interest rate was 2.5 , primarily as a result of our refinancing activities over the last several years. Through our refinancing activities we have substantially addressed all our debt maturities until 2026 and have taken advantage of previously low interest rates. At December 31, 2022, we had total available liquidity of 4.1 billion. We continue to maintain low leverage as a percentage of our real estate investments and our market capitalization. As a result of our low leverage, available liquidity and investment capacity in the co-investment ventures, we have significant capacity to capitalize on opportunistic value-added investments as they arise. 

Economies of Scale from Growth. We have scalable systems and infrastructure in place to grow both our consolidated and O&M portfolios with limited incremental G&A expense. We use adjusted G&A expenses as a percentage of the O&M portfolio (based on gross book value) to measure and evaluate our overhead costs. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive development and acquisition activity while further reducing G&A as a percentage of our investments in real estate. The acquisition of the Duke portfolio in 2022 is a key example of this, where we increased our O&M portfolio by over 20 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and had minimal increases to G&A expenses , resulting in lower G&A expenses as a percentage of investments in real estate. While we plan to make future investments in our new lines of business through Prologis Essentials, we expect to maintain our operational efficiency.

Staying Ahead of What s Next . We are focused on creating value beyond real estate by enhancing our customers experience, leveraging our scale to obtain procurement savings and innovating through data analytics and digitization efforts. This includes investments in early and growth-stage companies that are focused on emerging technology. Through Prologis Essentials we support our customers through service and product offerings, including innovative solutions to operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce that can make our customers decision process easier and their enterprise more efficient. 

Competition 
 
 Real estate ownership is highly fragmented, and we face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including regional, national and global operators and developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business. 
 
 Despite the competition, our global reach and local market knowledge over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages, including the following: 

a portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities, growing consumption and high barriers to entry, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure, including our Last Touch facilities 

the ability to leverage the organizational scale and structure of our 1.2 billion square foot O&M portfolio to provide a single point of contact for our multi-market customers to address their needs through our in-house global Customer Led Solutions Team 

services and solutions offered through Prologis Essentials to assist our customers with their operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce needs 

a strategically located, global land bank and redevelopment sites that have the potential to support the development of 39.0 billion of TEI of new logistics space on an O&M basis 

local teams with the expertise, experience and relationships to lease our properties and deploy capital advantageously 

development of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that meet customer needs for high-quality buildings while enabling them to make progress on their own sustainability objectives 

relationships and successful track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business that is comprised of 95 perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures and two publicly traded vehicles 

a market intelligence team that allows us to track business conditions in real time, proactively pursue market opportunities and disruptions alike, and develop revenue-generating capabilities to strengthen our operational excellence 

an investment in technology and talent to support our sustainability objectives, including expanding our efforts around renewable energy 

Prologis Ventures, our corporate venture capital group, and Prologis Labs, our initiative for testing new technologies alongside our customers, together track the leading edge of innovation and technologies within real estate and the supply chain, creating important capabilities that connect Prologis with the C-suites of our customers and 

a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity, borrowing capacity and long-term fixed debt with low rates. 

Customers 
 
 At December 31, 2022, in our Real Estate Segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 4,000 customers occupying 601 million square feet of logistics operating properties (6,600 customers occupying 1.2 billion square feet for our O&M portfolio). Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users who operate in various industries, providing diverse goods to consumers throughout the globe. 
 
 The location of our global portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right real estate solutions for their supply chains that, in turn, allows them to meet end-consumer delivery expectations. We have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day access (defined as Last Touch and next day access (defined as city distribution), to the consumer population. We have also invested in facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports.

In our Strategic Capital Segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2022, we had 162 investors in our private equity ventures, several of which invest in multiple ventures. 
 
 Our People 
 
 Our people are the foundation of our business. They implement our strategy and create value for our customers and shareholders. We actively seek to recruit and retain talented employees with varied experiences and viewpoints. The intent is to create an inclusive and diverse culture where each employee can do their best work and drive our collective success. 
 
 We are committed to our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging DEIB hiring practices. We also conduct annual pay equity analyses that cover women and people of color and aim to address differences in compensation not explained by relevant job factors accordingly. 
 
 The following charts display diversity by levels of seniority of our workforce at December 31, 2022:

 Managers include employees with manager, director or vice president titles. Senior leaders include employees with senior vice president or higher titles. 

We focus on learning and development at every level of the organization. We align employees goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the long-term success of the company. We then provide feedback on their performance towards those goals to ensure their growth. Providing our employees learning and development through training, educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate. In 2022, more than 2,000 employees completed more than 7,400 hours of company-provided or company-sponsored learning and development training. 
 
 We provide opportunities for our employees to share their perspectives and feedback on our company and their work experience. Our most recent employee engagement pulse survey, completed in November 2022 with a participation rate of 92 , indicated that 87 of Prologis employees are engaged based on their positive response to the questions that comprise our engagement driver index. 
 
 We strive to create a healthy and safe working environment for our employees. We provide workplace flexibility with accountability as determined by role. For example, for those employees who work on-site, we have protocols in place to help ensure a safe working environment. We continue to attract and retain talent in the industry through a robust benefit package, career growth opportunities, talent recognition and individual development planning.

 CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 
 
 We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the Board and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com . In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ESG 
 
 Environmental 
 
 We develop modern and efficient buildings with state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of our customers needs, advance structural, transportation and energy requirements, and make progress on our own sustainability goals and objectives. This includes new development and redevelopment of buildings to specifications that align with leading sustainable building standards and the implementation of energy solutions such as onsite solar generation , cool roofs, LED lighting, EV charging stations, waste diversion, recycling and xeriscaping. We regularly ask customers how Prologis can work with them to enhance the sustainability of their operations. We believe these services and solutions can deliver cost-savings and operational efficiencies, reduce energy and water consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions within our customers operations and across our own portfolio. 
 
 We have committed to: (i) installing 100 LED lighting within our logistics facilities across our O&M operating properties by 2025 (ii) installing 1 gigawatt of solar generation capacity, supported by storage, by 2025, and (iii) obtaining green building certifications for 100 of our eligible new development and redevelopment. We believe our Prologis Essentials LED and SolarSmart solutions create energy savings, help reduce the environmental footprint of our customers and accelerate our progress in these areas. At December 31, 2022, we had installed LED lighting across more than 70 of our logistics facilities within our O&M operating properties. During 2022, approximately 100 megawatts of solar generation capacity was installed on the roofs within our O&M portfolio. Both of these metrics exclude the operating properties acquired in the Duke Transaction and by Prologis European Logistics Fund PELF in September 2022.

To fund our sustainable development activities, we have utilized the proceeds from senior notes issuances to finance green projects eligible under our green bond framework. For development properties in our O&M portfolio that were approved by our Investment Committee after June 2021 and that reached stabilization during 2022, we certified 15 of our eligible developed and redeveloped buildings with green building certifications and the remaining 85 were scheduled for green building certification. 
 
 In 2022, we announced a new commitment to achieve net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2040, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our commitment is aligned with the Science Based Target initiative s Net Zero Standard and includes the following interim milestones: (i) 1 gigawatt of solar generation capacity, supported by storage, by 2025, as discussed above (ii) carbon neutral construction by 2025 and (iii) net zero operations for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. We believe we can improve our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions through energy efficiency, electrification and sourcing renewable energy for our offices. Scope 3 emissions comprise a significant portion of our total emissions. To decrease scope 3 emissions, we believe we can reduce building and tenant energy consumption, and expand our generation and use of renewable energy. In support of carbon neutral construction, we will pursue sustainable design, new construction practices and innovation in building materials, as well as purchase high-quality carbon offsets for emissions that cannot yet be eliminated. 
 
 Social 
 
 We are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions, and DEIB initiatives. We work in partnership with local leaders and 
 organizations to create jobs and job training programs promote health and safety and enhance recreational and transit infrastructure. We believe these efforts help create a more stable and predictable business environment for Prologis and our customers and support social wellness and well-being in the communities we serve. 
 
 For our customers, where recruitment and retention of logistics talent is a key challenge, we are helping build a talent pipeline through our Community Workforce Initiative CWI ), founded in 2018. The CWI is a talent development program that advances the skills and capabilities of logistics talent, with an emphasis on revitalizing career pathways and creating economic opportunities in the communities where we operate. In 2018, we set a goal to train 25,000 individuals by 2025 by partnering with leading public sector organizations and leveraging digital learning technologies to develop innovative training solutions. At December 31, 2022, under the program, we have trained approximately 21,000 individuals towards this goal. 
 
 Beginning in 2019, we committed to spending 75,000 hours supporting our local communities by 2025. To achieve this goal, we enable our employees to spend 40 working hours a year to volunteer, including at our company-sponsored day of volunteering, where employees around the globe volunteer on projects to help in their local communities. At December 31, 2022, we have contributed in excess of 38,000 hours towards our goal. In addition, we encourage our employees to support our local communities outside of working hours with our Dollars for Doers and other matching gifts programs, through which Prologis donates to eligible charities and non-profit organizations based on employees personal volunteer hours or dollar donations. 
 
 Governance 
 
 We strive to promote a culture of uncompromising integrity, including through our governance practices and corporate oversight. Our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions all serve to mitigate risk and preserve value for our company. Over the past eight years we have onboarded six new directors, increasing the ethnic, gender and geographical diversity of the Board, as well as its breadth of experience. The charters of our Board Governance and Nomination Committee and Talent and Compensation Committee provide that such committees have specific oversight over ESG matters and DEIB matters, respectively. The strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, dedication to proactive risk mitigation and engagement with our employees through ethics and anti-corruption training protects the financial, operational and reputational resilience of our company. Our global risk management team works with our Board to do regular enterprise-wide risk assessments to ensure proper oversight over real estate, financial and emerging risks across our global organization. We are committed to ensuring that 100 of our employees complete ethics training each year and continued to achieve this commitment in 2022. Along with this commitment, our employees completed more than 1,800 hours of information technology security, compliance and other ethics training. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded at December 31, 2022. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 We are exposed to various regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses, adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and 
 12 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 financial condition. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations. The impact of regional or country-specific economic instability, including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 INSURANCE COVERAGE 
 
 We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. Additionally, in 2021 we sponsored a catastrophe bond issuance that provides further insurance coverage through 2024 for potential losses resulting from earthquake risks in the U.S. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. These risks relate to Prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others, (i) risks related to our global operations (ii) risks related to our business (iii) risks related to financing and capital (iv) risks related to income taxes and (v) general risks. 
 
 Risks Related to our Global Operations 
 
 As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries. 
 
 We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During 2022, we generated approximately 1.0 billion or 17.3 of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors: 

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain geographies, including differing employment practices and labor issues 

local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our domestic standards and practices 

volatility in currencies and currency restrictions, which may prevent the availability of capital or the transfer of profits to the U.S. 

challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws 

unexpected changes in regulatory and environmental requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate 

the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing 

the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles, military conflicts and economic instability, including government shutdowns and withdrawals from the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements 

political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities 

foreign ownership restrictions in operations with the respective countries and 

access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations. 

In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors. 
 
 13 
 
 Table of Contents 

Compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 
 We are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and state and local fire, life-safety, energy and greenhouse gas emissions requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. 
 
 Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 To the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders. 
 
 The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 
 We hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2022, approximately 10.2 billion or 11.6 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 762.4 million or 17.2 of our total consolidated segment NOI was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on these amounts. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, specifically, our U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to these risks. 
 
 We attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries. Although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful. In addition, we occasionally use interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business. 
 
 Risks Related to our Business 
 
 General economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results. 
 
 We are exposed to the economic conditions and other events and occurrences in the local, regional, national and international geographies in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, 30.3 of our consolidated operating properties or 21.0 billion (based on consolidated gross book value, or investment before depreciation) were located in California (Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California markets), which represented 23.6 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 33.0 of our consolidated operating property NOI. Our revenues from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California s economic climate. Because of the investment we have located in California, a downturn in California s economy or real estate conditions, including state income tax and property tax laws, could adversely affect our business. 
 
 In addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain markets located in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Lehigh Valley, New Jersey/New York City, Seattle and South Florida. Of these markets, no single market contributed more than 10 of our total

 consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties , with the exception of New Jersey/New York City . Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business. 
 
 Our O&M portfolio, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in Japan and the U.K., and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets. 
 
 Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors. 
 
 Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. Significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage debt payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. As a REIT, under the IRC, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. We may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity. If we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales. 
 
 We may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our co-investment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities. Our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by: (i) competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties (ii) economic and market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and (iii) other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all. The co-investment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions and contributions could be delayed. 
 
 If we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations, sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting properties at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, and in particular, our distributable cash flow and debt covenants. 
 
 Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector. 
 
 Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified. 
 
 Investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include: 

local conditions, such as oversupply or a reduction in demand 

technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing or other technologies 

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers and competition from other available properties 

increasing costs of maintaining, insuring, renovating and making improvements to our properties 

our ability to reposition our properties due to changes in the business and logistics needs of our customers 

our ability to lease the properties at favorable rates and control variable operating costs and 

governmental and environmental regulations and the associated potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, usage, tax, tariffs and other laws. 

These factors may affect our ability to recover our investment in the properties and result in impairment charges.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire. 
 
 Our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. At December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 16.4 of our consolidated NER and 14.4 of our O&M NER. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and we may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow. 
 
 We are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire or we may lose potential customers. 
 
 We may acquire properties and companies that involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 
 We have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate, the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with entering a new market such as a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. The acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, including tax liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it. 
 
 We may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include: (i) the inability to dispose of non-industrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise (ii) potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions and (iii) performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management s attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies operations. 
 
 Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. 
 
 Our real estate development and redevelopment strategy is focused on monetizing land and redevelopment sites in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for long-term investment and for contribution or sale to a co-investment venture or third party, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may increase our investment in the development, renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the build-out and leasing of our current development portfolio. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks: 

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all 

we may explore development opportunities that may be abandoned and the related investment impaired 

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations 

we may incur higher construction costs, due primarily to this inflationary environment, or additional costs related to regulation that exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned due to defects or other issues 

we may not be able to attract third-party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product 

we may have properties that perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flows below budgeted amounts 

we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in impairment charges 

we may not be able to lease properties we develop on favorable terms or at all 

 16 
 
 Table of Contents 

we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our value-added properties on expected timetables or at all 

we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities and 

we may have substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, that require a significant amount of management s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations. 

We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming and attracting third-party investment in co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, and managing properties through co-investment ventures. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had investments in co-investment ventures, both public and private, that owned real estate with a gross book value of approximately 59.6 billion. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, or attract third-party investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments. The same factors that impact the valuation of our consolidated portfolio, as discussed above, also impact the portfolios held by the co-investment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues. 
 
 Our co-investment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face, including: 

our partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions made on behalf of the ventures 

our partners may seek to redeem their investment, and may do so simultaneously, causing the venture to seek capital to satisfy these requests on less than optimal terms 

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital 

our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the venture 

the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms 

our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to invest in or manage the assets underlying such relationships resulting in a decrease in our assets under management and a reduction in fee revenues. This may also require us to acquire the properties in order to maintain an investment in the portfolio and 

disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk. 

We generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however, we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely. We have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, such as NPR and FIBRA Prologis, for which we serve as sponsor or manager. These entities bear their own risks related to trading markets, foreign currency exchange rates and market demand. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. There is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated. 
 
 We have also made investments in early and growth-stage companies that are focused on emerging technology. These companies may not be successful at raising additional capital or generating cash flows to sustain operations, which could result in the impairment of our investment. In addition, through Prologis Essentials we are investing in the development of new business lines that are complementary to our core business. These business lines may not be successful and may include risks that are different than investing in our core real estate business. 
 
 We are exposed to various environmental risks, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. 
 
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or 
 17 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. 
 
 Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials. 
 
 In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. 
 
 Our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses. 
 
 We and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property. 
 
 Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business. 
 
 A number of our investments, both wholly-owned and owned through co-investment ventures, are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in California and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in Japan based on this analysis. See Item 2. Properties for more information on the markets above exposed to seismic activities. 
 
 Furthermore, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. 
 
 Risks Related to Financing and Capital 
 
 In order to meet REIT distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital. 
 
 To qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, however, we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Furthermore, to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term 
 18 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities. 
 
 Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 The terms of our various credit agreements, including our credit facilities and term loans, the indentures under which certain of our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. These covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, our business and financial condition generally and, in particular, the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected. 
 
 Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our credit ratings were A3 from Moody s with a stable outlook and A from S&P with a stable outlook. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. 
 
 The credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. 
 
 We may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments. 
 
 We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements. 
 
 Our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the OP. 
 
 Any additional future issuance of common stock or OP units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or OP units and the utilization of the proceeds, our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units. 
 
 Risks Related to Income Tax 
 
 The failure of Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences. 
 
 Prologis, Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe Prologis, Inc. has been organized and operated to qualify as a REIT under the IRC and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the IRC to enable Prologis, Inc. to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause Prologis, Inc. to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the IRC for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, Prologis, Inc. must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, Prologis, Inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or 
 19 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. The provisions of the I RC and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated for Prologis, Inc. because we hold substantially all of our assets through the OP. 
 
 If Prologis, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including, for taxable years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, Prologis, Inc. would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election if recognized within the five-year period after re-election, and potentially 10 years for certain states. If Prologis, Inc. lost its REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distributions would be reduced. 
 
 Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs that elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT 95 and 75 gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the ability of Prologis, Inc. to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus its ability to qualify as a REIT. 
 
 In addition, we may acquire properties through the acquisition of REIT entities that own the real estate. If a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions, and such entities were to fail to satisfy the REIT requirements for any year, they would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which the REIT qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election or, if earlier, at the time of Prologis acquisition of the assets. A sale of such assets within the 5-year recognition period, and potentially 10 years for certain states, could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant. 
 
 Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. 
 
 From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the IRC, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service IRS may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT. 
 
 Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us. 
 
 In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S., state, local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate, REITs, similar entities and investments. Additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future, both in and outside of the U.S. and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders. Any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. 
 
 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. 
 
 Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the IRC, no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 Our business may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of global pandemics. 
 
 We cannot predict the extent to which global pandemics may impact our business and operating results and that of our co-investment ventures, but their impact may include the following: 
 
 20 
 
 Table of Contents 

Existing customers and potential customers of our logistics facilities may be adversely affected by the decrease in economic activity, which in turn could disrupt their business and their ability to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments 

Government, labor or other restrictions may prevent us from completing the development or leasing of properties currently under development or making our properties ready for our customers to move in 

Our ability to recover our investments in real estate assets may be impacted by current market conditions 

Increases in material costs as a result of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions may make the development of properties more costly than we originally budgeted and 

Our workforce, including our executives, may become ill or have difficulty working remotely, caring for our properties and/or customers. 

Any prolonged economic downturn, escalation of the outbreak or disruption in the financial markets may also impact our ability to access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing or at all. 
 
 These items may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and real estate values. 
 
 Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks. 
 
 Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as malware, ransomware, or unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Third-party security events at vendors, sub-processors, and service providers could also impact our data and operations via unauthorized access to information or disruption of services which may ultimately result in financial losses. Despite training, detection systems and response procedures, an increase in email attacks (phishing and business email compromise) may create disruption to our business and financial risk. 
 
 Although security incidents have had an insignificant financial impact on our operating results, the growing frequency of attempts may lead to increased costs to protect the company and respond to any events, including additional personnel, consultants and protection technologies. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. Additionally, remediation costs for security events may not be covered by our insurance. 
 
 Risks associated with our dependence on key personnel. 
 
 We depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities. 
 
 We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and could be required to implement new or stricter regulations, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. 
 
 We are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our logistics facilities and the global supply chain may be exposed to catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases, our exposure to these events could increase. We may also be adversely impacted by transition risks, such as potential impacts to the supply chain as a real estate developer or changes in laws and regulations, such as stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral.

 GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION 
 
 We predominately invest in logistics facilities. Our properties are typically used for distribution, storage, packaging, assembly and light manufacturing of consumer products. The vast majority of our operating properties are used by our customers for retail and online fulfillment and business-to-business transactions. 
 
 The following tables provide details of our consolidated operating properties, investment in land and development portfolio and our O&M portfolio. The O&M portfolio includes the properties we consolidate and the properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures reflected at 100 of the amount included in the ventures financial statements as calculated on a GAAP basis, not our proportionate share. 
 
 Included in the operating property information below for our consolidated operating properties are 498 buildings owned primarily by one co-investment venture that we consolidate but of which we own less than 100 of the equity. No individual property or market amounted to 10 or more of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2022, or generated revenue equal to 10 or more of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the exception of the Southern California market.

 Certain of our consolidated properties are pledged as security under secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds. For purposes of this table, the total principal balance of a debt issuance that is secured by a pool of properties is allocated among the properties in the pool based on each property s investment balance. In addition to the amounts reflected here, we also have 184 million of encumbrances related to two properties under development, one prestabilized property, two other real estate investments and one land parcel included in the consolidated portfolio.

 Included in our consolidated operating properties are properties that we consider to be held for contribution and are presented within Assets Held for Sale or Contribution in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We include these properties in our operating portfolio as they are expected to be contributed to our co-investment ventures and remain in our O&M operating portfolio. At December 31, 2022, we had investments in real estate properties that were expected to be contributed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures totaling 489 million and aggregating 4 million square feet. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on our Assets Held for Sale or Contribution.

 TEI is based on current projections and is subject to change. As noted in the table below, our current investment in the development portfolio was 4.2 billion, leaving approximately 3.3 billion of additional required investment. At December 31, 2022, based on TEI, approximately 9 of the properties in the development portfolio were completed but not yet stabilized, 72 of the properties were expected to be completed before December 31, 2023, and the remaining properties were expected to be completed before November 2024.

 MANAGEMENT S OVERVIEW 
 
 Summary of 2022 
 
 In 2022, our operating results were robust and we ended the year in a solid financial position. Strong demand and low vacancy in the global logistics markets drove increases in market rents throughout the year, which translated into significant rent change on rollover and same-store growth in our O&M portfolio. Our O&M operating portfolio occupancy was 98.2 at December 31, 2022 and rent change on leases commenced during 2022 was 48.0 , on a net effective basis, based on our ownership share. Our 2022 results are representative of the prospects we see for our business despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets, ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe that are all pressuring the global economy. Due to current market conditions, we expect some decline in asset valuations in 2023 and therefore will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate capital deployment activities , including a focus on build-to-suit developments and a pause on contributions into our open-ended funds in the near term. We believe we are well-positioned to organically grow revenues given the increase in market rents over the last several years and our high lease mark-to-market. However, we will be cautious as we manage our business in this uncertain environment. 
 
 We completed the following significant activities in 2022, as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: 

On October 3, 2022, we completed the Duke Transaction for 23.2 billion through the issuance of equity and assumption of debt. We assumed 4.2 billion of debt with a weighted average stated interest rate of 2.3 and 4.9 at fair value. We paid down the balance of 745 million on Duke s line of credit subsequent to closing the acquisition. The Duke portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144 million square feet. 

We generated net proceeds of 2.7 billion and realized net gains of 1.2 billion, principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan and dispositions of non-strategic assets to third parties, primarily in the U.S. 

We earned promotes aggregating 505 million 386 million net of related strategic capital expenses), primarily during the third quarter of 2022 from the third-party investors in PELF in Europe. 

With the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we operate, in 2022 we realized net gains upon settlement of undesignated derivative instruments that offset the negative impact of the translation of our earnings to U.S. dollars. 

In June, we terminated our global senior credit facility (the 2019 Global Facility and entered into the 2022 Global Facility with a borrowing capacity of up to 3.0 billion and an extended initial maturity date of June 2026. We also upsized our second global senior credit facility (the 2021 Global Facility ), increasing its borrowing capacity up to 2.0 billion. This resulted in increasing our total borrowing capacity under both facilities to 5.0 billion and modifying the base rate of the aggregate lender commitments in U.S. dollars from the U.S. dollar London Inter-bank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 

At December 31, 2022, we had total available liquidity of 4.1 billion, with aggregate availability under our credit facilities of 3.9 billion and unrestricted cash balances of 278 million.

At December 31, 2022, we had total senior notes of 19.8 billion, with a weighted average remaining maturity of 10 years and an effective interest rate of 2.3 . In addition to the senior notes assumed in the Duke Transaction, we issued 3.3 billion of senior notes in 2022 (principal in millions):

 A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to finance green projects eligible under our green bond framework. 

On October 6, 2022, we completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation for nine series of Duke s senior notes for an aggregate amount of 3.4 billion, with 3.2 billion, or 96 , of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange. The validly tendered senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by the OP. As a result of the consent solicitation, we have no separate remaining financial reporting obligations or financial covenants associated with the senior notes assumed in the Duke Transaction. All other terms of the assumed Duke senior notes remained substantially the same. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.

Real Estate Segment 
 
 This operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Real Estate Segment through Rental Expenses and the Strategic Capital Segment through Strategic Capital Expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. In addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.

Real Estate Segment NOI

The change in Real Estate Segment RES NOI in 2022 compared to 2021 of approximately 583 million was impacted by the following activities (in millions): 

(1) 
 
 Acquisition activity is principally due to the Duke Transaction on October 3, 2022. We primarily recognized intangible liabilities for the lower in-place rents, as compared to current market rents, under the acquired leases from Duke. These intangible liabilities are amortized to rental revenues over the remaining lease term, which on average is 64 months. 

(2) 
 
 During both periods, we experienced positive rental rate growth. Rental rate growth is a combination of higher rental rates on rollover of leases (or rent change) and contractual rent increases on existing leases. If a lease has a contractual rent increase driven by a metric that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore impacts the rental revenue we recognize. Significant rent change during both periods continues to be a key driver in increasing rental income. See below for key metrics on rent change on rollover and occupancy. 

(3) 
 
 We calculate changes in NOI from development completions period over period by comparing the change in NOI generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022.

At December 31, 2022, the consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was expected to be completed before November 2024 with a TEI of 7.5 billion and was 45.2 leased. The development portfolio included 15 buildings that were properties under development by Duke and acquired at the time of the acquisition. Our investment in the development portfolio was 4.2 billion at December 31, 2022 leaving 3.3 billion remaining to be spent. For additional information on our development portfolio at December 31, 2022, see Item 2. Properties.

Capital Expenditures 
 
 We capitalize costs incurred in improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets. The following graph summarizes capitalized expenditures, excluding development costs, of our consolidated operating properties during each year: 

Our capital expenditures continue to increase year over year as we grow the consolidated operating portfolio through development and acquisitions. We plan to continue allocating capital in 2023 to renovate and modernize our operating portfolio, including the addition of sustainable and efficient building features. 
 
 Strategic Capital Segment 
 
 This operating segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services performed, transactional services for acquisition, disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned primarily from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital Segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. These revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital Segment through Strategic Capital Expenses and to the Real Estate Segment through Rental Expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. For further details regarding the key property information and summarized financial condition and operating results of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The U.S. expenses include compensation and personnel costs for employees who are based in the U.S. but also support other geographies.

 Recurring fees include asset management and property management fees. The increase in fees is primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by the increases in the fair value of the properties based on third party valuations. We saw some decline in asset values in the last half of 2022, and we expect to see additional decline in 2023.

 We generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures based on the cumulative returns of the venture over a three-year period or the stabilization of individual development projects owned by the venture. An increase in asset valuations in the co-investment ventures during the promote period is one of the significant drivers of returns that can translate into earning future promote revenues. Included above is promote revenue earned from PELF in September 2022. Approximately 40 of the promote earned by us from the co-investment ventures is paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock-based awards pursuant to the terms of the PPP and expensed through Strategic Capital Expenses, as vested. 

G&A Expenses 
 
 G&A expenses were 331 million and 294 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. G&A expenses increased in 2022 as compared to 2021, principally due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses based on our performance. We expect that 2023 will include additional investments we are making in our Prologis Essentials business, primarily in the energy teams. We capitalize certain internal costs that are incremental and directly related to our development and building improvement activities.

 Included in acquisitions are the operating properties, other real estate properties and related lease intangibles acquired in the Duke Transaction. 

Gains on Real Estate Transactions, Net 
 
 Gains on the disposition of development properties and land were 598 million and 817 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily included gains from the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan for 2022 and additionally in the U.S. for 2021. Gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate were 589 million and 773 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included sales of non-strategic operating properties in the U.S., including properties acquired in the LPT Transaction and the IPT Transaction. Additionally, 2021 included the sale of our ownership interest in one of our 
 32 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 unconsolidated ventures and the contribution of operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment venture in the U.S. We utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our development activities during both periods. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions. 
 
 Our Owned and Managed O&M Operating Portfolio 
 
 We manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&M basis, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the Real Estate Segment and the Strategic Capital Segment, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures operating information does not represent a legal claim. 
 
 Our O&M operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold long-term that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments. Value-added properties are properties we have either acquired at a discount and believe we could provide greater returns post-stabilization or properties we expect to repurpose to a higher and better use.

Below are the key leasing metrics of our O&M operating portfolio. 

(1) 
 
 Square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. We retained approximately 70 or more of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, for each year. In 2022, we experienced a significant increase in net effective rent change due to increasing market rents. 

(2) 
 
 Turnover costs include external leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the lease commencement for leases greater than one year. In 2022, spend on turnover costs remained similar to 2021, however, the value of the leases commenced increased due to strong market rent growth. 

Same Store Analysis 
 
 Our same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below. 
 
 We define our same store population for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as the properties in our O&M operating portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at January 1, 2021 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2021 and 2022. We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the O&M portfolio based on Prologis ownership in the properties Prologis Share ). The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning

 of the period (January 1, 20 2 1 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods. 
 
 As non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of Rental Revenues less Rental Expenses Property NOI (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures. 
 
 We evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property NOI for each quarter in 2022 and 2021 to the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and within Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

 We exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.

In order to calculate our share of Same Store Property NOI from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100 , we use the co-investment ventures underlying Property NOI for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at December 31, 2022 to the Property NOI for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. We adjust the total Property NOI from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures . 

During the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI are comparable period over period. 

(3) 
 
 We further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to reflect a Same Store Property NOI Cash measure. 

We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O&M portfolio at 100 as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. We calculate those results by including 100 of the properties included in our same store portfolio. 
 
 Other Components of Income (Expense) 
 
 Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net 
 
 We recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of 311 million and 404 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in 2021 is our share of the gains recognized upon the sale of certain non-strategic assets acquired in the IPT Transaction and the sale by UKLV of its operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, PELF and PELP. 
 
 The earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt (iv) our ownership interest in each venture and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars. See the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the Strategic Capital Segment discussion and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

Interest expense increased in 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to assuming 4.2 billion of debt in the Duke Transaction with a weighted average interest rate at fair value of 4.9 , which included 2.9 billion of senior notes and a 501 million term loan. Additionally, we issued 3.3 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.3 , at the issuance date, in 2022. 
 
 See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs. 
 
 Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 We recognized foreign currency and derivative gains (losses) and other income (expense), net, of 242 million and 165 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk related to our investments by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge. We recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the translation adjustment on the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our earnings. We recognize the change in fair value of the

 undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses. Upon settlement of these transactions, we recognize realized gains or losses.

 Losses on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net 
 
 We recognized 20 million and 187 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The losses in 2021 included the redemption of 1.5 billion of senior notes with stated maturities between 2024 and 2025. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, for more information regarding our debt. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 We recognize income tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and in the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our current income tax expense (benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income, including gains on the disposition of properties and fees earned from the co-investment ventures. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.

 Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 This amount represents the third-party investors share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period. We had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of 191 million and 209 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in these amounts were 92 million and 82 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of Prologis, L.P. Included in 2021 was the sale of non-strategic operating properties in our consolidated co-investment venture in the U.S. 
 
 See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.

 Table of Contents 

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 
 The key driver of changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) AOCI/L in 2022 and 2021 was the currency translation adjustment derived from changes in exchange rates during both periods primarily on our net investments in real estate outside the U.S. and the borrowings we issue in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest. These borrowings serve as a natural hedge of our foreign investments. In addition, we use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign investments and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, that when designated the change in fair value is included in AOCI/L . 
 
 See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions and other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 See Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about environmental liabilities. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements. 
 
 Given the uncertain macro environment and the impact on real estate valuations, we expect to be cautious as we evaluate capital deployment activities, including a focus on build-to-suit developments and a pause on contributions in the near term. 
 
 Near-Term Principal Cash Sources and Uses 
 
 In addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following: 

completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at December 31, 2022, 136 properties in our development portfolio were 45.2 leased with a current investment of 4.2 billion and a TEI of 7.5 billion when completed and leased, leaving 3.3 billion of estimated additional required investment) 

development of new properties that we may hold for long-term investment or subsequently contribute to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including the acquisition of land 

the acquisition of other real estate investments that we acquire with the intention of redeveloping into industrial properties 

capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio, including investments in solar panels and other renewable energy improvements 

repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of 33 million in 2023 

additional investments in current and future unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures and 

the acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our unconsolidated entities). In October 2022, we completed the Duke Transaction for 23.2 billion through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. 

We expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions): 

net cash flow from property operations 

fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures 

distributions received from co-investment ventures 

proceeds from the contribution of properties to current or future co-investment ventures 

proceeds from the disposition of properties or other investments to third parties

borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements 3.9 billion available at December 31, 2022) and 

proceeds from the issuance of debt. 

Long-term, we may also voluntarily repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. We may also fund our cash needs from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions, and the through sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures.

 The weighted average remaining maturity for total debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 9 and 10 years, respectively. 

Our credit ratings at December 31, 2022, were A3 from Moody s with a stable outlook and A from Standard & Poor s with a stable outlook. These ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. These covenants include a number of customary financial covenants , such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. 
 
 See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt. 
 
 Equity Commitments Related to Certain Co-Investment Ventures 
 
 Certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by and used in operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities: 

Real Estate Segment. We receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our Real Estate Segment, including the recovery of our operating costs. Cash flows generated by the Real Estate Segment are impacted by our acquisition, development and disposition activities, which are drivers of NOI recognized during each period. See the Results of Operations section above for further explanation of our Real Estate Segment. The revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of 268 million and 148 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Strategic Capital Segment. We also generate operating cash through our Strategic Capital Segment by providing asset management and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See the Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our Strategic Capital Segment. Included in Strategic Capital Revenues is the third-party investors share that is owed for promotes, which is recognized in operating activities in the period the cash is received, generally the quarter after the revenue is recognized. 

G&A expenses and equity-based compensation awards. We incurred 331 million and 294 million of G&A expenses in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of 175 million and 113 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were recorded to Rental Expenses in the Real Estate Segment, Strategic Capital Expenses in the Strategic Capital Segment and G&A Expenses. 

Operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. We received 410 million and 440 million of distributions as a return on our investment from the cash flows generated from the operations of our unconsolidated entities in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized. We paid interest, net of amounts capitalized, of 234 million and 279 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this activity. 

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds. We paid income taxes, net of refunds, of 130 million and 149 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this activity. 

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from the sale of real estate assets that include the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures as well as the sale of operating properties. Contribution and disposition activity in 2022 was significantly lower than in 2021 due to the sale of non-strategic assets in 2021 and a pause on contributions in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures as discussed above. Acquisition activity includes land for future development, operating properties and other real estate assets. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these activities. In addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash used in and provided by investing activities: 

Duke Transaction, net of cash acquired . We paid net cash of 92 million to complete the Duke Transaction in 2022, primarily due to transaction costs. The acquisition was financed through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. A portion of this debt was paid down subsequent to the acquisition, see the Financing Activities section below. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this transaction. 

Investments in and advances to our unconsolidated entities. We invested cash in our unconsolidated entities that represented our proportionate share, of 442 million and 798 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ventures used the funds for the acquisition of properties, development and repayment of debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

 Table of Contents 

Return of investment from unconsolidated entities. We received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of 77 million and 58 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in these amounts were distributions from venture activities including proceeds from property sales, debt refinancing and the redemption of our investment in certain unconsolidated entities. 

Net proceeds from (payments on) the settlement of net investment hedges. We received 56 million and paid 13 million for the settlement of net investment hedges in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative transactions. 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt, along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions. 
 
 Our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity (in millions):

We paid down the balance of 745 million on Duke s line of credit subsequent to closing the acquisition which is reflected in Net proceeds from (payments on) credit facilities . The assumption of debt was excluded from this table . 

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Venture Debt 
 
 We had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures of 8.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The ventures listed below had total third-party debt of 13.5 billion at December 31, 2022 with a weighted average remaining maturity of 7 years and weighted average interest rate of 2.8 . Certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded.

 The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 26.3 at December 31, 2022. Loan-to-value, a non-GAAP measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 

At December 31, 2022, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.

Dividend and Distribution Requirements 
 
 Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the IRC, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund our capital deployment and other investment activities. 
 
 Under the IRC, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. 
 
 We paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.79 and 0.63 per common share in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year. 
 
 We make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. The Class A common limited partnership units Class A Units in the OP are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 0.40 per unit. We paid a quarterly cash distribution of 0.64665 per Class A Unit in 2022 and 2021. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our Series Q preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of 8.54 per share and the dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 
 On an ongoing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 A critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity s financial condition and results of operations. Management s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies as they relate to our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and our operating results for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies. 
 
 Asset Acquisitions 
 
 We generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. We measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged. The difference between the cost and the estimated fair value (excess or bargain consideration) is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. Assets we do not intend to hold long-term are recorded at fair value. At a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components, which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. The most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions. 
 
 The fair value of real estate properties subject to purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income of a property. Key assumptions may include market rents and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. The use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the depreciation expense we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life. 
 
 Recoverability of Real Estate Assets 
 
 We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the 
 41 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net operating income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment.

 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS FFO 
 
 FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. 
 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties share of our consolidated co-investment ventures. 
 
 Our FFO Measures 
 
 Our FFO measures begin with NAREIT s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis and Core FFO , both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook. 
 
 We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods. 
 
 These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs. 
 
 We analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. 
 
 FFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders FFO, as modified by Prologis 
 
 To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis , we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically: 

deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries 

current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure and 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (i) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (ii) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (iii) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (iv) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments. 

42 
 
 Table of Contents 

We use FFO, as modified by Prologis , so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
 
 Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders Core FFO 
 
 In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis , we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis , to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis : 

gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell 

income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate 

impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties 

gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock and 

expenses related to natural disasters. 

We use Core FFO , including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods (iii) evaluate the performance of our management (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. 
 
 Limitations on the use of our FFO measures 
 
 While we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are: 

The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable. 

Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO. 

Gains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions. 

The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement. 

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements. 

The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation. 

The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred. 

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP as follows (in millions):

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange-related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes. See our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors, specifically Risks Related to our Global Operations and Risks Related to Financing and Capital. See also Notes 2 and 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments. 
 
 We monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at December 31, 2022. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, revenues and expenses, as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. Additionally, we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. At December 31, 2022, after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, 975 million or 16 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries. We have forward contracts that were not designated as hedges, denominated principally in British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen, and have an aggregate notional amount of 1.6 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies. The gain or loss on settlement of these contracts is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated U.S. dollar earnings from these currencies, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10 could result in a 164 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts.

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. To mitigate that risk, we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2022, 21.1 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, 3.3 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates.

 At December 31, 2022, we had one interest rate swap agreement to fix 150 million 156 million) of our floating rate euro senior notes which is included in fixed rate debt.

 The weighted average interest rates represent the effective interest rates (including amortization of debt issuance costs and noncash premiums and discounts) at December 31, 2022 for the debt outstanding and include the impact of designated interest rate swaps, which effectively fix the interest rate on certain variable rate debt . 

At December 31, 2022, the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 2.5 , which was calculated using an average balance on our credit facilities throughout the year and our other variable rate debt balances at December 31, 2022. Changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a 10 increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of 6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which equates to a change in interest rates of 25 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and 2 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in Prologis, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Prologis, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting was conducted at December 31, 2022, based on the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, at December 31, 2022, the internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein. 
 
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Prologis, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Prologis, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of the Company s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company had 69,039 million of operating properties as of December 31, 2022. The Company tests the recoverability of operating properties whenever events or changes in circumstances, including shortening the expected holding period of such assets, indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We identified the assessment of the Company s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the relevant events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected holding period. A shortening of the expected holding period could indicate a potential impairment. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to determining the expected holding period of operating properties and any related changes. We evaluated the Company s expected holding period by inquiring of the Company regarding changes to the expected holding period, considering certain factors related to the current economic environment, reading minutes of the meetings of the Company s Board of Directors, reading external communications with investors and analysts, and analyzing documents prepared by the Company regarding proposed real estate transactions and potential changes to the expected holding period. 
 Duke Realty transaction 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 3, 2022 Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively the Duke Realty transaction for 23.2 billion and the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Company measures the real estate assets acquired based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess or bargain consideration is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The components of the acquisition include an initial allocation to investments in real estate properties acquired based on fair value and an initial allocation of that fair value to buildings and land. The Company determines fair value of the real estate properties based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income of a property. We identified the evaluation of the fair value allocated to investments in real estate properties acquired, including the allocation of the property fair value to land and building, in the Duke Realty transaction as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the fair value amounts estimated by the Company in the allocation involved complex auditor judgment as a result of measurement uncertainty. Specifically, testing significant assumptions of market rents and capitalization rates related to investments in real estate and testing the allocation of property fair value to land and building required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s fair value estimation process for investments in real estate properties, including land and building. This included controls related to the determination of amounts allocated to land and building and determination of market rents and capitalization rates used to estimate the fair value of investments in real estate properties. For a selection of investments in real estate properties we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Prologis, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Prologis, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P. 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 operating business segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Segment represents the ownership, leasing and development of logistics properties. Our Strategic Capital Segment represents the management of properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures. See Note 17 for further discussion of our business segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Parent and the OP. The terms the Company, Prologis, we, our or us means the Parent and OP collectively. 
 
 For each share of preferred or common stock the Parent issues, the OP issues a corresponding preferred or common partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At December 31, 2022, the Parent owned a common general partnership interest in the OP and substantially all of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining common limited partnership interests, which include Class A common limited partnership units Class A Units in the OP, are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. Each partner s percentage interest in the OP is determined based on the number of OP units held, including the number of OP units into which Class A Units are convertible, compared to total OP units outstanding at each period end and is used as the basis for the allocation of net income or loss to each partner. At the end of each reporting period, a capital adjustment is made in the OP to reflect the appropriate ownership interest for each of the common unitholders. These adjustments are reflected in the line items Reallocation of Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Equity of the Parent and Reallocation of Capital in the Consolidated Statements of Capital of the OP. 
 
 As the sole general partner of the OP, the Parent has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the OP and we operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the OP, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP. Because the Parent s only significant asset is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements. 
 
 Information with respect to the square footage, number of buildings and acres of land is unaudited. 
 
 but control the entity, as well as any variable interest entities VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity.

 , or is occupied. We generally use the following useful lives: to for capital improvements, years for standard tenant improvements, to for depreciable land improvements, to for operating properties acquired based on the age of the building and years for operating properties we develop. We depreciate building improvements on land parcels subject to land leases over the shorter of the estimated life of the building improvement or the contractual term of the underlying land lease. Capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the estimated remaining lease term. The weighted average lease term for leases that commenced during 2022, based on square feet, was months. 
 
 Capitalization of Costs. During the land development and construction periods of qualifying projects, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and general and administrative costs of the personnel performing the development if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to ready the asset for its intended use. We capitalize transaction costs related to the acquisition of land for future development and operating properties that qualify as asset acquisitions. We capitalize incremental, third-party costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from obtaining a lease and would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of Other Assets and all other capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of the real estate assets. 
 
 Recoverability of Real Estate Assets. We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net operating income from the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment. 
 
 At least annually or more frequently given the presence of a triggering event, we measure the recoverability of our assets. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the fair value based on our intent as follows: 

for real estate properties that we intend to hold long-term including land held for development, properties currently under development and operating properties recoverability is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future net operating income from the property and the terminal value, including anticipated costs to develop 

for real estate properties we intend to sell, including properties currently under development and operating properties recoverability is assessed based on proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on the future net operating income from the property, expected market capitalization rates and anticipated costs to develop 

for land parcels we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on the estimated proceeds from disposition and 

for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of land and operating properties and future development projects, recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur at the measurement date.

 of the equity and recognize the difference between the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the consideration paid or received as additional paid-in-capital . 
 
 Certain limited partnership interests, including OP units, are exchangeable into our common stock. Common stock issued upon exchange of a holder s noncontrolling interest is accounted for at the carrying value of the surrendered limited partnership interest and the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the common stock issued is recorded to additional paid-in-capital.

of our taxable income, and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. REITs which meet these certain income, asset and stockholder tests are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute of their taxable income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to certain foreign, state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. 
 
 We have elected taxable REIT subsidiary TRS status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize REITs or do not accord REIT status under their respective tax laws to our entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the U.S., we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. 
 
 We evaluate tax positions taken in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities. 
 
 We recognize deferred income taxes in certain taxable entities. For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax-free transactions resulting in a carry-over tax basis in assets and liabilities. For financial reporting purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair value at date of acquisition, as discussed above. For our taxable subsidiaries, including certain international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at date of acquisition. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, are reflected in earnings.

, we acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively Duke or the Duke Transaction ). Through the Duke Transaction, we acquired a portfolio primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144.4 million square feet, which are highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential in our key markets . There was approximately 15 million square feet of non-strategic operating industrial properties acquired in the Duke Transaction for which our intent is not to operate these properties long-term. These assets are classified as Other Real Estate Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and investments in other ventures. 
 
 The Duke Transaction was completed for billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis common stock and units issued of billion, the assumption of debt of billion and transaction costs.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures 
 
 Certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. The commitments are generally used for the acquisition or development of properties but may be used for the repayment of debt or other general uses. The venture may obtain financing for the acquisition of properties and therefore the acquisition price of additional investments that the venture could make may be more than the equity commitment. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the ventures, our liquidity needs and other factors, we may make additional contributions of properties or additional cash investments in these ventures.

 billion (subject to currency fluctuations). We also upsized our second global senior credit facility (the 2021 Global Facility ), increasing its borrowing capacity to billion (subject to currency fluctuations). We may draw on both facilities in British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos and U.S. dollars on a revolving basis. During the recast of both facilities, we modified the base rate of the aggregate lender commitments in U.S. dollars from the U.S. dollar London Inter-bank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The 2021 Global Facility is scheduled to initially mature in and the 2022 Global Facility in however, we can extend the maturity date for each facility by six months on two occasions, subject to the payment of extension fees. We have the ability to increase the 2021 Global Facility to billion and the 2022 Global Facility to billion, subject to currency fluctuations and obtaining additional lender commitments. 
 
 We also have a Japanese yen revolver (the Yen Credit Facility with total commitments of billion million at December 31, 2022).

On October 6, 2022, we completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation for nine series of Duke s senior notes for an aggregate amount of billion, with billion, or , of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange. The validly tendered senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by the OP. As a result of the consent solicitation, we have no separate remaining financial reporting obligations or financial covenants associated with the senior notes assumed in the Duke Transaction. All other terms of the assumed Duke senior notes remained substantially the same. 
 
 Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 
 We repurchased, redeemed or repaid certain debt before the maturity date in an effort to reduce our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. As a result, the difference between the recorded debt (including premiums, discounts and related debt issuance costs) and the consideration we paid to retire the debt, including fees, was recognized as gains or losses. Fees associated with the restructuring of debt that meets the modification criteria, along with existing unamortized premium or discount and debt issuance costs, are amortized over the term of the new debt . 
 
 We recognized million, million and million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The losses during 2021 and 2020 were driven by the redemption of certain higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturity. We redeemed billion of senior notes in 2021, with stated maturities of 2024 and 2025, and billion of senior notes in 2020, with stated maturities between 2021 and 2024. The losses in 2020 also included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Liberty Transaction and IPT Transaction, which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt.

There are no restrictions or limits on the OP s ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.

 billion shares were authorized to be issued by the Parent, of which billion shares represent common stock and billion shares represent preferred stock. Our board of directors (the Board may, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our stock from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of such shares. 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 Our at-the-market program allows us to sell up to billion in aggregate gross sales proceeds of shares of common stock through designated agents. These agents earn a fee of up to of the gross sales price per share of common stock as agreed to on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We have t issued any shares of common stock under this program. 
 
 On October 3, 2022, we issued million common shares in the Duke Transaction. On February 4, 2020, we issued 106.7 million common shares in the Liberty Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions. 
 
 Under the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan, certain of our employees and outside directors are able to participate in equity-based compensation plans. See Note 12 for additional information on equity-based compensation plans. 
 
 Share Purchase Program 
 
 We have a share purchase program for the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of up to billion. In 2020, we repurchased and retired million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of million at a weighted average price of per share on the open market. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 In 2020, we repurchased approximately million shares of Series Q preferred stock and recognized a loss of million, which primarily represented the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred stock, net of original issuance costs. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021 our Series Q preferred stock outstanding had a dividend rate of and will be redeemable at our option on or after November 13, 2026. Holders have, subject to certain conditions, limited voting rights and all holders are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based on liquidation preference. The dividends are payable quarterly when, and if, they have been declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. 
 
 Ownership Restrictions 
 
 For us to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals may not own more than of the value of our outstanding stock at any time during the last half of our taxable year. Therefore, our charter restricts beneficial ownership (or ownership generally attributed to a person under the REIT rules), by a person, or persons acting as a group, of issued and outstanding common and preferred stock that would cause that person to own or be deemed to own more than (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our issued and outstanding common stock. Furthermore, subject to certain exceptions, no person shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than of any of the preferred stock. These provisions assist us in protecting and preserving our REIT status and protect the interests of stockholders in takeover transactions by preventing the acquisition of a substantial block of outstanding shares of stock. 
 
 Shares of stock owned by a person or group of people in excess of these limits are subject to redemption by us. The provision does not apply where a majority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, waives such limit after determining that our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes will not be jeopardized. 
 
 Dividends 
 To comply with the REIT requirements of the IRC, we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal (i) the sum of (a) of our REIT taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90 of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) certain excess noncash income. Our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the IRC and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment activities. 
 The taxability of our dividends for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented below. The taxability of dividends paid in 2022 was based on management s estimates as our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2022 has not been filed. As the

Common stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, qualified dividend, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital or a combination of the four. Common stock dividends that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the stockholder s basis in the common stock. To the extent that a dividend exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in the common stock, it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s common stock. At the beginning of each year, we notify our stockholders of the taxability of the common stock dividends paid during the preceding year. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock. 
 million common limited partnership units in the OP in the Duke Transaction. On February 4, 2020, we issued million common limited partnership units in the OP in the Liberty Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions. Additionally, we issued million limited partnership units to our partner as partial consideration for the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an unconsolidated other venture in 2021 and million limited partnership units as partial consideration for the acquisition of other properties in 2020. 
 
 We issued Class A Units in the OP through an acquisition of a portfolio of properties in 2015. The Class A Units generally have the same rights as the existing common limited partnership units of the OP, except that the Class A Units are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to per unit so long as the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of at least per unit (in the event the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of less than 0.40 per unit, the Class A Unit distribution would be reduced by a proportionate amount). Class A Units are convertible into common limited partnership units at an initial conversion rate of one-for-one. The conversion rate will be increased or decreased to the extent that, at the time of conversion, the net present value of the distributions paid with respect to the Class A Units are less or more than the distributions paid on common limited partnership units from the time of issuance of the Class A Units until the time of conversion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Class A Units were convertible into million common limited partnership units. The OP may redeem the Class A Units at any time after October 7, 2025, for an amount in cash equal to the then-current number of the common limited partnership units into which the Class A Units are convertible, multiplied by , subject to the holders right to convert the Class A Units into common limited partnership units. Distributions paid to the Class A Units were annually during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 As discussed in Note 1, the Parent has complete responsibility, power and discretion in the day-to-day management of the OP. The Parent, through its majority interest, has the right to receive benefits from and incur losses of the OP. In addition, the OP does not have either substantive liquidation rights or substantive kick-out rights without cause or substantive participating rights that could be exercised by a simple majority of noncontrolling interests. The absence of such rights renders the OP as a VIE. Accordingly, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP.

 The noncontrolling interests of the Parent include the noncontrolling interests described above for the OP, as well as the limited partnership units in the OP that are not owned by the Parent.

 Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs 
 
 Prologis Outperformance Plan POP 
 
 We have allocated participation points or a percentage of the compensation pool to participants under our POP corresponding to three-year performance periods beginning every January 1. The fair value of the awards is measured at the grant date and amortized over the period from the grant date to the date at which the awards vest, which ranges from to . The performance hurdle Outperformance Hurdle at the end of the initial three-year performance period requires our three-year compound annualized total stockholder return TSR to exceed a threshold set at the three-year compound annualized TSR for the Morgan Stanley Capital International MSCI US REIT Index for the same period plus basis points. If the Outperformance Hurdle is met, a compensation pool will be formed equal to of the excess value created, subject to a maximum as defined by each performance period. POP awards cannot be paid at a time when we meet the outperformance hurdle yet our absolute TSR is negative. If after our absolute TSR has not been positive, the awards will be forfeited. 
 
 We granted participation points for the 2022 2024 performance period in January 2022, as discussed in the table below. The 2022 2024 performance period has an absolute maximum cap of million. If an award is earned at the end of the initial three-year performance period, then of the POP award is paid at the end of the initial performance period and the remaining is subject to additional seven-year cliff vesting. The 20 that is paid at the end of the initial three-year performance period is subject to an additional three-year holding requirement. 
 
 Each participant is eligible to receive a percentage of the total compensation pool based on the number of participation points allocated to the participant, or in the case of certain executive officers, a set percentage of the compensation pool. If the performance criteria are met, the participants points or compensation pool percentage will be paid in the form of common stock, restricted stock units, POP LTIP Units or LTIP Units, as elected by the participant. Annually, a participant may exchange their participation points or compensation pool percentage for POP LTIP Units. If the performance criteria are not met, the participants points, compensation pool percentage and POP LTIP Units will be forfeited. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , all awards were equity classified. The initial valuation was calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

The tables below include POP awards that were earned but are unvested while any vested awards are reflected within the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Capital. The initial grant date fair value derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model was used in determining the grant date fair value per unit in the award tables below. 
 
 Other Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs 
 
 Awards may be issued in the form of RSUs or LTIP Units at the participants elections under the following equity-based compensation plans and programs. RSUs and LTIP Units are valued based on the market price of the Parent s common stock on the date the award is granted and the grant date value is charged to compensation expense over the service period. The service period is generally , except for awards under the annual bonus exchange program. Dividends and distributions are paid with respect to both RSUs and LTIP Units during the vesting period, and therefore they are considered participating securities. We do not allocate undistributed earnings to participating securities as our net earnings per share or unit would not be materially different. The value of the dividend is charged to retained earnings for RSUs and the distribution is charged to Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the OP for LTIP Units in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent. 
 
 Prologis Promote Plan PPP 
 
 Under the PPP, we establish a compensation pool for certain employees up to of the third-party portion of promotes earned by Prologis from the co-investment ventures. The awards may be settled in some combination of cash and full value awards, at our election. 
 
 Annual LTI Equity Award Program Annual LTI Award 
 
 The Annual LTI Award provides for grants to certain employees subject to our performance against benchmark indices that relate to the most recent year s performance. 
 
 Annual Bonus Exchange Program 
 
 Under our bonus exchange program, generally all our employees may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash bonus in equity. Equity awards granted through the bonus exchange are valued at a premium to the cash bonus exchanged and vest over three years, excluding certain executive officers. As certain executive officers do not receive a bonus exchange premium for participating in the bonus exchange program, the equity they receive upon exchange for their cash bonuses does not have a vesting period.

 Other Plans 
 
 In 2020, the Prologis 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan was amended to provide for a new matching employer contribution of for every dollar contributed by an employee, up to of the employee s annual compensation (within the statutory compensation limit). The matching employer contribution was previously up to of the employee s annual compensation. In the 401(k) Plan, vesting in the matching employer contributions is based on the employee s years of service, with vesting at the completion of of service. Our contributions under the matching provisions were million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 We have a non-qualified savings plan that allows highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a certain portion of their compensation in excess of the amount permitted under the 401(k) Plan. There has been no employer matching within this plan in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022.

 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we believe that we had complied with the REIT requirements of the IRC. The statute of limitations for our tax returns is generally three years. As such, our tax returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2019 and thereafter. Liabilities or any related settlements for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The change in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the periods presented was due to the translation into U.S. dollars from the consolidation of the financial statements of our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of the effective portion of our derivative financial instruments that have been designated as net investment hedges and cash flow hedges and the translation of the hedged portion of our debt, as discussed above, are also included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 We estimate an additional expense of million will be reclassified to Interest Expense over the next 12 months from December 31, 2022, due to the amortization of previously settled derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

 Included in the year ended December 31, 2020, was million in losses associated with the termination of four U.S. dollar treasury lock contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that fixed the interest rate on the forecasted issuance of U.S. dollar senior notes, which were then issued in February 2020. 

Fair Value Measurements 
 
 We have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. See Note 2 for more information on our fair value measurements policy. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, other than the derivatives discussed previously, we had no significant financial assets or financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our derivatives held at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements on Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Acquired properties and assets we expect to sell or contribute are significant nonfinancial assets that met the criteria to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as detailed in our accounting policy in Note 2. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we estimated the fair value of our properties using Level 2 or Level 3 inputs from the fair value hierarchy. See more information on our acquired properties in Notes 3 and 4 and assets held for sale or contribution in Note 6.

 The outcome under these agreements is uncertain as it depends on the method and timing of dissolution of the related venture or disposition of any properties by the venture. We record liabilities related to the indemnification agreements in Other Liabilities . We continue to monitor these agreements and the likelihood of the sale of assets that would result in recognition and will adjust the potential liability in the future as facts and circumstances dictate. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities 
 
 We have issued performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit in connection with certain development projects. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire on the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had million and million, respectively, outstanding under such arrangements. 
 We may be required under capital commitments or we may choose to make additional capital contributions to certain of our unconsolidated entities, representing our proportionate ownership interest, should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund development or acquisition costs, repayment of debt or operational shortfalls. See Note 5 for further discussion related to equity commitments to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

 operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. We generate revenues, earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows: 

Real Estate Segment. This operating segment represents the ownership and development of operating properties and is the largest component of our revenue and earnings. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. Each operating property is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics these properties are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. The Real Estate Segment also includes development activities that lead to rental operations, including land held for development and properties currently under development, and other real estate investments. Within this line of business, we utilize the following: (i) our land bank (ii) the development and leasing expertise of our local teams and (iii) our customer relationships. 

Strategic Capital Segment. This operating segment represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We generate strategic capital revenues primarily from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing and disposition services. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we also earn revenues through promotes periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. Each unconsolidated co-investment venture we manage is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics these ventures are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. 

Reconciliations are presented below for: (i) each reportable business segment s revenues from external customers to Total Revenues (ii) each reportable business segment s net operating income from external customers to Operating Income and Earnings Before Income Taxes and (iii) each reportable business segment s assets to Total Assets . Our chief operating decision makers rely primarily on net operating income and similar measures to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The applicable components of Total Revenues, Operating Income, Earnings Before Income Taxes and Total Assets are allocated to each reportable business segment s revenues, net operating income and assets. Items that are not directly assignable to a segment, such as certain corporate income and expenses, are not allocated but reflected as reconciling items.

We encourage you to read our Articles of Incorporation, Articles Supplementary, Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL and Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL for additional information. 
 
 Authorized Capital Stock 
 
 General. Our authorized capital stock consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of 0.01 per share and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of 0.01 per share. 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 Shares Outstanding. The outstanding shares of our common stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Our common stock is listed under the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PLD. The transfer agent and securities registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. 
 
 Unissued Common Stock. The Articles of Incorporation authorize the board of directors (the Board to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into other classes or series of classes of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations and restrictions on ownership, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or series. 
 
 The issuance of any shares of common stock in future financings, acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution of voting power and relative equity interest of the holders of shares of our common stock and will subject our common stock to prior dividend and liquidation rights of the outstanding shares of the series of preferred stock. 
 
 Restrictions on Ownership. Prologis generally will prohibit ownership by a single stockholder to no more than 9.8 (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. 
 
 Dividend Rights. The Board may declare and pay dividends on our common stock out of funds legally available for that purpose, subject to the rights of holders of preferred stock, as described below. 
 
 Voting Rights. Each outstanding share of common stock will entitle the holder to one vote for all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote at every meeting of the stockholders, including the election of directors. The holders of such shares will possess the exclusive voting power, subject to any resolution adopted by the Board with respect to any other class or series of stock establishing the designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers of such series. 
 
 Holders may vote in person, authorize another person or persons to act by proxy. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, shall constitute a quorum. A quorum, once established, shall be sufficient to approve 
 
 any matter which may properly come before the meeting. Additionally, under MGCL, we generally cannot dissolve, amend our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, merge, sell all or substantially all of our assets, engage in a share exchange or similar transaction in the ordinary course of business unless approved by the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on the matter and our Articles of Incorporation do not provide for a lesser percentage in any situation. 
 
 Voting for the Election of Directors. Each director is to be elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that director s election; provided, if the number of persons properly nominated to serve as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, then each director will be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
 
 Rights and Preferences. Holders of shares of common stock will not have any conversion, exchange, sinking or retirement fund, redemption or appraisal rights or any preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of the Company or cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. 
 
 Rights Upon Liquidation. Upon liquidation, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in assets available for distribution to stockholders after satisfaction of any liquidation preferences of any outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 Shares Outstanding. The outstanding shares of our preferred stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Under our Articles of Incorporation, without further stockholder action, the Board is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by MGCL and DGCL, to provide for the issuance of the shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in such series, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. 
 
 Restriction on Ownership. No person or persons acting as a group at any time may directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25 of the outstanding preferred stock or Prologis may redeem such shares from the holder or holders within 10 days of becoming aware of such activity. 
 
 Redemption Provisions. Prior to November 13, 2026, preferred stock will not be redeemable by Prologis, however, after this date at the option of Prologis, we may redeem the shares in whole at a redemption price of 50 per share. If full cumulative dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment, they may not be redeemed at the option of Prologis except to enforce the ownership restrictions described above as well as to preserve its tax status. 
 
 Dividend Rights. The annual dividend rate is 8.54 per share and dividends are payable in arrears. Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock. 
 
 Voting Rights. The voting rights of preferred stock are limited. If and whenever six quarterly dividends payable on the preferred stock is in arrears, whether or not earned or declared, the number of directors then constituting the Board will be increased by two and the holders of preferred stock, together with the holders of shares of every other class, voting as a single class, regardless of class or series will be entitled to elect two additional directors to serve at annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof. The affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 of the votes entitled to be case by the holders of the preferred stock is required to approve: (i) any changes to the Articles of Incorporation or Articles Supplementary that materially and adversely affects the voting powers, rights or preferences of the preferred stock; (ii) any share exchange, consolidation, or merger that materially and adversely affects the holders of the preferred stock and; (iii) the authorization, reclassification or creation of, or the increase in the authorized amount of, any security ranking senior to the preferred stock in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or in the payment of dividends. 
 
 Rights and Preferences. The preferred stock is not entitled to the benefits of any retirement of sinking fund and the holders have no conversion, redemption or preemption rights. 
 
 Rights Upon Liquidation. Preferred stockholders receive a liquidation preference of 50 per share. 
 
 Anti-takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 
 General. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions, including our ability to limit the actual or constructive ownership of shares of capital stock that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or take-over attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in premium over the market price for the shares held by the stockholders. 
 
 Business Combinations and Control Share Acquisitions Statues. In the Prologis Bylaws we have elected not to be governed by the "business combination" provision of the MGCL or the "control share acquisition" provisions of the MGCL, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company. The Bylaws provide that the Company cannot at a future date determine to be governed by either such provision without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. In addition, such irrevocable resolution adopted by the Board may only be changed by the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

 General. All Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Prologis underneath the Indenture, as defined above. The Notes are issuable in registered form in the form set out in the Indenture with coupons in denominations of 100,000 and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof for U.S. dollar-denominated notes, 100,000 and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof for euro-denominated notes and 100,000 and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof for British pound sterling-denominated notes. None of the Notes are redeemable or convertible at the option of the holders. The Notes do not provide for any sinking fund or analogous provision and are not to be issued upon the exercise of debt warrants. 
 
 Issuance of Additional Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited. The Notes may be issued in one or more series. The additional series would be established pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or supplemental indentures. 
 
 Trustee. The U.S. Bank National Association is the trustee for all securities issued under the Indenture, including the Notes, and is referred to herein as the Trustee. 
 
 Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Security Registrar. The U.S. dollar-denominated notes define the paying agent as any person authorized by Prologis to pay the principal of or any interest on any securities on behalf of Prologis or if no such person is authorized, the paying agent is Prologis. The U.S. dollar-denominated notes also define the transfer agent and security registrar as the Trustee. The euro-denominated notes define the European paying agent and transfer agent as Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch and the European security registrar as Elavon Financial Services Limited. The British pound sterling-denominated notes define U.S. Bank National Association as the transfer agent and security registrar and Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch as the paying agent. 
 
 Voting Rights. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of the holders of the Notes, a person must be a holder of one or more series of Notes or a person appointed by an instrument in writing as a proxy for a holder or holders of one or more such series. At any meeting each holder will be entitled to one vote for each 1,000 principal amount of the Notes. 
 
 Purposes for Which Meetings May Be Called. A meeting of holders may be called at any time to make, give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action. A quorum for a meeting is defined when there is a majority of persons entitled to vote in principal amount of the total Notes. In the absence of a quorum within thirty minutes of the appointed meeting, the meeting will be dissolved or adjourned for a period of 10 days or less. Any resolution presented to a meeting or an adjourned meeting for which a quorum is present may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes and may become binding for all holders, whether present, not present or represented at the meeting. 

The Trustee may make reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable at any meetings in regard to proof of the holding of the Notes, the appointment or proxies, the duties of inspectors of the votes, other evidence of the right to vote and other such matters concerning conduct, including the appointment of a temporary chairman. 
 
 Execution of Supplemental Indentures. The Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture for the purpose of adding, changing or eliminating any provisions to the Base Indenture or related supplemental indentures or to modify the rights of the holders and any related guarantees provided. To do so, the Trustee receives the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Notes. 
 
 Redemption Provisions. The Notes are redeemable in whole at any time at the option of Prologis at a redemption price of equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount Make-Whole Amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed discounted to the date of the redemption on an annual basis at the applicable comparable governmental bond rate plus 20 basis points Redemption Price ). If the notes are redeemed on or after a certain time frame as defined in each note, the price is 100 of the principal amount. 
 
 Payment of Additional Amounts Upon Redemption. All repayments of the Notes will be made by or on behalf of the Company without withholding or deduction for any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, imposed or levied by the United States U.S. or any taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law, Prologis will pay to a holder who is not a U.S. person such additional amounts (the Additional Amounts on the Notes as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Company or the paying agent of the principal of, and premium Tax Redemption Price ), if any, and interest on, the Notes to such holder, after such withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay the Additional Amounts will not apply to certain items as defined in the Indenture. 
 
 Issuance in Euro and British Pound Sterling. Excluding the U.S. dollar-denominated notes, the principal, interest and related Additional Amounts on the euro-denominated and British pound sterling-denominated notes (or Make-Whole Amount, Redemption Price or Tax Redemption Price) is payable in euro or British pound sterling, as applicable in each note s terms. If the euro or British pound sterling is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company s control, then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro or British pound sterling is again available to Prologis. The amount payable on any date in euros or British pound sterling will be converted to U.S. dollars on the second business day , which is not weekend day or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system is open. The rate used would be: 

(1) 
 
 the Market Exchange Rate for euro, which is the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of euros as certified for customs; or the most recently available Market Exchange Rate on or before payment is due; or 

(2) 
 
 the rate mandated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system for British pound sterling, which is based on the most recent U.S. dollar/British pound sterling exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal. If there is no published exchange rate, the rate is determined at Prologis sole discretion for British pound sterling. 

Any payment in respect of the euro-denominated and British pound sterling-denominated notes made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default, as defined below, under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent is responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenomination s. 
 
 Covenants. Under the Indenture, Prologis must maintain specific covenants on a quarterly basis to incur additional debt and continue to perform under the Indenture and not create an Event of Default, including: 

(1) 
 
 all outstanding debt of Prologis on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles must be less than 60 of the sum of total assets as of the quarter covered by the Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; 

(2) 
 
 the consolidated income available for debt service, as defined in the Indenture, to the annual debt service charge for four consecutive fiscal quarters as of the most recently ended period must be greater than 1.5, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the application of proceeds from the incurrence or refinance of additional debt had it occurred at the beginning of such period; 

(3) 
 
 the total unencumbered assets may not at any time be equal to or less than 150 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the unsecured debt; 

(4) 
 
 total debt secured by any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind upon any of the property to total assets cannot be equal to or greater than 40 of all outstanding debt; and 

(5) 
 
 debt will be deemed to be incurred by the Company or subsidiary whenever the Company or subsidiary will create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable. 

Events of Default. As described in the Indenture, there are many reasons for events of default, including but not limited to default in payment of principal and any premium when a series of Notes is due and payable at maturity, default in the payment of interest or any Additional Amounts payable, default in performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Company in the Indenture, default of 
 
 other indebtedness of the Company, the court entering into a final judgment or decree in an aggregate amount, excluding insurance, in excess of 50,000,000 and such charges remaining for 60 days and the court entering into an order or decree of bankruptcy law. 
 
 If an event of default under the Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, then in every such case, unless the principal of the debt securities of such series shall already have become due and payable, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of such series of debt securities may declare the principal and the make-whole amount on the debt securities of such series to be due and payable immediately by written notice to the Operating Partnership that payment of the debt securities is due, and to the trustee if given by the holders. 
 
 Subject to provisions in the Indenture relating to its duties in case of default, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of any series of debt securities then outstanding under the Indenture, unless such holders shall have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity. The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or of exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee with respect to that series. However, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction which is in conflict with any law or the Indenture, which may involve the trustee in personal liability or which may be unduly prejudicial to the holders of the debt securities not joining in the proceeding.

The Finance Subsidiary Indenture 
 
 General. All Finance Subsidiary Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Prologis Euro Finance LLC. They are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the OP pursuant to the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, as defined above. The Finance Subsidiary Notes are issuable in registered form in the form set out in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture with coupons in denominations of 100,000 and any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof. None of the Finance Subsidiary Notes are redeemable or convertible at the option of the holders. The Finance Subsidiary Notes do not provide for any sinking fund or analogous provision and are not to be issued upon the exercise of debt warrants. 
 
 Issuance of Additional Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Finance Subsidiary Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture is unlimited. The Finance Subsidiary Notes may be issued in one or more series. The additional series would be established pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or supplemental indentures. 
 
 Trustee. The U.S. Bank National Association is the trustee for all securities issued under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, including the Finance Subsidiary Notes, and is referred to herein as the Trustee. 
 
 Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Security Registrar. The euro-denominated notes define the paying agent as Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch and the transfer agent and security registrar as U.S. Bank National Association. 
 
 Voting Rights. To be entitled to vote at any meeting of the holders of the Finance Subsidiary Notes, a person must be a holder of one or more series of Finance Subsidiary Notes or a person appointed by a holder in writing as a proxy for a holder or holders of one or more such series. At any meeting each holder will be entitled to one vote for each 1,000 principal amount of the Finance Subsidiary Notes. 
 
 Purposes for Which Meetings May Be Called. A meeting of holders may be called at any time to make, give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action. A quorum for a meeting is defined when there is a majority of persons entitled to vote in principal amount of the total Finance Subsidiary Notes. In the absence of a quorum within thirty minutes of the appointed meeting, the meeting will be dissolved or adjourned for a period of 10 days or less. Any resolution presented to a meeting or an adjourned meeting for which a quorum is present may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Finance Subsidiary Notes and may become binding for all holders, whether present, not present or represented at the meeting. 
 
 The Trustee may make reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable at any meetings in regard to proof of the holding of the Finance Subsidiary Notes, the appointment or proxies, the duties of inspectors of the votes, other evidence of the right to vote and other such matters concerning conduct, including the appointment of a temporary chairman. 
 
 Execution of Supplemental Indentures. The Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture for the purpose of adding, changing or eliminating any provisions to the Finance Subsidiary Indenture or related supplemental indentures or to modify the rights of the holders and any related guarantees provided. To do so, the Trustee receives the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Finance Subsidiary Notes affected by the proposed change. 
 
 Redemption Provisions. The euro-denominated notes are redeemable in whole at any time at the option of the OP at a redemption price of equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount Make-Whole Amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the euro-denominated notes to be redeemed discounted to the date of the redemption on an annual basis at the applicable comparable governmental bond rate plus 20 basis points, in the case of the 2027 notes, 15 basis points, in the case of the 2028 notes, 20 or 25 basis points, in the case of either of the 2029 notes, 20 basis points, in the case of the 2031 notes, 25 basis points, in the case of the 2034 notes, 20 basis points, in the case of the 2035 notes, and 30 basis points, in the case of the 2049 notes Redemption Price ). If the euro-denominated notes are redeemed on or after a certain time frame as defined in each note, the price is 100 of the principal amount. 
 
 Payment of Additional Amounts Upon Redemption. All repayments of the Finance Subsidiary Notes will be made by or on behalf of the finance subsidiaries without withholding or deduction for any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, imposed or levied by the U.S. or any taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is 
 
 required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law, the finance subsidiaries will pay to a holder who is not a U.S. person such additional amounts (the Additional Amounts on the Finance Subsidiary Notes as are necessary in order that the net payment by the finance subsidiary or the paying agent of the principal of, and premium Tax Redemption Price ), if any, and interest on, the Finance Subsidiary Notes to such holder, after such withholding or deduction, will not be less than the amount provided in the Finance Subsidiary Notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to certain items as defined in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture. 
 
 Issuance in Euro and Yen. The principal, interest and related Additional Amounts on the Finance Subsidiary Notes (or Make-Whole Amount, Redemption Price or Tax Redemption Price) is payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of Prologis Euro Finance LLC, then all payments in respect of the Finance Subsidiary Notes will be made in U.S. Dollars until the euro is again available to Prologis Euro Finance LLC. The amount payable on any date in euros will be converted to U.S. Dollars on the second business day , which is not weekend day or a day on which banking institutions in the cities of New York, London are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system is open. The rate used would be: 

(1) 
 
 the rate mandated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date; or 

(2) 
 
 the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date if the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not announced a rate of conversion; or 

(3) 
 
 the rate determined at the sole discretion of Prologis Euro Finance LLC on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro, in the event The Wall Street Journal has not published such exchange rate. 

Any payment in respect of the Finance Subsidiary Notes made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default, as defined below, under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture . Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent is responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenomination s. 
 
 Covenants. Under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, the OP must maintain specific covenants to incur additional debt and continue to perform under the Finance Subsidiaries Indenture and not create an Event of Default, including : 

(1) 
 
 all outstanding debt of the OP on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles must be less than 60 of the sum of total assets as of the quarter covered by the Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; 

(2) 
 
 the consolidated income available for debt service, as defined in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, to the annual debt service charge for four consecutive fiscal quarters as of the most recently ended period must be greater than 1.5, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the application of proceeds from the incurrence or refinance of additional debt had it occurred at the beginning of such period; 

(3) 
 
 the total unencumbered assets may not at any time be equal to or less than 150 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the unsecured debt of the OP; 

(4) 
 
 total debt secured by any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind upon any of the property to total assets cannot be equal to or greater than 40 of all outstanding debt of the OP; and 

(5) 
 
 debt will be deemed to be incurred by the OP or subsidiary whenever the OP or subsidiary will create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable. 

Events of Default. As described in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, there are many reasons for events of default, including but not limited to default in payment of principal and any premium when a series of Finance Subsidiary Notes is due and payable at maturity, default in the payment of interest or any Additional Amounts payable, default in performance of any covenant of the Company in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, default of other indebtedness of the Company, the court entering into a final judgment or decree in an aggregate amount, excluding insurance, in excess of 50,000,000 and such charges remaining for 60 days and the court entering into an order or decree of bankruptcy law. 
 
 If an event of default under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, then in every such case, unless the principal of the debt securities of such series shall already have become due and payable, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of such series of debt securities may declare the principal and the make-whole amount on the debt securities of such series to be due and payable immediately by written notice to the Operating Partnership that payment of the debt securities is due, and to the trustee if given by the holders. 
 
 Subject to provisions in the Finance Subsidiary Indenture relating to its duties in case of default, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of any series of debt securities then outstanding under the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, unless such holders shall have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity. The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or of exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee with respect to that series. However, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction which is in 
 
 conflict with any law or the Finance Subsidiary Indenture, which may involve the trustee in personal liability or which may be unduly prejudicial to the holders of the debt securities not joining in the proceeding.

In the event of under-withholding, the Grantee may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or its designated affiliate. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in LTIP Units (or other securities pursuant to paragraph (c)) , for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of vested Award LTIP Units (or other applicable securities) , notwithstanding that a number of the LTIP Units (or other applicable securities) are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.

 We, as management of Duke Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "General Partner"), are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Duke Realty Corporation: 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Realty Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 , and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - real estate and accumulated depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 -3 - 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not preve nt or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedure s may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of certain values assigned to acquired assets and liabilities in certain asset acquisitions 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired approximately 571 million of real estate assets in 2021. For asset acquisitions, the Company records the purchase price to the tangible and identified intangible assets based on its as-if vacant fair value and other valuation techniques. 
 
 We identified the assessment of the fair value of land and the below market component of in-place leases in certain asset acquisitions as a critical audit matter. There is a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in determining the fair value of land and market rents used to determine the below market component of in-place leases. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company s asset allocation process, including controls to identify and select publicly available comparable land sales and market rents used to estimate the fair value of land and the below market component of in-place leases, respectively. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in comparing: 

the Company s estimated fair value of land to a range of independently developed estimates based on publicly available and comparable land sales: and 

the market rents used in the Company s estimated fair value of the below market component of in-place leases to publicly available market data for similar properties.

 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1) The Company 
 
 The General Partner was formed in 1985, and we believe that it qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. The Partnership was formed on October 4, 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. 
 The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning approximately 99.1 of the Common Units at December 31, 2021. The remaining 0.9 of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, the General Partner has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Partnership. The General Partner and the Partnership are operated as one enterprise. The management of the General Partner consists of the same members as the management of the Partnership. As the sole general partner with control of the Partnership, the General Partner consolidates the Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same. 
 Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated a portfolio primarily consisting of industrial properties and provided real estate services to third-party owners, customers and joint ventures. 
 Substantially all of our Rental Operations (see Note 9) are conducted through the Partnership. We conduct our Service Operations (see Note 9) through Duke Realty Services, LLC, Duke Realty Services Limited Partnership and Duke Construction Limited Partnership ("DCLP"), which are consolidated entities that are 100 owned by a combination of the General Partner and the Partnership. DCLP is owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary. 

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. The equity interests in these controlled subsidiaries not owned by us are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that we do not control, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which we are not the primary beneficiary (to the extent applicable), are not consolidated and are reflected as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of reporting. 
 Due to the fact that the Limited Partners do not have kick out rights, or substantive participating rights, the Partnership is a VIE. Because the General Partner holds majority ownership and exercises control over every aspect 
 -18 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 of the Partnership's operations, the General Partner has been de termined as the primary beneficiary of the Partnership and, therefore, consolidates the Partnership. 
 The assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the Partnership are substantially the same, as the General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the Partnership. 
 Reclassifications 
 Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2021 consolidated financial statement presentation. 
 Real Estate Investments 
 Rental real property, including land, land improvements, buildings and tenant improvements, are included in real estate investments and are generally stated at cost. Construction in process and undeveloped land are included in real estate investments and are stated at cost. Real estate investments also include our equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. 
 Depreciation 
 Buildings and land improvements are depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated lives not to exceed 40 and 15 years, respectively, for properties that we develop, and not to exceed 30 and 10 years, respectively, for acquired properties. Tenant improvement costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the related lease. 
 Cost Capitalization 
 Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with the development, construction or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. Direct costs include all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals. We capitalize a portion of our indirect costs associated with our construction and development efforts. Costs that are incremental to executing a lease are capitalized. In assessing the amount of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. We do not capitalize any costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects. 
 We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs during the period when we commence activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use, including land entitlement and preconstruction activities, up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In addition, we capitalize costs, including real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, that have been allocated to vacant space based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy during the extended lease-up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. 
 We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease-up periods when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90 occupancy. 
 Impairment 
 -19 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 We evaluate our real estate assets, with the exception of those that are classified as held-for-sale, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such an evaluation is consider ed necessary, we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset, or asset group, with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of t hat asset, or asset group. Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasin g commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is, therefore, subjective by nature. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material. To the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset, or asset group, exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. 
 The determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective, especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions. We primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets. We utilize marketplace participant assumptions to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is required to be measured. The estimation of future cash flows, as well as the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach, are highly subjective measures in estimating fair value. 
 Real estate assets classified as held-for-sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Once a property is designated as held-for-sale, no further depreciation expense is recorded. 
 Asset Acquisitions 
 Our acquisitions of properties have been accounted for as asset acquisitions as they have not met the definition of a business. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized. To the extent that we gain control of real estate properties that are accounted for as asset acquisitions, as opposed to business combinations, we accumulate the costs of any pre-existing equity interests and consideration paid for additional interest acquired and we do not remeasure our pre-existing equity interest. Generally contingencies arising from an asset acquisition are only recognized when probable. 
 We allocate the purchase price of asset acquisitions to tangible and identified intangible assets based on their relative fair values, using all pertinent information available at the date of acquisition. Capitalized acquisition costs are also included in the total cost basis of acquired properties that are asset acquisitions. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon management's determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow, approach that relies upon internally determined assumptions that we believe are consistent with current market conditions for similar properties. The most important assumptions in determining the allocation of the purchase price to tangible assets are the exit capitalization rate, estimated market rents and the fair value of the underlying land. The purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated to intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. 
 The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) management's estimate of the amounts that would be received using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the 
 -20 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. 
 Factors considered in determining the value allocable to in-place leases include estimates, during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, of space that is actually leased at the time of acquisition, of lost rent at market rates, fixed operating costs that will be recovered from tenants and theoretical leasing commissions required to execute similar leases. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease. 
 Joint Ventures 
 We have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that are primarily engaged in the operation and development of industrial real estate properties. 
 We consolidate joint ventures that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination. 
 To the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE. To the extent that we own interests in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary. Consolidated joint ventures that are VIE's were not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
 To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as VIEs, they are consolidated if we control them through majority ownership interests or if we are the managing entity (general partner or managing member) and our partner does not have substantive participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by our ability to unilaterally make significant operating decisions, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the non-managing entity and the inability of the non-managing entity to remove us from our role as the managing entity. Consolidated joint ventures that are not VIEs are not significant in any period presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
 We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we exercise significant influence but do not have control. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet. 
 When we sell or contribute properties to unconsolidated joint ventures and retain a non-controlling ownership interest in such assets, we recognize the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the asset sold or contributed when its derecognition criteria are met. The equity method investment we retain in such partial sale transactions is noncash consideration and is measured at fair value. As a result, the accounting for a partial sale results in the recognition of a full gain or loss. 
 When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value. 
 -21 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 In July 2021, we entered in to a 20 -owned unconsolidated joint venture with CBRE Global Investors ("CBREGI") with plans to contribute three tranches of properties. We contributed two separate tranches of properties to the joint venture during 2021 (see Note 5) while the third tranch e was closed in January 2022 (see Note 14). The joint venture financed the acquisition of these properties with a combination of third party first mortgage loans and equity contributions from our partner in this joint venture. 
 There were no unconsolidated joint ventures, in which we have any recognized assets or liabilities or have retained any economic exposure to loss at December 31, 2021 that met the criteria to be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2021, we guaranteed the repayment of a loan associated with one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The maximum guarantee exposure for the loan was approximately 4.8 million. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 Investments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. 
 Valuation of Receivables 
 Our determination of the adequacy of our allowances for tenant receivables includes a binary assessment of whether or not the amounts due under a tenant s lease agreement are probable of collection. For such amounts that are deemed probable of collection, revenue continues to be recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For such amounts that are deemed not probable of collection, revenue is recorded as the lesser of (i) the amount which would be recognized on a straight-line basis or (ii) cash that has been received from the tenant, with any tenant and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against rental income in the period of the change in the collectability determination. 
 Deferred Costs 
 Deferred Financing Costs 
 Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are deferred and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loan. The costs for issuing debt, other than lines of credit, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the debt's carrying value, while debt issuance costs related to the Partnership's unsecured line of credit are presented as assets on the consolidated balance sheets, as part of other escrow deposits and other assets. 
 Lease Related Costs and Acquired Lease-Related Intangible Assets 
 Costs that are directly incremental to executing a lease are capitalized. 
 Acquired lease-related intangible assets consist of above market lease assets and the value allocable to in-place leases. Above market lease assets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. In-place lease intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Deferred leasing costs and acquired lease-related intangible assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding amounts classified as held-for-sale, were as follows (in thousands):

Noncontrolling Interests 
 Noncontrolling interests relate to the minority ownership interests in the Partnership and interests in consolidated property partnerships that are not wholly owned by the General Partner or the Partnership. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders' proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity. We report noncontrolling interests as a component of total equity. 
 When a Common Unit of the Partnership is redeemed (Note 1), the change in ownership is treated as an equity transaction by the General Partner and there is no effect on its earnings or net assets. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Rental and Related Revenue 
 Rental income from leases to customers is recognized on a straight-line basis. If a lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether we or the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized as revenue over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, and we fund such improvements, we record such tenant improvement allowances as lease incentives and amortize as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. 
 We record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any material conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us.

 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 General Contractor and Service Fee Revenue 
 General contractor and service fee revenues are comprised primarily of construction and development related revenues earned from third parties while acting in capacity of a developer, as a general contractor or a construction manager. We evaluate the goods and services provided in these construction arrangements to determine whether we are acting as principal or agent and, accordingly, recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based on that evaluation. There are other ancillary streams of revenue included in general contractor and service fee revenues (see Note 9), such as management fees earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in accordance with the terms specific to each arrangement, which are not significant. 
 Our construction arrangements are typically structured with only one performance obligation, which generally represents an obligation either to construct a new building or to construct fixtures in an existing building, and these single performance obligations are satisfied over time as construction progresses. We recognize revenue as we satisfy such performance obligations using the percentage of completion method, which is an input method. Using this method, profits are recorded based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. We believe the percentage of completion method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services as changes in job performance and estimated profitability, which result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined, have not historically been significant. We typically receive regular progress payments on the majority of our construction arrangements and such arrangements generally have an original duration of less than one year. As the result of the relatively short duration of our construction arrangements, we apply the optional disclosure exemptions, related to our remaining performance obligations for our in-process construction projects, for which any future variable consideration is not material. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. To the extent that a fixed-price contract is estimated to result in a loss, the loss is recorded immediately. 
 Opening and closing balances of construction receivables are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under billed and over billed receivables on construction contracts totaled 45.8 million and 1.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 16.6 million and 105,000, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Over billed receivables are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We generally do not have any contract assets associated with our construction arrangements. 
 Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected. Maintenance fees are based upon established hourly rates and are recognized as the services are performed. 
 Property Sales 
 Only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (for example, a disposal of a major geographic area or a major line of business) should be presented as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, without consideration of significant continuing involvement. 
 We recognize gains on sales of properties, including partial sales, of non-financial assets (and in-substance non-financial assets) when the recognition criteria are met. In the typical course of our business, sales of non-financial assets represent only one performance obligation and are recognized when an enforceable contract is in place, collectability is ensured and control is transferred to the buyer. 
 Leases 
 -24 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 As a lessor, our primary business is the development, acquisition, and operation of i ndustrial real estate properties that are held for investment and leased to tenants. We manage residual risk through investing in properties that we believe will appreciate in value over time. We also evaluate the collectability of the cash flows of our le ases prior to their execution, and on an ongoing basis, to ensure collectability is probable prior to recognizing lease revenues on an accrual basis. 
 We only capitalize the incremental costs of signing a lease. Non-incremental costs attributable to successful leases, as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, represent internal costs allocable to successful leasing activities and exclude estimated costs related to downtime and/or unsuccessful deals. These costs primarily consist of compensation and other benefits for internal leasing and legal personnel. These costs are not capitalizable "incremental costs" in the context of the applicable lease accounting rules, but we believe separate presentation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations provides useful information for purposes of comparability with economically similar success-based costs incurred by other organizations that outsource their leasing functions, which are generally capitalizable. 
 We exclude certain lessor costs, such as real estate taxes and insurance, that are paid directly by lessees to third parties, from rental revenue and the associated rental expense. Lessor costs that are paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessee continue to be recorded through rental revenue and the associated rental expense. 
 The applicable lease accounting rules allow a practical expedient for lessors to not separate rental recovery revenue related to lease-related services from the associated rental revenue related to the lease when certain criteria are met. The lease-related services provided to our tenants include property management, common area maintenance ("CAM") and utilities. We assessed the applicable criteria, concluding that the timing and straight-line pattern of transfer to the lessees for rental recovery revenue from our lease-related services and revenue from the underlying leases are the same and that lease classification does not change, and we have consistently applied this practical expedient in all periods presented. 
 As a lessee, we apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset. This classification determines whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In the capacity of a lessee, we record a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of classification. 
 See Note 3 for further disclosure on our leases as a lessor and lessee. 
 Net Income Per Common Share or Common Unit 
 Basic net income per common share or Common Unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders or common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on share-based awards expected to vest (referred to as "participating securities" and primarily composed of unvested restricted stock units), by the weighted average number of common shares or Common Units outstanding for the period. 
 Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the sum of net income attributable to common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in earnings allocable to Limited Partner Units (to the extent the Limited Partner Units are dilutive), less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, to the extent they are dilutive, weighted average number of Limited Partner Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period. Diluted net income per Common Unit is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common unitholders, less dividends or distributions on participating securities that are anti-dilutive, by the sum of the weighted average number of Common Units outstanding and any potential dilutive securities for the period.

Federal Income Taxes 
 General Partner 
 The General Partner has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, as amended. To qualify as a REIT, the General Partner must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain the General Partner's REIT status. As a REIT, the General Partner is entitled to a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. Accordingly, the General Partner generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as it currently distributes to shareholders an amount equal to or in excess of its taxable income. The General Partner is, however, generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its shareholders. If the General Partner fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 
 REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. As a REIT, the General Partner may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if it engages in certain types of transactions.

Partnership 
 For the Partnership, the allocated share of income and loss other than the operations of its taxable REIT subsidiary is included in the income tax returns of its partners; accordingly the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Partnership are in connection with its taxable REIT subsidiary. 
 Income taxes are not material to our operating results or financial position. Our taxable REIT subsidiary has no significant net deferred income tax positions or unrecognized tax benefit items. 
 Cash Paid for Income Taxes 
 We paid federal, state and local income taxes, net of income tax refunds, of 22.2 million and 7.8 million in 2021 and 2019, respectively. We received income tax refunds, net of federal, state and local income tax payments, of 308,000 in 2020. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
 -27 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which we have access. 
 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 
 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. 
 In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 We periodically enter into certain interest rate protection agreements to effectively convert or cap floating rate debt to a fixed rate, and to hedge anticipated future financing transactions, both of which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The entire effect of any hedging instruments and hedged items are presented in the same income statement line item. 
 If a derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(3) Leases 
 Lease Income 
 Our leases generally include scheduled rent increases, but do not include variable payments based on indexes. Our rental revenue is primarily based on fixed, non-cancelable leases. Our variable rental revenue primarily consists of amounts recovered from lessees for property tax, insurance and CAM. 
 All revenues related to lease and lease-related services are included in, and comprise substantially all of, the caption "Rental and Related Revenue" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The components of Rental and Related Revenue are as follows (in thousands):

Lessee Accounting 
 As of December 31, 2021, our lease arrangements, where we are the lessee, primarily consisted of office and ground leases. For these lease arrangements, we recognized ROU assets and the corresponding lease liabilities representing the discounted value of future lease payments required. In determining these amounts, we elected an available practical expedient that allows us, as a lessee, to not separate lease and non-lease components. Expenses recognized on these leases for the year ended December 31, 2021 were not material. 
 
 Our operating leases primarily include all of our office leases and two ground leases. As of December 31, 2021, a 36.8 million ROU asset associated with operating leases was included within Other Escrow Deposits and Other Assets and a corresponding lease liability of 41.4 million was included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, total ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases were 38.9 million and 42.9 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the future lease payments (in thousands) to be made under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements:

 December 31, 2021 was 4.42 . As the d iscount rates implied in our operating lease arrangements were not readily determinable, we utilized our current credit ratings and credit yields observed from market traded securities with similar credit ratings to form a reasonable basis to establish sec ured borrowing rates when determining the present value of future operating lease payments. 
 Our finance leases include two long term ground leases. As of December 31, 2021, a 37.5 million ROU asset associated with finance leases was included within Other Escrow Deposits and Other Assets and a corresponding 39.2 million lease liability was included within Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, total finance lease related ROU assets and liabilities were 19.2 million and 19.4 million, respectively.

The ground lease payment obligation for one ground lease is subject to an annual consumer price index increase limited within a minimum 2 and a maximum 3 increase. T he contractual obligations for both leases included above assume the minimum annual increase for the remainder of the lease term since we cannot predict future adjustments. The weighted average remaining lease term for our finance lease arrangements, on a combined basis as of December 31, 2021 was 54.2 years. The weighted average discount rate for our finance lease arrangements as of December 31, 2021 was 5.12 . The lessors' implicit rates in the leases were readily determinable when the leases were commenced.

 Distribution of Joint Venture Properties 
 As part of a plan of dissolution, we received a non-cash distribution of real estate assets from two 50 -owned unconsolidated joint ventures. These joint ventures distributed their ownership in two in-service properties and certain parcels of undeveloped land to our partner, who shares control with us over both joint ventures, while distributing their ownership interest in an in-service property, a property under construction and a parcel of undeveloped land to us. These distributions were based on values negotiated between us and our partner on an arms-length basis and we determined that these negotiated values represented the fair value of the assets at their highest and best use, as determined from the perspective of a market participant. Concurrent with these asset distributions, both we and our partner assumed and repaid all of the joint ventures' unsecured debt, with each party paying off an amount necessary for the value of the assets distributed, net of debt repayments, to be equal. 
 -31 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 As the result of this dissolution transaction , we recognized a gain of 10.6 million (included in equity in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations), which was related to the properties distributed to our partner. We did not recognize a gain to remeasure our existing ownership interest in the assets we received in distribution and we recognized such assets at a combined basis of 52.2 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (not included in the 2021 Acquisitions table above). We assumed and immediately repaid unsecured debt of the joi nt ventures totaling 40.2 million. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We determine the fair value of the individual components of income producing real estate asset acquisitions primarily through calculating the "as-if vacant" value of a building, using an income approach, which relies significantly upon internally determined assumptions. We have determined that these estimates primarily rely on Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions. The most significant assumptions used in calculating the "as-if vacant" value for acquisition activity during 2021 and 2020, respectively, are as follows: 

2021 

2020 

Low 
 
 High 

Low 
 
 High 

Exit capitalization rate

Annual net rental rate per square foot on acquired buildings

5.28 
 
 18.11 

Annual net rental rate per acre on acquired ground lease 
 
 182,136 
 
 182,136 

The estimate of the portion of the "as-if vacant" value that is allocated to the land underlying the acquired real estate relies on Level 3 inputs and is primarily determined by reference to recent comparable transactions. 
 Capitalized acquisition costs were insignificant and the fair value of net assets acquired from unrelated parties during the year ended December 31, 2021 was substantially the same as the cost of acquisition. 
 Dispositions 
 Dispositions of buildings (see Note 7 for the number of buildings sold in each year) and undeveloped land generated net cash proceeds of 1.07 billion, 336.3 million and 432.7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 On July 22, 2021, we closed on the sale of 14 wholly-owned buildings and 15 acres of undeveloped land, for net cash proceeds of 286.3 million, which completed our previously announced exit from the St. Louis market. This sale did not represent a strategic shift in operations. 
 In addition, in July 2021 we entered into a 20 -owned unconsolidated joint venture with plans to contribute three tranches of properties for a total of nine properties. Pursuant to the terms of the joint venture, on July 27, 2021, we contributed to the joint venture the first tranche of three properties, which consisted of two buildings and one trailer storage lot in Chicago and Atlanta, for net cash proceeds of 115.7 million. On September 21, 2021, we contributed the second tranche of three properties, which consisted of two buildings and one trailer storage lot in Baltimore, to the joint venture for net cash proceeds of 172.9 million. The joint venture financed the acquisition of these properties with a combination of third party first mortgage loans and equity contributions from our partner. we received 41.1 million for our ownership share of proceeds from such third party first mortgage loans, which was included in capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. We closed on the contribution of the third tranche in January 2022 (see Note 14). 
 During 2020, we collected the remaining 110.0 million of principal on our outstanding notes receivable, which was related to the sale of our medical office portfolio during 2017.

(1) Differences between the net investment in our unconsolidated joint ventures and our underlying equity in the net assets of the ventures are primarily a result of basis differences associated with the sales of properties to joint ventures in which we retained an ownership interest. These adjustments have resulted in an aggregate difference increasing our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures by 3.8 million and 2.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Differences between historical cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level (other than loans and impairments) are typically depreciated over the life of the related asset.

 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 The fair value of our fixed rate secured deb t at December 31, 2021 was 60.0 million. Because our fixed rate secured debt is not actively traded in any marketplace, we utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to determine its fair value. Accordingly, we calculated fair value by applying an esti mate of the current market rate to discount the debt's remaining contractual cash flows. Our estimate of a current market rate, which is the most significant input in the discounted cash flow calculation, is intended to replicate debt of similar maturity and loan-to-value relationship. The estimated market rates for all of our current fixed rate secured debt are between 2.40 and 2.90 , depending on the attributes of the specific loans. The current market rates we utilized were internally estimated; there fore, we have concluded that our determination of fair value for our fixed rate secured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs. 
 In February 2020, a consolidated joint venture obtained an 18.4 million secured loan from a third party financial institution, with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.41 and a maturity date of March 1, 2035. 
 In September 2020, we assumed two secured loans in conjunction with a two-building asset acquisition. These assumed loans had a total face value of 21.5 million and fair value of 25.5 million. These assumed loans had a weighted average remaining term at acquisition of 11.8 years and carried a weighted average stated interest rate of 4.54 . The difference between the fair value and the face value of loans assumed in connection with the acquisition is recorded as a premium and amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans assumed. We used an estimated market interest rate of 2.50 in determining the fair values of these loans. 
 During 2020, we repaid one fixed rate secured loan, totaling 9.0 million, which had a stated interest rate of 5.61 . 
 Unsecured Debt 
 At December 31, 2021, all of our unsecured debt bore interest at fixed rates and primarily consisted of unsecured notes that are publicly traded. We utilized broker estimates in estimating the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt. The broker estimates took into account any recent trades within the same series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, comparisons to recent trades of other series of our fixed rate unsecured debt, trades of fixed rate unsecured debt from companies with profiles similar to ours, as well as overall economic conditions. We reviewed these broker estimates for reasonableness and accuracy, considering whether the estimates were based upon market participant assumptions within the principal and most advantageous market and whether any other observable inputs would be more accurate indicators of fair value than the broker estimates. We concluded that the broker estimates were representative of fair value. We have determined that our estimation of the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured debt was primarily based upon Level 3 inputs. The estimated trading values of our fixed rate unsecured debt, depending on the maturity and coupon rates, ranged from 95.00 to 125.00 of face value. 
 The indentures (and related supplemental indentures) governing our outstanding series of unsecured notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants at December 31, 2021. 
 We took the following actions during 2021 and 2020 as they pertain to our unsecured indebtedness: 

In November 2021, the Partnership issued 500.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear a stated interest rate of 2.25 , have an effective interest rate of 2.38 and mature on January 15, 2032. Proceeds from this unsecured notes offering will be allocated to finance or refinance eligible green projects. 

In August 2021, we redeemed 250.0 million of 3.63 senior unsecured notes due April 2023. We recognized a loss of 13.9 million in connection with the redemption of these notes including the prepayment premium and write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 

In June 2021, we redeemed 83.7 million of 3.88 senior unsecured notes due October 2022. In connection with the early repayment of these notes, we recognized a loss of 3.9 million, including the prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In January 2021, the Partnership issued 450.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear a stated interest rate of 1.75 , ha ve an effective interest rate of 1.83 , and mature on February 1, 2031. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were allocated to finance or refinance eligible green projects. In addition, in January 2021, the Partnership assumed and immediately repaid 40.2 million of unsecured debt related to the assets received as part of the dissolution of unconsolidated joint ventures (see Note 5). 

In June 2020, we issued 350.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a stated interest rate of 1.75 , have an effective interest rate of 1.85 and mature on July 1, 2030. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repurchase and cancel 216.3 million of 3.88 senior unsecured notes due 2022 pursuant to a tender offer completed by the Partnership in June 2020. In connection with the early cancellation of these notes, we recognized a loss of 15.1 million consisting of a repayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 

In February 2020, we issued 325.0 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a stated interest rate of 3.05 , have an effective interest rate of 3.19 , and mature on March 1, 2050. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were primarily used to repay the 300.0 million of senior unsecured notes bearing a stated interest rate of 4.38 due 2022. In connection with the early redemption of these notes, we recognized a loss of 17.8 million consisting of a prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Unsecured Line of Credit Partnership

March 31, 2025 

In March 2021, the Partnership amended and restated its existing 1.20 billion unsecured line of credit, which was set to mature in January 2022 with with options to extend until January 30, 2023. The amended and restated line of credit bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.775 with a reduction in borrowing costs if certain sustainability linked metrics are achieved each year. In addition, the amended and restated line of credit matures on March 31, 2025 with options to extend until March 31, 2026. Subject to certain conditions, the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional 800.0 million, for a total of up to 2.00 billion. This line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions. The line of credit also allows automatic transition to an alternative rate of interest in the event that the one-month LIBOR ceases to publish and needs to be replaced. As a result of amending and restating the unsecured line of credit, we incurred 6.2 million of deferred financing costs through December 31, 2021. 
 This line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to fixed charge coverage, unsecured interest expense coverage and debt-to-asset value (with asset value being defined in the Partnership's unsecured line of credit agreement). At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under this line of credit. 
 We utilized a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value of outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. T o the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination of the line of credit, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. This estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. As our credit spreads have not 
 -37 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 changed appreciably, we believe that the contractual interest rate and the current market rate on any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit are the same. The current market rate is internally estimated and therefore is primarily based upon a Level 3 input.

(9) Segment Reporting 
 Reportable Segments 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had two reportable operating segments, the first consisting of the ownership and rental of industrial real estate investments. We continue to increase our investments in quality industrial properties largely based on anticipated geographic trends in supply and demand for industrial buildings, as well as the real estate needs of our major tenants that operate on a national level. We treat our industrial properties as a single operating and reportable segment based on our method of internal reporting. Properties not included in this reportable segment, because they are not industrial properties and do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as non-reportable Rental Operations. Our non-reportable Rental Operations primarily include our remaining office properties and medical 
 -38 - 
 
 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 office property at December 31, 2021. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations, are co llectively referred to as "Rental Operations." 
 Our second reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as development, general contracting, construction management, property management, asset management, maintenance and leasing to third-party property customers, owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." The Service Operations segment is identified as one single operating segment because the lowest level of financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are the results for the Service Operations segment in total. Further, our reportable segments are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise . 
 Revenues by Reportable Segment

 Supplemental Performance Measure 
 PNOI is the non-GAAP supplemental performance measure that we use to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources among, the real estate investments in the reportable and operating segments that comprise our Rental Operations. PNOI for our Rental Operations segments is comprised of rental revenues from continuing operations less rental expenses and real estate taxes from continuing operations, along with certain other adjusting items (collectively referred to as "Rental Operations revenues and expenses excluded from PNOI," as shown in the following table). Additionally, we do not allocate interest expense, depreciation expense and certain other non-property specific revenues and expenses (collectively referred to as "Non-Segment Items," as shown in the following table) to our individual operating segments.

The most comparable GAAP measure to PNOI is income from continuing operations before income taxes. PNOI excludes expenses that materially impact our overall results of operations and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for income from continuing operations before income taxes or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, PNOI may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In addition to revenues and PNOI, we also review our second generation capital expenditures in measuring the performance of our individual Rental Operations segments. We review these expenditures to determine the costs associated with re-leasing vacant space and maintaining the condition of our properties. Our second generation capital expenditures are included within "second generation tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements" in our consolidated statements of Cash Flows and are primarily attributable to the industrial segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 

(10) Employee Benefit Plans 
 We maintain a 401(k) plan for our eligible employees. We make matching contributions of 50 of the employee salary deferral contributions up to 6 of eligible compensation and may also make annual discretionary contributions. A discretionary contribution was declared at the end of 2021, 2020 and 2019. The total expense recognized for this plan was 2.6 million, 2.2 million and 2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Effective January 1, 2022, we have increased the matching contribution of 50 of employee salary deferral contributions to up to 10 of employees' eligible compensation. 

(11) Shareholders' Equity of the General Partner and Partners' Capital of the Partnership 
 General Partner 
 The General Partner has an at the market ("ATM") equity program that allows it to issue and sell its common shares through sales agents from time to time. Actual sales under the ATM equity program depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the General Partner, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the General Partner s common stock, determinations by the General Partner of the appropriate sources of funding and potential uses of funding available. 
 In February 2021, the General Partner terminated its previous equity distribution agreement for the ATM equity program and entered into a new equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the General Partner may sell from time to time up to an aggregate offering price of 400.0 million of its common stock through sales agents or forward sellers. No forward sales were executed in 2021 and substantially all of the capacity of this ATM program was utilized as of December 31, 2021. 
 During 2021, the General Partner issued 8.2 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs, generating gross proceeds of 408.3 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of 403.6 million. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities. 
 During 2020, the General Partner issued 4.6 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity programs, generating gross proceeds of 177.1 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of 175.0 million. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities. 
 During 2019, the General Partner issued 8.0 million common shares pursuant to its ATM equity program, generating gross proceeds of approximately 266.3 million and, after deducting commissions and other costs, net proceeds of approximately 263.3 million. The proceeds from these offerings were contributed to the Partnership and used to fund development activities. 
 Partnership

 DUKE REALTY CORPORATION AND DUKE REALTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 For each common share or preferred share that the General Partner issues, the Partnership issues a corresponding General Partner Unit or Preferred Unit, as applicable, to the General Partner in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. Similarly, when the General Partner redeems or repurchases common shares or preferred shares, the Partnership redeems the corresponding General Partner Units or Preferred Units held by the General Partner at the same price. 

(12) Stock Based Compensation 
 We are authorized to issue up to 9.7 million shares of the General Partner's common stock under our stock-based employee and non-employee compensation plans. Executive officers may elect to receive Long-Term Incentive Plan Units ("LTIP Units"), which represent an interest in the Partnership, in lieu of stock based compensation awards denominated in the General Partner's common stock. 
 Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") 
 Under our 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by the General Partner's shareholders in April 2015, and our 2015 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Compensation Plans"), RSUs may be granted to non-employee directors, executive officers and selected employees. An RSU is economically equivalent to a share of the General Partner's common stock, and RSUs are valued based on the market price of the General Partner's common stock on the date of the award. Amounts disclosed below include both RSUs and any elected LTIP Units, which have the same vesting schedule as RSUs. 
 RSUs granted to employees from 2015 to 2021 vest ratably in most cases over a three-year period and are payable in shares of our common stock with a new share of such common stock issued upon each RSU's vesting. RSUs granted to existing non-employee directors vest 100 over one year and have contractual lives of one year. 
 To the extent that a recipient of an RSU grant is not determined to be retirement eligible, as defined by the Compensation Plans, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Expense is recognized immediately at the date of grant to the extent a recipient is retirement eligible and expense is accelerated to the extent that a participant will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the contractual life of granted RSUs. 
 The following table summarizes transactions for our unvested RSUs, excluding dividend equivalents, for 2021:

 As of December 31, 2021, there was 6.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs granted under the Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. 
 The total intrinsic value (which is equal to the value of a share of the General Partner's common stock on the date of vesting) of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 11.7 million, 15.4 million and 17.7 million, respectively.

 The weighted average grant-date fair value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2019 was 27.73. 
 Performance-Based Awards 
 A portion of the annual stock-based compensation awards granted to our executive officers annually include performance conditions, measured over a three-year performance period, based on pre-established goals for growth in a defined adjusted funds from operations AFFO metric. These performance-based awards disclosed below include awards denominated in both common shares of the General Partner or LTIP Units. The total number of instruments issued at the end of each performance period may be earned in a range from 0 to 200 of the target value of the award depending on our AFFO performance relative to the pre-established goals. 
 To the extent that a recipient of these performance-based awards is not determined to be retirement eligible, as defined by the Compensation Plans, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the performance period based on the most likely payout percentage at each reporting period for each grant to the extent that a payout is determined to be probable. Expense is recognized immediately at the date of grant, based on the most likely payout percentage to the extent that a payout is determined to be probable, when a recipient is retirement eligible, and expense is accelerated to the extent that a participant will become retirement eligible prior to the end of the performance period of an award.

(13) Commitments and Contingencies 
 Legal 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. 
 Environmental 
 We generally perform environmental site assessments at properties we are considering acquiring. The properties, particularly land parcels, we acquire may have been subject to adverse environmental conditions as a result of previous owners operations, which require remediation prior to development of land by the applicable environmental laws or regulations. 
 At the time of acquisition, we establish a liability for the costs associated with environmental remediation when such obligation has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Subsequently we adjust the liability as appropriate when additional information becomes available. We record such environmental liabilities in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities 
 The Partnership has guaranteed the repayment of 18.5 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We may be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees. 
 The Partnership also has guaranteed the repayment of a loan associated with one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. At December 31, 2021, the maximum guarantee exposure for the loan was approximately 4.8 million.

 In January 2022, we contributed three buildings to an unconsolidated joint venture. The joint venture financed the acquisition of these properties with a combination of third party first mortgage loans and equity contributions from our partner and we received approximately 289.7 million of net cash proceeds, including our share of the proceeds from the joint venture's first mortgage loans. 

Debt Extinguishment 
 On January 14, 2022, we provided notice of redemption to the holders of our 300.0 million of 3.75 unsecured notes, which are scheduled to mature in December 2024. This redemption occurred on February 13, 2022 and resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 22.0 million , which is comprised of the prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

 The tax basis (in thousands) of our real estate assets at December 31, 2021 was approximately 8,734,029 (unaudited) for federal income tax purposes. 

(2) 
 
 Depreciation of real estate is computed using the straight-line method not to exceed 40 years for buildings and 15 years for land improvements for properties that we develop, and not to exceed 30 years for buildings and 10 years for land improvements for properties that we acquire. Tenant improvements are depreciated over shorter periods based on lease terms (generally 3 to 10 years).
