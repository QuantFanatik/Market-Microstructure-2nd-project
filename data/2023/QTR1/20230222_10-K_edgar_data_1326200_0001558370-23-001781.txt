 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General We are a New York City-based company incorporated in the Marshall Islands in 2004. We transport iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. Our fleet currently consists of 44 drybulk carriers, including 17 Capesize drybulk carriers, 15 Ultramax drybulk carriers, and twelve Supramax drybulk carriers with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,636,000 deadweight tons dwt ). The average age of our current fleet is approximately 11.0 years. All of the vessels in our fleet were built in shipyards with reputations for constructing high-quality vessels. We seek to deploy our vessels on time charters, spot market voyage charters, spot market-related time charters or in vessel pools trading in the spot market, to reputable charterers. Of the vessels in our fleet, 18 are currently on spot market voyage charters, 20 are on fixed-rate time charter contracts, four are on spot market-related time charters, and we are currently time chartering-in three third party vessels. See pages 5 6 for a table of our current fleet. Genco s approach towards fleet composition is to own a high-quality fleet of vessels that focuses on Capesize, Ultramax and Supramax vessels. Capesize vessels represent our major bulk vessel category and the other vessel classes, including Ultramax and Supramax vessels, represent our minor bulk vessel category. Our major bulk vessels are primarily used to transport iron ore and coal, while our minor bulk vessels are primarily used to transport grains, steel products and other drybulk cargoes such as cement, scrap, fertilizer, bauxite, nickel ore, salt and sugar. This approach of owning ships that transport both major and minor bulk commodities provide us with exposure to a wide range of drybulk trade flows. We employ an active commercial strategy which consists of a global team located in the U.S., Copenhagen and Singapore. Overall, we utilize a portfolio approach to revenue generation through a combination of short-term, spot market employment, index-linked time charters as well as opportunistically booking longer term fixed-rate coverage. Our fleet deployment strategy currently is weighted towards short-term fixtures, which provides us with optionality on our sizeable fleet. However, depending on market conditions, we may seek to enter into additional longer term time charter contracts or contracts of affreightment. In addition to both short and long-term time charters, we fix our vessels on spot market voyage charters as well as spot market-related time charters depending on market conditions and management s outlook. Furthermore, we have also transported containers on select vessels on an opportunistic basis. We will continue to explore the possibility of transporting containers on board select vessels from time to time, which could provide additional flexibility for vessel fixture options, primarily for backhaul trades. Drawing on one of the strongest balance sheets in the drybulk industry, in April 2021 we announced a new comprehensive value strategy. This strategy is centered on three key pillars: compelling dividends, financial deleveraging and growth. During 2021, we executed this strategy by paying down 203 million of debt while expanding our core Ultramax fleet. Additionally, during 2022, we paid down an additional 75 million of debt, bringing our debt outstanding to 171 million, a 62 reduction from January 1, 2021. These actions have enabled us to further reduce our cash flow breakeven rate positioning us to pay sizeable quarterly dividends across diverse market environments. To support this strategy, in August 2021, we closed on a new 450 Million Credit Facility which we used to refinance our prior credit facilities, thereby increasing flexibility, improving key terms and lowering our cash flow breakeven rates. Within this facility is a significant revolving credit facility that we can utilize, of which 212.9 million is undrawn as of December 31, 2022. The first quarterly dividend under Genco s value strategy was paid during the first quarter of 2022 based on the financial results from the fourth quarter of 2021. Since the fourth quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022, we have declared cumulative dividends under our value strategy of 3.24 per share. In line with our value strategy, we will continue to focus on the following specific priorities for 2023: Pay attractive dividends to shareholders

 Continue to pay down debt through voluntary prepayments from a combination of cash flow generation and cash on our balance sheet; and Opportunistically grow the fleet on a low levered basis Our Operations We report financial information and evaluate our operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for our customers, i.e., spot or time charters. Each of our vessels serves the same type of customer, has similar operations and maintenance requirements, operates in the same regulatory environment, and is subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment in which we are engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, spot market voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. In September 2021, we entered into a joint venture named GS Shipmanagement Pte. Ltd GSSM with Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd. Synergy ), one of our previous technical managers. GSSM currently provides the technical management to all 44 vessels in our fleet. GSSM aims to provide a unique and differentiated service to the management of our vessels. We expect this joint venture to increase visibility and control over our vessel operations, augment fleet-wide fuel efficiency to lower our carbon footprint through an advanced data platform and potentially provide vessel operating expense savings over time. Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of GSSM. AVAILABLE INFORMATION We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.gencoshipping.com.

To accomplish this objective, we intend to:

 Continue to operate a high-quality fleet We intend to maintain a modern, high-quality fleet that meets or exceeds stringent industry standards and complies with charterer requirements through GSSM s rigorous and comprehensive maintenance program. In addition, GSSM maintains the quality of our vessels by carrying out regular inspections, both while in port and at sea. Utilize an active commercial strategy Our current fleet of 44 drybulk vessels concentrates on the transportation of major and minor bulk commodities globally. In 2017, the Company made a strategic decision to augment its existing in-house commercial operating platform, shifting from a tonnage provider model to an active commercial approach in order to improve margins and grow our network of customers. We expanded our presence globally with the establishment of offices in Singapore and Copenhagen in addition to our corporate headquarters in New York. As a result of this strategic shift, we have been fixing an increasing number of vessels on spot market voyage charters, where we provide a vessel for the transportation of goods between a load port and discharge port at a specified per-ton rate or on a lump sum basis, as well as on contracts of affreightment directly with cargo providers. We believe that our active platform provides added flexibility to changing market conditions and improves operational efficiencies within our owned fleet. Furthermore, we also assess arbitrage opportunities on cargoes through utilizing vessel positions by time chartering-in third party vessels and/or reletting cargo commitments on a voyage basis. In addition to these options, we continue to fix our vessels on both short and long-term time charters, as well as spot market-related time charters, depending on market conditions and outlook. Overall, our fleet deployment strategy is currently weighted towards short-term fixtures, which provide optionality for the Company. We have also selectively booked one to two year period time charters to secure longer term revenue streams at attractive rates while also de-risking select asset purchases. We continuously monitor the drybulk market and may in the future pursue other market opportunities for our vessels to capitalize on market conditions, including arranging more longer term charters and entering into vessel pools. Strategically expand the size of our fleet We may acquire additional modern, high-quality, fuel-efficient drybulk vessels through timely and selective acquisitions in a manner that is accretive to our cash flows and dividend while maintaining low to moderate financial leverage. If we make such acquisitions, we may consider additional debt or equity financing alternatives. Maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations In September 2021, we formed the GSSM joint venture, which is owned 50 by Genco and 50 by Synergy, to provide ship management services for our existing fleet. By April 2022, we completed the transition of our fleet s technical management to GSSM. Currently, all 44 vessels in our fleet are managed by GSSM. We previously outsourced technical management of our fleet to Wallem Shipmanagement Limited Wallem ), Anglo-Eastern Group Anglo and Synergy, all third party independent technical managers. Our management team actively monitors and controls vessel operating expenses incurred by GSSM by overseeing their activities. We also seek to maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations by capitalizing on the cost savings and economies of scale that result from operating a larger fleet as well as sister ships. Sister ships are ships of the same class that are of virtually identical design and are of similar size. Capitalize on our management team s reputation We seek to capitalize on our management team s reputation for high standards of performance, reliability and safety, and maintain strong relationships with major international charterers and cargo providers, many of whom consider the reputation of a vessel owner and operator when entering into time charters. We believe that our management team s track record improves our relationships with high quality shipyards and vendors, as well as financial institutions, many of which consider reputation to be an indicator of creditworthiness.

Commercial management involves negotiating charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, spot market voyage charters, vessel pools and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management involves locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of GSSM. The head of our technical management team has over 30 years of experience in the shipping industry. Under our technical management agreement with GSSM, GSSM is obligated to: provide personnel to supervise the maintenance and general efficiency of our vessels; arrange and supervise the maintenance of our vessels to our standards to assure that our vessels comply with applicable national and international regulations and the requirements of our vessels classification societies; select and train the crews for our vessels, including assuring that the crews have the correct certificates for the types of vessels on which they serve; check the compliance of the crews licenses with the regulations of the vessels flag states and the International Maritime Organization, or IMO; arrange the supply of spares and stores for our vessels; and report expense transactions to us, and make its procurement and accounting systems available to us. OUR CHARTERS As of February 21, 2023, we employed 18 of our vessels on spot market voyage charters where we provide a vessel for the transportation of goods between a load port and discharge port at a specified per-ton or on a lump sum

 basis. Under spot market voyage charters, voyage expenses such as fuel and port charges, are borne by us. Additionally, as of February 21, 2023, we employed 20 of our vessels under fixed-rate time charters and four of our vessels under spot market-related time charters. A time charter involves the hiring of a vessel from its owner for a period of time pursuant to a contract under which the vessel owner places its ship (including its crew and equipment) at the disposal of the charterer. Under a time charter, the charterer periodically pays a fixed daily charterhire rate to the owner of the vessel and bears all voyage expenses, including the cost of bunkers (fuel), port expenses, agents fees and canal dues. Additionally, as of February 21, 2023, we were chartering in three third party vessels that have been employed on spot market voyage charters. Our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by our insurance terms. The technical operation and navigation of the vessel at all times remains the responsibility of the vessel owner, which is generally responsible for the vessel s operating expenses, including the cost of crewing, insuring, repairing and maintaining the vessel, costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. For the vessels that we employ on time charters or spot market-related time charters, agreements expire within a range of dates (for example, a minimum of 4 months and maximum of 6 months following delivery), with the exact end of the time charter left unspecified to account for the uncertainty of when a vessel will complete its final voyage under the time charter. The charterer may extend the charter period by any time that the vessel is off-hire. If a vessel remains off-hire for more than 30 consecutive days, the time charter may be cancelled at the charterer s option. In connection with the charter of each of our vessels, we incur commissions generally ranging from 1.25 to 6.25 of the total daily charterhire rate of each charter or total freight revenue to third parties, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter. We monitor developments in the drybulk shipping industry on a regular basis and strategically adjust the time and duration of employment for our vessels according to market conditions as they become available for hire. The following table sets forth information about the current employment of the vessels in our fleet as of February 21, 2023:

 (1) The charter expiration dates presented represent the earliest dates that our charters may be terminated in the ordinary course. Under the terms of certain contracts, the charterer is entitled to extend the time charter from two to four months in order to complete the vessel s final voyage plus any time the vessel has been off-hire. (2) Time charter rates presented are the gross daily charterhire rates before third party brokerage commission generally ranging from 1.25 to 6.25 . In a time charter, the charterer is responsible for voyage expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents fees and canal dues. CLASSIFICATION AND INSPECTION All of our vessels have been certified as being in class by the American Bureau of Shipping ABS ), DNVGL or Lloyd s Register of Shipping Lloyd s ). Each of these classification societies is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. Every commercial vessel s hull and machinery is evaluated by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. Each vessel is inspected by a surveyor of the classification society in three surveys of varying frequency and thoroughness: every year for the annual survey, every two to three years for the intermediate survey and every four to five years for special surveys. Special surveys always require drydocking. Vessels that are 15 years old or older are required, as part of the intermediate survey process, to be drydocked every 24 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater portions of the vessel and for necessary repairs stemming from the inspection. In addition to the classification inspections, many of our customers regularly inspect our vessels as a precondition to chartering them for voyages. We believe that our well-maintained, high-quality vessels provide us with a competitive advantage in the current environment of increasing regulation and customer emphasis on quality. We have implemented the International Safety Management Code, which was promulgated by the International Maritime Organization, or IMO (the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of marine pollution by ships), to establish pollution prevention requirements applicable to vessels. We obtained documents of compliance and safety management certificates for all of our vessels, which are required by the IMO.

 CREWING AND EMPLOYEES Each of our vessels is crewed with 21 to 23 officers and seamen. We do not provide any seaborne personnel to crew our vessels. Instead, GSSM is responsible for locating and retaining qualified officers for our vessels. The crewing agencies are responsible for each seaman s training, travel and payroll and ensuring that all the seamen on our vessels have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions. Our vessels are typically manned with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties. We currently employ 36 shore-based personnel, which includes personnel in our Singapore and Copenhagen offices. In addition, approximately 970 seagoing personnel are employed on our vessels. Lastly, GSSM currently employs approximately 80 personnel. CUSTOMERS Our assessment of a charterer s financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels. We generally charter our vessels to major trading houses (including commodities traders), major producers and government-owned entities rather than to more speculative or undercapitalized entities. Our customers include national, regional and international companies, such as Rio Tinto Shipping (Asia) Pte. Ltd., Cargill International S.A., BHP, Bunge SA, ADMIntermare, a division of ADM International Sarl, and Vale International S.A. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10 of our voyage revenue. COMPETITION Our business fluctuates in line with the main patterns of trade of the major drybulk cargoes and varies according to changes in the supply and demand for these items. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location and size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. We compete with other owners of drybulk carriers in the Capesize, Panamax, Ultramax, Supramax and Handysize class sectors, some of whom may also charter our vessels as customers. Ownership of drybulk carriers is highly fragmented and is divided among approximately 2,400 independent drybulk carrier owners. PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations required for each vessel depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel s crew and the age of the vessel. We believe that we have all material permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business. INSURANCE General The operation of any drybulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, piracy, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. The United States U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the U.S.-exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the U.S. market.

 While we maintain hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover, and freight, demurrage and defense cover for our fleet and loss of hire insurance for our major bulk vessels in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations, we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel s useful life. Furthermore, while we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Additionally, an increase in cost, or unavailability, of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Hull and Machinery, War Risks, Kidnap and Ransom Insurance We maintain marine hull and machinery, war risks and kidnap and ransom insurance, which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss for all of our vessels. Our vessels are each covered up to at least fair market value with deductibles, which depend primarily on the class of the insured vessel and are subject to change. We are covered, subject to limitations in our policy, to have the crew released in the case of kidnapping due to piracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Guinea. Protection and Indemnity Insurance Protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P I Associations, which insure our third party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal. Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, extended by protection and indemnity mutual associations, or clubs. Subject to the capping discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited. We maintain protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution of 1 billion per vessel per incident. The 13 P I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90 of the world s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association s liabilities. The International Group s website states that the pool provides a mechanism for sharing all claims in excess of 10 million up to, currently, approximately 8.9 billion. We are a member of P I Associations, which are members of the International Group. As a result, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P I Associations comprising the International Group. Loss of Hire Insurance We maintain loss of hire insurance for our major bulk vessels, which covers business interruptions and related losses that result from the loss of use of a vessel. Our loss of hire insurance has a 14-day deductible and provides claim coverage for up to 60 days. ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS Government regulation and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications, procurement of specialized fuels and implementation of certain operating procedures. A variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (applicable national authorities such as the United States Coast Guard USCG ), harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our vessels. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States and international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict our ability to comply and the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability. As one of the largest drybulk shipping companies in the world, we recognize the need to operate a safe, responsible and sustainable business built for the long term. We regularly integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices into our operational and strategic decision making. As such, we aim to meet and, if possible and appropriate for our business, exceed minimum compliance levels set forth in rules and regulations governing the maritime industry, including certain rules and regulations described below. Over the last several years, we have taken various steps to reduce our carbon footprint and improve the environment, including through investments made to our fleet. Specifically, we have: 
 Purchased modern, fuel-efficient vessels with lower overall fuel consumption than older vessels in order to reduce our fleet s greenhouse gas emissions; Divested certain older, less fuel-efficient vessels; Outfitted 31 of our vessels with Energy Saving Devices (ESDs) to reduce the fuel consumptions of these vessels, which may include Mewis Ducts, Fins, Propellers, Propeller Boss Cap Fins and LED lamps; Installed performance-monitoring systems on board 31 of our vessels to gather real-time fuel consumption data to optimize the voyage efficiency of these vessels and are in the process of installing such systems on our remaining vessels; Utilized a third-party data collection platform that analyzes information from our vessels in an effort to reduce fuel consumption, CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions; Established and executed a compliance program regarding IMO 2020 fuel regulations (as described below); Installed ballast water treatment systems on 43 vessels in our current fleet, with installation of such a system on the remaining vessel planned during 2023; Partnered with a third-party firm to conduct internal audits of our vessels with a goal of identifying areas of potential improvement on the daily maintenance and operation of our vessels in order to improve the quality of the services our vessels provide and to mitigate operational risks; Installed Engine Power Limitation (EPL) systems on certain major bulk vessels to increase the level of energy efficiency by optimizing maintenance of the ship s engine power level ; and Implemented an IMO 2023 compliance plan for select vessels within our fleet in which we have installed ESDs and applied high performance paint systems, among other initiatives 
 International Maritime Organization (IMO) The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the IMO ), has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as MARPOL, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 SOLAS Convention ), and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (the LL Convention ). MARPOL establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 and the handling of harmful substances in packaged forms. MARPOL is applicable to drybulk, tanker and LNG carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997; new emissions standards, titled IMO-2020, took effect on January 1, 2020. In 2013, the IMO s Marine Environmental Protection Committee, or the MEPC, adopted a resolution amending MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment Scheme, or CAS. These amendments became effective on October 1, 2014 and require compliance with the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, or ESP Code, which provides for enhanced inspection programs. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments, which could be significant. Air Emissions In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile compounds from cargo tanks, and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below. Emissions of volatile organic compounds from certain vessels, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited. We believe that all our vessels are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations. The MEPC adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5 m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit (reduced from 3.50 starting from January 1, 2020. This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning systems. Ships are now required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention IAPP Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. Additionally, at MEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5 sulfur on ships were adopted and took effect March 1, 2020, with the exception of vessels fitted with exhaust gas cleaning equipment scrubbers which can carry fuel of higher sulfur content. These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls, and may cause us to incur substantial costs, including those related to the purchase, installation and operation of scrubbers and the purchase of compliant fuel oil. Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain Emission Control Areas, or ECAs ). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1 m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified portions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emission controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. Certain ports in which our vessels call, including China and Singapore, are currently or may become subject to local regulations that impose stricter emission controls. In December 2021, the member states of the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution (the Barcelona Convention agreed to support the designation of a new ECA in the Mediterranean. On December 15, 2022, MEPC 79 adopted the designation of a new ECA in the Mediterranean, with an effective date of May 1, 2025. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO, or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations. Refer to Capital Expenditures in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental and operational safety laws that could

Table of Contents 
 require significant expenditures or subject us to increased liability in Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details of our plan for compliance and potential costs. Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC meeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) standards in ECAs will go into effect. Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx produced by vessels with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in 2010 and we are compliant with the Tier I and Tier II requirements for NOx emissions under the EPA standards and Annex VI. We do not currently own any vessels subject to the Tier III requirements, although we may acquire such vessels in the future. As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs. As determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI became effective as of March 1, 2018 and requires ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection having commenced on January 1, 2019. The IMO intends to use such data as the first step in its roadmap (through 2023) for developing its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, as discussed further below. As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans SEEMP ), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index EEDI ). Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30 more energy efficient than those built in 2014. MEPC 75 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI which brings forward the effective date of the EEDI s phase 3 requirements from January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2022 for several ship types, including gas carriers, general cargo ships, and LNG carriers. Additionally, MEPC 75 introduced draft amendments to Annex VI which impose new regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. These amendments introduce requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. The requirements include (1) a technical requirement to reduce carbon intensity based on a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI ), and (2) operational carbon intensity reduction requirements, based on a new operational carbon intensity indicator CII ). The attained EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and above, in accordance with different values set for ship types and categories. With respect to the CII, the draft amendments would require ships of 5,000 gross tonnage to document and verify their actual annual operational CII achieved against a determined required annual operational CII. Additionally, MEPC 75 proposed draft amendments requiring that, on or before January 1, 2023, all ships above 400 gross tonnage must have an approved SEEMP on board. For ships above 5,000 gross tonnage, the SEEMP would need to include certain mandatory content. MEPC 75 also approved draft amendments to MARPOL Annex I to prohibit the use and carriage for use as fuel of heavy fuel oil HFO by ships in Arctic waters on and after July 1, 2024. The draft amendments introduced at MEPC 75 were adopted at the MEPC 76 session in June 2021 and entered into force in November 2022, with the requirements for EEXI and CII certification coming into effect from January 1, 2023. MEPC 77 adopted a non-binding resolution which urges Member States and ship operators to voluntarily use distillate or other cleaner alternative fuels or methods of propulsion that are safe for ships and could contribute to the reduction of Black Carbon emissions from ships when operating in or near the Arctic. MEPC 79 adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, Appendix IX to include the attained and required CII values, the CII rating and attained EEXI for existing ships in the required information to be submitted to the IMO Ship Fuel Oil Consumption Database. The amendments will enter into force on May 1, 2024. We may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Genco plans to continue to invest in its

 existing fleet to improve fuel efficiency and comply with these revised standards through its comprehensive IMO 2023 plan. Safety Management System Requirements The SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills. The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the LLMC sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that our vessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LLMC standards. Under Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the ISM Code ), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical management team have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. GSSM has valid documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO. The document of compliance and safety management certificate are renewed as required. Regulation II-1/3-10 of the SOLAS Convention governs ship construction and stipulates that ships over 150 meters in length must have adequate strength, integrity and stability to minimize risk of loss or pollution. Goal-based standards amendments in SOLAS regulation II-1/3-10 entered into force in 2012, with July 1, 2016 set for application to new oil tankers and bulk carriers. The SOLAS Convention regulation II-1/3-10 on goal-based ship construction standards for bulk carriers and oil tankers, which entered into force on January 1, 2012, requires that all oil tankers and bulk carriers of 150 meters in length and above, for which the building contract is placed on or after July 1, 2016, satisfy applicable structural requirements conforming to the functional requirements of the International Goal-based Ship Construction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers GBS Standards ). Amendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code IMDG Code ). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods, and (3) new mandatory training requirements. Amendments that took effect on January 1, 2020, also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provision regarding IMO type 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for carriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas. Additional amendments, which came into force on June 1, 2022, include (1) addition of a definition of dosage rate, (2) additions to the list of high consequence dangerous goods, (3) new provisions for medical/clinical waste, (4) addition of various ISO standards for gas cylinders, (5) a new handling code, and (6) changes to stowage and segregation provisions. The IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers STCW ). As of February 2017, all seafarers are required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm compliance.

 The IMO s Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water (the Polar Code ). The Polar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as well as environmental protection matters relevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety and pollution prevention as well as recommendatory provisions. The Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and after January 1, 2018, ships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant requirements by the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey. Furthermore, recent action by the IMO s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicates that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. By IMO resolution, administrations are encouraged to ensure that cyber-risk management systems must be incorporated by ship-owners and managers by their first annual Document of Compliance audit after January 1,2021. In February 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard published guidance on addressing cyber risks in a vessel s safety management system. This might cause companies to create additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. The impact of future regulations is hard to predict at this time. In June 2022, SOLAS also set out new amendments that will take effect January 1, 2024, which include new requirements for: (1) the design for safe mooring operations, (2) the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System GMDSS ), (3) watertight integrity, (4) watertight doors on cargo ships, (5) fault-isolation of fire detection systems, (6) life-saving appliances, and (7) safety of ships using LNG as fuel. These new requirements may impact the cost of our operations. Pollution Control and Liability Requirements The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For example, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (the BWM Convention in 2004. The BWM Convention entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. On December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date existing vessels and allows for the installation of ballast water management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC adopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At MEPC 71, the schedule regarding the BWM Convention s implementation dates was also discussed and amendments were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are subject to certain ballast water standards. Those changes were adopted at MEPC 72. Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a D-1 standard, requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The D-2 standard specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most ships, compliance with the D-2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ballast water management systems, which include systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms or biological mechanisms, or which alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in accordance with IMO Guidelines (Regulation D-3). As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72 s amendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems, which governs assessment of ballast water management systems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2 standard. Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by September 8, 2024. Costs of compliance with these regulations may be substantial. Additionally, in November 2020, MEPC 75 adopted amendments to the BWM

 Convention which would require a commissioning test of the ballast water management system for the initial survey or when performing an additional survey for retrofits. This analysis will not apply to ships that already have an installed BWM system certified under the BWM Convention. These amendments entered into force on June 1, 2022. In December 2022, MEPC 79 agreed that it should be permitted to use ballast tanks for temporary storage of treated sewage and grey water. MEPC 79 also established that ships are expected to return to D-2 compliance after experiencing challenging uptake water and bypassing a BWM system should only be used as a last resort. Guidance will be developed at MEPC 80 (in July 2023) to set out appropriate actions and uniform procedures to ensure compliance with the BWM Convention. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we originally entered into agreements for the purchase of ballast water treatments systems for 36 of our vessels. As of December 31, 2022, we have installed such systems on 24 vessels that were not already fitted with a ballast water treatment system upon purchase (excluding eleven vessels that have been sold), and we expect the remaining one to be installed during the first quarter of 2023. After the installation of these ballast water treatment systems, all of our vessels will be in compliance with these standards. Once mid-ocean ballast exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory under the BWM Convention, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and may have a material effect on our operations. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. The system specification requirements for trading in the U.S. have been formalized and we have been installing ballast water treatment systems on our vessels as their special survey deadlines come due. These ballast water treatment systems range in cost from 0.5 million to 1.09 million each, primarily dependent on the size of the vessel. Refer to Capital Expenditures section for further information. The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000 (the CLC ). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel s registered owner may be strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit, the Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the shipowner s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner s intentional or reckless act or omission where the shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships over 2,000 tons covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner s liability for a single incident. We have protection and indemnity insurance for environmental incidents. P I Clubs in the International Group issue the required Bunkers Convention Blue Cards to enable signatory states to issue certificates. All of our vessels are in possession of a CLC State issued certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force. The IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the Bunker Convention to impose strict liability on ship owners (including the registered owner, bareboat charterer, manager or operator) for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the LLMC). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur. Ships are required to maintain a certificate attesting that they maintain adequate insurance to cover an incident. In jurisdictions, such as the United States where the CLC or the Bunker Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or on a strict-liability basis.

 Anti-Fouling Requirements In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the Anti-fouling Convention. The Anti-fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. The exteriors of vessels constructed prior to January 1, 2003 that have not been in drydock must, as of September 17, 2008, either not contain the prohibited compounds or have coatings applied to the vessel exterior that act as a barrier to the leaching of the prohibited compounds. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages will also be required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti-fouling System Certificate, or the IAFS Certificate, is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. Vessels of 24 meters in length or more but less than 400 gross tonnage engaged in international voyages will have to carry a Declaration on Anti-fouling Systems signed by the owner or authorized agent. In November 2020, MEPC 75 approved draft amendments to the Anti-fouling Convention to prohibit anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne, which would apply to ships from January 1, 2023, or, for ships already bearing such an anti-fouling system, at the next scheduled renewal of the system after that date, but no later than 60 months following the last application to the ship of such a system. In addition, the IAFS Certificate has been updated to address compliance options for anti-fouling systems to address cybutryne. Ships which are affected by this ban on cybutryne must receive an updated IAFS Certificate no later than two years after the entry into force of these amendments. Ships which are not affected (i.e. with anti-fouling systems which do not contain cybutryne) must receive an updated IAFS Certificate at the next Anti-fouling application to the vessel. These amendments were formally adopted at MEPC 76 in June 2021. We have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention. Compliance Enforcement Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future . The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations. United States Regulations The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade or operate within the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S. s territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define owner and operator in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations. Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are responsible parties and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel). OPA defines these other damages broadly to include: 
 i. injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs; ii. injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property; iii. loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost; iv. net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources; v. lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and vi. net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources. 
 OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective November 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tank vessels, edible oil tank vessels, and any oil spill response vessels, to the greater of 1,200 per gross ton or 997,100 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). On December 23, 2022, the USCG issued a final rule to adjust the limitation of liability under the OPA. Effective March 23, 2022, the new adjusted limits of OPA liability for non-tank vessels, edible oil tank vessels, and any oil spill response vessels, to the greater of 1,300 per gross ton or 1,076,000 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act. CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of 300 per gross ton or 5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of 300 per gross ton or 500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA. OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We comply and plan to comply going forward with the USCG s financial responsibility regulations by providing applicable certificates of financial responsibility. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in additional regulatory initiatives and statutes, including higher liability caps under OPA, new regulations regarding offshore oil and gas drilling, and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. However, several of these initiatives and regulations have been or may be revised. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement s BSEE revised Production Safety

Table of Contents 
 Systems Rule PSSR ), effective December 27, 2018, modified and relaxed certain environmental and safety protections under the 2016 PSSR. Additionally, the BSEE amended the Well Control Rule, effective July 15, 2019, which rolled back certain reforms regarding the safety of drilling operations, and former U.S. President Trump had proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling. In January 2021, current U.S. President Biden signed an executive order temporarily blocking new leases for oil and gas drilling in federal waters. However, attorney generals from 13 states filed suit in March 2021 to lift the executive order, and in June 2021, a federal judge in Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction against the Biden administration, stating that the power to pause offshore oil and gas leases lies solely with Congress. In August 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana sided with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the other 12 plaintiff states, by issuing a permanent injunction against the Biden Administration s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal public lands and offshore waters. With these rapid changes, compliance with any new requirements of OPA and future legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels could impact the cost of our operations and adversely affect our business. OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. Many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners responsibilities under these laws. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call. While we do not carry oil as cargo, we do carry fuel and lube oil in our drybulk carriers. We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of 1 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows, and ability to pay dividends. Other United States Environmental Regulations The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) CAA requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, some of which regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations which may affect our vessels. The U.S. Clean Water Act CWA prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. In 2015, the EPA expanded the definition of waters of the United States WOTUS ), thereby expanding federal authority under the CWA. Following litigation on the revised WOTUS rule, in December 2018, the EPA and Department of the Army proposed a revised, limited definition of WOTUS. In 2019 and 2020, the agencies repealed the prior WOTUS Rule and promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule NWPR which significantly reduced the scope and oversight of EPA and the Department of the Army in traditionally non-navigable waterways. On August 30, 2021, a federal district court in Arizona vacated the NWPR and directed the agencies to replace the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and the Department of the Army proposed a rule that would reinstate the pre-2015 definition. On December 30, 2022, the EPA and the Department of Army announced the final WOTUS rule that largely reinstated the pre-2015 definition. The EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. Waters. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act VIDA ), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit VGP

 program (which authorizes discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act NISA ), such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters. VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under Clean Water Act (CWA), requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA s promulgation of standards. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force and effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent NOI or retention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required. On October 26, 2020, the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance under VIDA. Within two years after the EPA publishes its final Vessel Incidental Discharge National Standards of Performance, the U.S. Coast Guard must develop corresponding implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations regarding ballast water. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and state regulations could require the installation of ballast water treatment equipment on our vessels or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. European Union Regulations In October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending EU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, requires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause us to incur additional expenses. The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulations also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1 maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel (the so-called SOx-Emission Control Area ). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except the SOx-Emission Control are, use fuels with a 0.5 maximum sulfur content. On September 15, 2020, the European Parliament voted to include greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union s carbon market, the EU Emissions Trading System EU ETS ). On July 14, 2021, the European Parliament formally proposed its plan, which would involve gradually including the maritime sector from 2023 and phasing the sector in over a three-year period. This will require shipowners to buy permits to cover these emissions. The Environment Council adopted a general approach on the proposal in June 2022. On December 18, 2022, the Environmental Council and European Parliament agreed to include maritime shipping emissions within the scope of the EU ETS on a gradual introduction of obligations for shipping companies to surrender allowances: 40 for verified

 emissions from 2024, 70 for 2025 and 100 for 2026. Most large vessels will be included in the scope of the EU ETS from the start. Big offshore vessels of 5,000 gross tonnage and above will be included in the MRV on the monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from maritime transport regulation from 2025 and in the EU ETS from 2027. General cargo vessels and off-shore vessels between 400-5,000 gross tonnage will be included in the MRV regulation from 2025 and their inclusion in EU ETS will be reviewed in 2026 Greenhouse Gas Regulation Our industry currently is heavily dependent on the consumption of fossil fuels, which has been linked by certain experts to greenhouse gas emissions and the warming of the global climate system. We are committed to working to reduce our carbon footprint, including by transitioning to low-carbon fuels while continuing to deliver for our customers. Our governance, strategy, risk management and performance monitoring efforts with respect to managing this challenge continue to evolve. Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The U.S. initially entered into the agreement, but on June 1, 2017, former U.S. President Trump announced that the United States intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and the withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. officially rejoined on February 19, 2021. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, in April 2018, nations at the MEPC 72 adopted an initial strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The initial strategy identifies levels of ambition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including (1) decreasing the carbon intensity from ships through implementation of further phases of the EEDI for new ships; (2) reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40 by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70 by 2050, compared to 2008 emission levels; and (3) reducing the total annual greenhouse emissions by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely. The initial strategy notes that technological innovation, alternative fuels and/or energy sources for international shipping will be integral to achieve the overall ambition. These regulations could cause us to incur additional substantial expenses. At MEPC 77, the Member States agreed to initiate the revision of the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG emissions from ships, recognizing the need to strengthen the ambition during the revision process. MEPC 79 revised the EEDI calculation guidelines to include a CO2 conversion factor for ethane, a reference to the updated ITCC guidelines, and a clarification that in case of a ship with multiple load line certificates, the maximum certified summer draft should be used when determining the deadweight. A final draft Revised IMO GHG Strategy would be considered by MEPC 80 (scheduled to meet in July 2023), with a view to adoption. Various parties, particularly those attending the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference at the end of last year, have called upon the maritime community to increase their ambition regarding decarbonization goals. Genco, among many other companies across the maritime value chain, became a signatory to Call to Action for Shipping Decarbonization focusing on decarbonizing shipping by 2050. The EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20 of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20 under the Kyoto Protocol s second period from 2013 to 2020. Starting in January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports are required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. As noted above, regulations relating to the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector in the European Union s carbon market, EU ETS, are also forthcoming..

 In the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources, and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, former U.S. President Trump signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and in August 2019, the Administration announced plans to weaken regulations for methane emissions. Further, on August 13, 2020, the EPA released rules rolling back standards to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new oil and gas facilities. However, U.S. President Biden recently directed the EPA to publish a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding certain of these rules. On November 2, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule under the CAA designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would reduce 41 million tons of methane emissions between 2023 and 2035 and cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by approximately 74 percent compared to emissions from this sector in 2005. EPA issued a supplemental proposed rule in November 2022 to include additional methane reduction measures following public input and anticipates issuing a final rule in 2023. If these new regulations are finalized, they could affect our operations. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or certain weather events. International Labour Organization The International Labour Organization (the ILO is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 MLC 2006 ). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships that are 500 gross tonnage or over and are either engaged in international voyages or flying the flag of a Member and operating from a port, or between ports, in another country. We believe that all of our vessels are in substantial compliance with and are certified to meet MLC 2006. Vessel Security Regulations Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 MTSA ). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA. Similarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code the ISPS Code ). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate ISSC from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained, expelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention, include, for example, on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel s hull; a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. Future security measures

 could have a significant financial impact on us. We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code. The cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia, including the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea area, as well as off the coast of Western Africa. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or additional security measures, and the risk of uninsured losses could significantly affect our business. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in accordance with Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard. Inspection by Classification Societies The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified in class by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, the IACS. The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or the Rules, which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers contracted for construction on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules attempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies. All of our vessels are certified as being in class by all the applicable Classification Societies (American Bureau of Shipping, DNVGL, or Lloyd s Register of Shipping). All new and secondhand vessels that we purchase must be certified prior to their delivery under our standard agreements. A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be surveyed every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. SEASONALITY We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, there have been seasonal variations in freight and charter rates. We may seek to mitigate the risk of these seasonal variations by entering into long-term time charters for certain of our vessels, where possible. However, this seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results, depending on when we enter into our time charters or if our vessels trade on the spot market. The drybulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. As a result, our revenues could be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and conversely, our revenues could be stronger during the quarters ended December 31 and March 31.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Industry Specific Risk Factors A downturn in the global economic environment may negatively impact our business. If the current global economic environment worsens, we may be negatively affected in a number of ways. As a result of low freight and charter rates that in some instances may not allow us to operate our vessels profitably, our earnings and cash flows could decline. Continuation of these types of conditions for a prolonged period may leave us with insufficient cash resources for our operations or required debt repayments under our credit facility, which would potentially accelerate the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If our earnings and cash flows decline for a prolonged period, we may also breach one or more of our credit facility covenants, such as those relating to our minimum cash balance, collateral maintenance, or minimum working capital. This also would potentially accelerate the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, our charterers may fail to meet their obligations under our time charter and freight agreements. A significant number of our vessels port calls involve loading or discharging raw materials and semi-finished products in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, a negative change in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, particularly in China, India, or Japan, could adversely affect our business. In recent years, China has been one of the world s fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, and our business substantially depends on economic activity in China. While China has relaxed its zero tolerance policy toward COVID-19, the Chinese government could reimpose stricter measures against COVID-19, which could have a negative effect on Chinese economic activity. Moreover, to the extent the Chinese government does not pursue economic growth and urbanization generally, including infrastructure stimulus spending, the level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected, as well as by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other Chinese government policies. The Chinese government may adopt policies that favor domestic drybulk shipping companies and may hinder our ability to compete with them effectively. The Chinese government has also taken actions seen as protecting domestic industries such as coal or steel, which may reduce the demand for China-bound drybulk cargoes and negatively impact the drybulk industry. Moreover, a significant or protracted slowdown in the economies of the U.S., the European Union or various Asian countries may adversely affect economic growth in China and elsewhere. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions, especially involving China, could adversely impact global economic conditions and, as a result, the amount of cargo transported on drybulk vessels. As an example of such restrictions, and most notable in term of drybulk trade volumes, China imposed tariffs on U.S. soybean exports in 2019 as part of the U.S.-China trade dispute. A deterioration in the trading relationship or a re-escalation of protectionist measures taken between these countries or others could lead to reduced drybulk trade volumes. Freight and charterhire rates for drybulk carriers could decrease in the future, which may adversely affect our earnings . A prolonged downturn in the drybulk charter market, from which we derive the large majority of our revenues, has been volatile over the past five years. The Baltic Dry Index BDI ), an index published by The Baltic Exchange of shipping rates for key drybulk routes increased during 2021 after a decline in 2020 principally caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while another firm year was seen in 2022. There can be no assurance that the drybulk charter market will not experience future downturns. Shipping capacity supply and demand strongly influences freight rates. Factors that influence demand include 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 demand for and production of drybulk products; global and regional economic and political conditions, including developments in international trade, fluctuations in industrial and agricultural production and armed conflicts; the distance drybulk cargo is to be moved by sea; environmental and other regulatory developments; events impacting production of the commodities that we carry; and changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns. Factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include the number of newbuilding deliveries; port and canal congestion; scrapping of older vessels; vessel casualties; conversion of vessels to other uses; the number of vessels out of service (laid-up, drydocked, awaiting repairs or otherwise not available for hire); and environmental concerns and regulations. In addition to prevailing and anticipated freight rates, factors that affect the rate of newbuilding, scrapping and laying-up include newbuilding prices, secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices, costs of fuel and other operating costs, costs associated with classification society surveys, normal maintenance and insurance coverage, the efficiency and age profile of the existing fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices, particularly environmental protection laws and regulations. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments, including a change in worldwide fleet capacity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay dividends, and ability to continue as a going concern. Although vessel supply growth rates have slowed in recent years, if the supply of newbuilding vessels outpaces the demand for vessels, it could negatively impact freight rates and charterhire rates. If market conditions deteriorate following our vessels current employment, we may not be able to employ our vessels at profitable rates or at all. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay dividends, and ability to continue as a going concern. Prolonged declines in freight and charter rates, changes in the useful life of vessels, and other market deterioration could cause us to incur impairment charges. We evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to determine if events have occurred that would require us to evaluate our vessels for an impairment of their carrying amounts. The recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed based on events and changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered. The review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires us to make various estimates including future freight rates and earnings from the vessels. All of these items have been historically volatile. We determine each vessel s recoverable amount by estimating the vessel s undiscounted future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel s carrying amount, the vessel is deemed impaired and written down to its fair market value. Our vessels carrying values may not represent their fair market value because market prices of secondhand vessels tend to fluctuate with freight and charter rate changes and the cost of newbuildings. Any impairment charges incurred as a result of declines in freight and charter rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay dividends, and ability to continue as a going concern. Inflation could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. Inflation could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results by increasing the costs of labor and materials needed to operate our business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we have experienced increased costs for crew, spares, and stores, which we currently expect to continue into 2023. In an inflationary environment such as the current economic environment, depending on the drybulk industry and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise our charter rates enough to offset the increasing costs of our operations, which would decrease our profit margins. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain its spread have impacted the markets in which we operate and could have a material adverse impact on our business and its operations.

 The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain it have negatively impacted regional and global economies and trade patterns in markets in which we operate, the way we operate our business, and the businesses of our charterers and suppliers. These negative impacts could continue or worsen, even though the pandemic has diminished and measures to contain its spread have been relaxed. The pandemic may have far-reaching repercussions on our business and industry that are currently unknown. The pandemic resulted in reduced industrial activity in China on which our business substantially depends, as well as in other major industrial and financial centers, including the U.S., the E.U., Japan, India, South Korea and Brazil. Declines in worldwide, regional, or national economic conditions and activity could reduce demand for drybulk cargoes and shipping services and may negatively affect our charters, suppliers, and other parties with which we do business. We also face risks to our personnel and operations due to COVID-19, as our crews face risk of exposure as a result of travel, and our shore-based personnel likewise face such exposure, as we are headquartered in New York and have offices in other major metropolitan areas. Disruption of normal business activities due to COVID-19 and the imposition of measures against its spread may result in operational disruptions and delays, including increases in deviation and incremental fuel consumption. We have and may continue to incur additional expenses associated with testing, personal protective equipment, quarantines, and travel expenses such as airfare costs, in order to perform crew rotations. Some ports reimposed restrictions that affected crew rotations during the first half of 2022. Measures against COVID-19 in a number of countries have restricted crew rotations on our vessels, which could continue or become more restrictive. Although conditions have significantly improved and our COVID-19 exposure related risk has declined over time, we may experience disruptions to our normal vessel operations caused by increased deviation time from positioning our vessels where we can undertake a crew rotation and we may incur additional expenses in the future. Our 450 Million Credit Facility contains collateral maintenance covenants that require the aggregate appraised value of collateral vessels to be at least 140 of the principal amount of the loan outstanding under such facility. If the values of our vessels were to decline as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, we may not satisfy this covenant. If we do not satisfy the collateral maintenance requirement, we will need to post additional collateral or prepay outstanding loans to bring us back into compliance or seek waivers, which may not be available or may be subject to conditions. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental and operational safety laws that could require significant expenditures or subject us to increased liability . Governments regulate our business and vessel operations through international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations. Various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates, and financial assurances regarding our operations. Given frequent regulatory changes, we cannot predict their effect on our ability to do business, the cost of complying with them, or their impact on vessels useful lives or resale value. Our failure to comply with any such conventions, laws, or regulations could cause us to incur substantial liability. See Overview Environmental and Other Regulation in Item 1, Business of this annual report. Increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of the contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us. Changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us. Such changes could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.

 Our vessels are exposed to international risks that could reduce revenue or increase expenses. Our vessels are at risk of damage or loss because of events such as mechanical failure, collision, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, cargo loss and bad weather. All these can result in death or injury to persons, repair and other increased costs, loss of revenues, loss or damage to property (including cargo), environmental damage, higher insurance rates, damage to our customer relationships, harm to our reputation as a safe and reliable operator and delay or rerouting. Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, could adversely impact our and our customers operations. Changing economic, regulatory and political conditions, including political and military conflicts, have resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways, piracy, terrorism, labor strikes and boycotts. Our vessels may operate in dangerous areas, including areas of the South China Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, the Gulf of Guinea, and the Red Sea. In November 2013, the Chinese government announced an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) covering much of the East China Sea. A number of nations do not honor the ADIZ, which includes certain maritime areas that have been contested among various nations in the region. Tensions relating to the Chinese ADIZ or other territorial disputes may escalate and result in interference with shipping routes or in market disruptions. In recent years, tensions have been rising between the U.S. and China as a result of significantly increased Chinese military flights into Taiwan s air defense zone, U.S. claims that China tested a hypersonic missile, and the establishment of the AUKUS pact among Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. under which the U.S. is to assist Australia in developing a nuclear submarine program. In addition, China imposed restrictions on the imports of coal and certain other products from Australia following Australia s alignment with the U.S. on a number of issues, which China perceived as adverse to its interests. Developments around these restrictions are dynamic and uncertain. The escalation of such trade issues or tensions or development of any military conflict could result in interference with shipping routes or in market disruptions. In addition, unfavorable weather conditions brought on by climate change or otherwise could result in disruption to our operations or require infrastructure adaptations or new or different investments for our vessels. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. Our vessels may suffer damage, resulting in unexpected drydocking costs. If our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility for substantial and unpredictable costs that may not be fully covered by insurance. Space at drydocking facilities is sometimes limited, and not all drydocking facilities are conveniently located. The loss of earnings while our vessels are not operable could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. The operation of drybulk vessels has certain unique operational risks which could affect our earnings and cash flow . A drybulk vessel s cargo and its interaction with the vessel can be an operational risk. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure. Drybulk vessels are often subjected to battering treatment that may damage the vessel during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold) and small bulldozers. Vessels so damaged may be more susceptible to hull breaches, which may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds. This may cause the bulk cargo to become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure buckles the vessel s bulkheads, leading to the loss of a vessel. If we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels, we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. In addition, the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have continued and could adversely affect our business. Acts of piracy have historically affected vessels trading in such regions as the South China Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, the Gulf of Guinea, and the Red Sea. Piracy incidents continue to occur particularly in the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Guinea and increasingly in Southeast Asia. Our vessels could be subject to detention hijacking as a result of acts of piracy, rendering our vessels unable to perform their charters and earn revenues. Moreover, if these piracy attacks result in regions characterized by insurers as war risk zones, or Joint War Committee (JWC) war and strikes listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase 
 27

 significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain, if available at all. In addition, crew costs, including costs that may be incurred to the extent we employ onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents. In response to piracy incidents, following consultation with regulatory authorities, we may station guards on some of our vessels. This may increase our risk of liability for death or injury to persons or damage to personal property, and we may not have adequate insurance in place to cover such liability. The occurrence of any of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Acts of war, terrorist attacks, and other acts of violence may have an adverse effect on our business. On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine leading to what is now a multi-month war and a humanitarian crisis. The impact to date on the drybulk market has been a redirection of cargo flows, higher commodity prices, slower vessels speeds due to increased fuel prices, a rush to secure commodities given the tightness in the global energy complex as well as global grain supplies, and sanctions on various Russian exports. The U.S., Europe and other countries have imposed unprecedented economic sanctions in response to Russian actions which could be increased with uncertain effects on the drybulk market and the world economy. In addition, the U.S. and certain other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries have been supplying Ukraine with military aid. The longer term impact of Russia s war in Ukraine remains unknown, which may take some time to materialize. Russia and Ukraine export significant volumes of coal and grain cargoes. A reduction of these exports as well as the global effect of these reduced supplies may result in lower trade volumes, higher commodity prices, increased inflation, and potential demand destruction. U.S. officials have also warned of the increased possibility of Russian cyberattacks, which could disrupt the operations of businesses involved in the drybulk industry, including ours. As a reaction to higher energy prices, China has chosen to increase domestic coal production as a way to bolster energy security. The scope or intensity of the ongoing military conflict as well as sanctions and other actions undertaken in response to it could increase, potentially having negative effects on the global economy and markets. While Ukraine and Russia reached an agreement to extend an arrangement allowing shipment of grain from Ukrainian ports through a humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea in November 2022, the agreement could be terminated before its expiration date in March 2023, or the agreement may not be renewed. Any of these occurrences, or the continuation or worsening of any such occurrences, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. In addition, terrorist attacks continue to cause uncertainty in the world s financial markets and may affect our business. Continuing conflicts and recent developments in the Middle East and the presence of U.S. and other armed forces in the Middle East may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict, which may contribute to further economic instability. Following the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed to on July 14, 2015 regarding the Iranian nuclear program, tensions have been rising between Iran on the one hand and the U.S. and its allies on the other. As our vessels transit the Arabian Gulf from time to time, they may face increased risk of damage or seizure. Political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be costly and could reduce our net cash flows and net income. The hull and machinery of commercial vessels must be certified as being in class by a classification society authorized by its country of registry and undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys and special surveys as described in Item 1., Business Classification and Inspection in this report. If any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual, intermediate or special survey, the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and unemployable, and we could be in violation of certain covenants in our credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. If our vessels call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments, that could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common shares. All of our charters with customers prohibit our vessels from entering any countries or conducting any trade prohibited by the U.S. However, on such customers instructions, our vessels could call on ports in countries subject to 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 sanctions or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Sudan and Syria. Moreover, the ongoing war in Ukraine could result in the imposition of further economic sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union against Russia. Current or future counterparties of ours may be affiliated with persons or entities that are or may be in the future the subject of sanctions imposed by the governments of the U.S., European Union, and/or other international bodies . Any violation of sanctions and embargo laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us. Additionally, some investors may decide to divest their interest, or not to invest, in us simply because we do business with companies that do business in sanctioned countries. Moreover, our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels, and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation. War, terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries may adversely affect investor perception of the value of our common stock. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, and other applicable worldwide anti-corruption laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other applicable worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws include the U.K. Bribery Act, which is broader in scope than the FCPA, as it contains no facilitating payments exception. We charter our vessels into some jurisdictions that international monitoring groups have identified as having high levels of corruption. Our activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees or agents that could violate the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Our policies mandate compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws. If we violate the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate our business. Our success largely depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense. Any inability that GSSM or we experience in the future to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Labor interruptions could disrupt our business. Our vessels are manned by masters, officers and crews employed by third parties. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, labor unrest could prevent or hinder our normal operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. The smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto our vessels may lead to governmental claims against us. Our vessels sometimes call in ports in South America and other areas where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels. To the extent our vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull and regardless of our crew s knowledge, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Arrests of our vessels by maritime claimants could cause a significant loss of earnings for the related off-hire period. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings for the related off-hire period. In addition, in jurisdictions where the sister ship theory of liability applies, a claimant may arrest the vessel subject to the claimant s maritime lien and any associated vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings. A government of a vessel s registry could requisition for title or seize our vessels. A government could also requisition our vessels for hire, becoming the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Such requisitioning of one or more of our vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Changes in fuel prices could adversely affect our profits. We operate a large portion of our vessels on spot market voyage charters, which generally require the vessel owner to bear the cost of fuel in the form of bunkers, a significant operating expense. Depending on the timing of increases in the price of fuel and market conditions, we may be unable to pass along fuel price increases to our customers. In standard time charter arrangements, under which the balance of our vessels operate, the charterer bears the cost of fuel bunkers. At the commencement of a charter, the charterer purchases fuel from us at then-prevailing market rates, and we must repurchase fuel at that same initial rate when the charterer redelivers the vessel to us. Market rates at the time the charterer redelivers the vessel may be more or less than the prevailing market rates at the commencement of the charter. In certain of our short-term time charter agreements, we sell the charterer the amount of the bunkers actually consumed and the charterer is required to redeliver the vessel to us without replenishment of the bunkers consumed. The date of redelivery of vessels and fluctuations in the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and therefore, these arrangements could result in losses or reductions in working capital that are beyond our control. As part of our approach to comply with IMO regulations that limit sulfur emissions, we retrofitted our 17 Capesize vessels with scrubbers. The performance of our investment in scrubbers depends in part upon the fuel spread between compliant low sulfur fuel and high sulfur fuel. Any decrease in the spread between these two fuel types could reduce the return for this investment. In addition, certain countries have imposed regulations regarding the operations of scrubbers. These restrictions could become more restrictive or widespread, and we may be further limited in or prevented from operating scrubbers on our vessels as a result. See General IMO 2020 Compliance in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition for further details. To the extent we cannot operate scrubbers on our vessels, we would no longer be able to recover our investment in scrubbers and would have to use low sulfur fuel instead. Low sulfur fuel, which we currently use in our minor bulk fleet is more expensive than standard marine fuel. Increased demand for low sulfur fuel has resulted in an increase in prices for such fuel and may result in further increases, which we may not be able to include in our freight rates. To mitigate the risk associated with fuel price increases, we may enter into forward bunker contracts that permit us to purchase fuel at a fixed price in exchange for payment of a certain amount. We may incur a loss on such contracts if the price of fuel declines below the price at which the contract permits us to purchase fuel, or a significant increase in the price of fuel may not be mitigated by our entry into any such contracts. Either occurrence could h ave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows, and ability to pay dividends. Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, freight and charter rates. This seasonality may result in quarterly volatility in our operating results, depending on when and whether we enter into time charters or trade on the spot market. The drybulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. As a result, our revenues could be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and conversely, our revenue could be stronger during the quarters ended December 31 and March 31. This seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.

 Company Specific Risk Factors Our earnings and our ability to pay dividends will be adversely affected if we do not successfully employ our vessels. The charterhire rates for our vessels have sometimes declined below the operating costs of our vessels. Because we currently charter most of our vessels on spot market voyage charters, we are exposed to the cyclicality and volatility of the spot charter market, and we do not have significant long-term, fixed-rate time charters to ameliorate the adverse effects of downturns in the spot market. Capesize vessels, which we operate as part of our fleet, have been particularly susceptible to significant freight rate fluctuations in spot charter rates. Spot market voyage charter rates may fluctuate dramatically based primarily on the worldwide supply of drybulk vessels and the worldwide demand for transportation of drybulk cargoes. Future freight rates and charterhire rates may not enable us to operate our vessels profitably. Further, our standard time charter contracts with our customers specify certain performance parameters that can result in customer claims if not met. Such claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. To the extent our vessels undertake spot market voyages, we face operational risks from responsibility for delays in delivery of the cargo, which may be due to weather, vessel breakdown, port congestion, or other factors that may be beyond our control. Such delays can result in customer claims. In addition, spot market voyages require us to make payments directly to third parties that our charterers would ordinarily make. Such arrangements carry a risk of disputes and fraud by third parties. As a result of any of these circumstances, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. In addition, while we try to capture arbitrage opportunities by taking cargo positions, a significant fluctuation in the rate environment could adversely affect profitability. We may face liquidity issues if conditions in the drybulk market worsen for a prolonged period. While supply and demand fundamentals have improved starting in 2017, if the market environment declines over a prolonged period of time, we may have insufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations or satisfy our obligations under our credit facility, which may lead to a default under our credit facility. As a result, the repayment of our indebtedness could potentially be accelerated, and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay dividends. The market values of our vessels may decrease, which could adversely affect our operating results. If the book value of one of our vessels is impaired due to unfavorable market conditions or a vessel is sold at a price below its book value, we would incur a loss that could adversely affect our financial results. See Impairment of long-lived assets section under the heading Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. Restrictive covenants under our credit facility may restrict our growth and operations. Our credit facility imposes operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to utilize cash above a certain amount; incur additional indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all; incur liens on our assets; sell our vessels or the capital stock of our subsidiaries; make investments; engage in mergers or acquisitions; pay dividends; make capital expenditures; compete effectively or change management arrangements relating to any of our vessels. Therefore, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some corporate actions, which we may not be able to obtain when needed. This may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest and from executing our business strategy of growth and may restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends and finance our future operations. We depend upon ten charterers for a large part of our revenues. The loss of any significant customers could adversely affect our financial performance.

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 39 of our revenues were derived from ten charterers. While we are seeking to expand customer relationships with cargo providers, this may not sufficiently diversify our customer base to mitigate this risk. If we were to lose any of our major customers or if any of them significantly reduced use of our services or were unable to make payments to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. The aging of our fleet and our practice of purchasing and operating previously owned vessels may result in increased operating costs and vessels off-hire, which could adversely affect our earnings. The majority of our drybulk carriers were previously owned by third parties. We may seek additional growth by acquiring previously owned vessels. The pre-inspection of such vessels does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. We may not detect all defects or problems before purchase. Any such defects or problems may be expensive to repair, and if not timely detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable. Also, we do not receive the benefit of any builder warranties if the vessels we buy are older than one year. The costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition generally increase with its age. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient than newer ones due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. We may not be able to incur borrowings on favorable terms or at all to fund the cost of maintaining our vessels. Governmental regulations and safety and other equipment standards related to vessel age may require expenditures for vessel equipment and restrict our vessels activities. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably. As a result, regulations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. An increase in interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. We are subject to market risks relating to changes in LIBOR rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding. Moreover, i n the recent past, concerns have been publicized that some of the member banks surveyed by the British Bankers Association BBA in connection with the calculation of LIBOR may have been underreporting or otherwise manipulating the inter-bank lending rate applicable to them. A number of BBA member banks entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged LIBOR manipulation, and investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions are ongoing. In addition, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. All LIBOR tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. This means that any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will be converted to a replacement rate. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a committee of private sector entities convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR plus a recommended spread adjustment as LIBOR s replacement. LIBOR and SOFR have significant differences, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. If our LIBOR-based borrowings are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in higher interest costs than if LIBOR remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our credit facility specifies that upon cessation of the LIBOR rate, borrowings will bear interest at a rate based on SOFR. If LIBOR or any alternative reference rate were to increase significantly, the amount of interest payable on our outstanding indebtedness could increase significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. We depend significantly on our GSSM joint venture for technical management of our fleet.

 We formed the GSSM joint venture for technical management of our fleet, including fulfilling the functions of crewing, maintenance and repair services. The failure of GSSM to perform its obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. Although we may have rights against GSSM if it defaults on its obligations to us, our shareholders will share that recourse only indirectly to the extent that we recover funds. We may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources in the drybulk industry. We employ our vessels in a highly competitive, capital intensive, and fragmented market. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources than ours. Competition for the transportation of drybulk cargoes can be intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its managers to the charterers. Competitors with greater resources could enter and operate larger and better fleets that offer better prices than ours. Future dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors; dividends and share repurchases are limited under our credit facility. Our declaration and payment of dividends is subject to legally available funds, compliance with law and contractual obligations and our Board of Directors determination that each declaration and payment is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. Our policy may change in the future, and we have no legal obligation to continue paying dividends at the same rate or at all. Under our credit facility, we may not declare or pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result of the declaration or we would not be in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants after giving effect to the dividend. Any dividend or stock repurchase is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. The principal business factors that our Board of Directors expects to consider when determining the timing and amount of dividend payments or stock repurchases include our earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements at the time. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends or stock repurchases other than from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by such a payment or repurchase. We may incur other expenses or liabilities that would reduce or eliminate cash available for dividends. We may also enter into agreements or the Marshall Islands or another jurisdiction may adopt laws or regulations that further restrict our ability to pay dividends. If we decrease, suspend or terminate our dividends, our stock price may decline. We may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth, which could cause us to incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities. Our future growth depends on a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include our ability to identify vessels for acquisition; consummate acquisitions or establish joint ventures on favorable terms; integrate acquired vessels successfully with our existing operations; expand our customer base; and obtain required financing for our existing and new operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had 212.9 million of availability under our credit facility. These limitations place restrictions on financing that we could use for our growth. We currently maintain all of our cash and cash equivalents with six financial institutions, which causes credit risk. We currently maintain all of our cash and cash equivalents with six financial institutions. None of our balances are covered by insurance in the event of default by the financial institutions As a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations or to make dividend payments. As a holding company, we have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay dividends depends on the ability of 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 our subsidiaries, which are all directly or indirectly wholly owned, to distribute funds to us. In turn, the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us depends on their results of operations. We are at risk for the creditworthiness of our charterers. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, and any defaults by them, or market conditions affecting the time charter market and the credit markets, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources that may be required to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing at all or at a higher than anticipated cost may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. If we cannot obtain certain reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, it could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in this and each of our future annual reports on Form 10-K a report containing our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, if we are an accelerated or large accelerated filer, a related attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm. If, in such future annual reports on Form 10-K, our management cannot provide a report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified attestation report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting if required by Section 404, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. We may not have adequate insurance to compensate us if we lose our vessels or to compensate third parties. We are insured against tort claims and some contractual claims (including claims related to environmental damage and pollution) through memberships in protection and indemnity associations or clubs, or P I associations. A P I association provides mutual insurance based on the aggregate tonnage of a member s vessels entered into the association. Claims are paid through the aggregate premiums of all members, although members remain subject to calls for additional funds if the aggregate premiums are insufficient to cover claims submitted to the association. Claims submitted to the association may include those incurred by members of the association, as well as claims submitted to the association from other P I associations with which our P I association has entered into interassociation agreements. The P I associations to which we belong might not remain viable, or we may become subject to funding calls that could adversely affect us. We also carry hull and machinery insurance and war risk insurance for our fleet. We also currently maintain insurance against loss of hire for our major bulk vessels, which covers business interruptions that result in the loss of use of a vessel. We may not be able to renew our insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition, our insurance may be voidable by the insurers as a result of certain of our actions. Further, our insurance policies may not cover all losses that we incur, and disputes over insurance claims could arise with our insurance carriers. Any claims covered by insurance would be subject to deductibles. In addition, our insurance policies are subject to limitations and exclusions, which may increase our costs or lower our revenues. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends. We may have to pay U.S. tax on U.S. source income, which will reduce our net income and cash flows. If we do not qualify for an exemption pursuant to Section 883 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code (which we refer to as the Section 883 exemption ), then we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our shipping income that is derived from U.S. sources. If we are subject to such tax, our net income and cash flows would be reduced by the amount of such tax. We will qualify for the Section 883 exemption if, among other things, (i) our stock is treated as primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the U.S. (the publicly traded test ), or (ii) we satisfy the qualified shareholder test or (iii) we satisfy the controlled foreign corporation test (the CFC test ). Under applicable Treasury 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 Regulations, the publicly-traded test cannot be satisfied in any taxable year in which persons who actually or constructively own 5 or more of our stock (which we sometimes refer to as 5 shareholders ), together own 50 or more of our stock (by vote and value) for more than half the days in such year (the five percent override rule ), unless an exception applies. A foreign corporation satisfies the qualified shareholder test if more than 50 of the value of its outstanding shares is owned (or treated as owned by applying certain attribution rules) for at least half of the number of days in the foreign corporation s taxable year by one or more qualified shareholders. A qualified shareholder includes a foreign corporation that, among other things, satisfies the publicly traded test. A foreign corporation satisfies the CFC test if it is a controlled foreign corporation and one or more qualified U.S. persons own more than 50 of the total value of all the outstanding stock. Based on the ownership and trading of our stock in 2022 and 2021, we believe that we satisfied the publicly traded test and qualified for the Section 883 exemption in 2022 and 2021. If we do not qualify for the Section 883 exemption, our U.S. source shipping income, i.e., 50 of our gross shipping income attributable to transportation beginning or ending in the U.S., would be subject to a 4 tax without allowance for deductions (the U.S. gross transportation income tax ). We can provide no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by 5 shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for the Section 883 exemption in 2023 or future taxable years. In fact, we did not qualify for the Section 883 exemption in 2017. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. To the extent Genco s U.S. source shipping income, or other U.S. source income, is considered to be effectively connected income, any such income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to the U.S. federal corporate income tax, currently imposed at a 21 rate. In addition, Genco may be subject to a 30 branch profits tax on such income, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of such trade or business. Shipping income is generally sourced 100 to the U.S. if attributable to transportation exclusively between U.S. ports (Genco is prohibited from conducting such voyages), 50 to the U.S. if attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but does not both begin and end, in the U.S. and otherwise 0 to the U.S. Genco s U.S. source shipping income would be considered effectively connected income only if (i) Genco has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income; and (ii) substantially all of Genco s U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S. Genco does not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any vessel sailing to or from the U.S. on a regularly scheduled basis. Based on the current shipping operations of Genco and Genco s expected future shipping operations and other activities, Genco believes that none of its U.S. source shipping income will constitute effectively connected income. However, Genco may from time to time generate non-shipping income that may be treated as effectively connected income. If Genco qualifies for the Section 883 exemption in respect of its shipping income, gain from the sale of a vessel likewise should be exempt from tax under Section 883 of the Code. If, however, Genco s shipping income does not qualify for the Section 883 exemption, and assuming that any gain derived from the sale of a vessel is attributable to Genco s U.S. office, as Genco believes would likely be the case, such gain would likely be treated as effectively connected income (determined under rules different from those discussed above) and subject to the net income and branch profits tax regime described above. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders. A foreign corporation generally will be treated as a passive foreign investment company, which we sometimes refer to as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, after applying certain look through rules, either (1) at least 75 of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or (2) at least 50 of the average value or adjusted bases of its assets (determined on a quarterly basis) produce or are held for the production of passive income, i.e., passive assets. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax

Table of Contents 
 regime with respect to distributions they receive from the PFIC and gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their stock in the PFIC. For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations. Income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute passive income unless such income was treated under specific rules as derived from the active conduct of a trade or business. We do not believe that our past or existing operations would cause, or would have caused, us to be deemed a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard, we treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time and spot chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that (1) our income from our time and spot chartering activities does not constitute passive income and (2) the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets. While there is no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our method of operation, there is legal authority supporting this position consisting of pronouncements by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we sometimes refer to as the IRS ), concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also legal authority, consisting of case law, which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. No assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year because the PFIC test is an annual test, there are uncertainties in the application of the PFIC rules, and although we intend to manage our business so as to avoid PFIC status to the extent consistent with our other business goals, there could be changes in the nature and extent of our operations in future taxable years. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the Code (which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder), such shareholder would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the highest applicable ordinary income tax rates upon the receipt of excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common stock, plus interest on such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder s holding period of our common stock. Because we generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars but incur a portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could hurt our business. We generate all of our revenues in U.S. dollars, but we may incur drydocking costs, voyage expenses (such as port costs), special survey fees and other expenses in other currencies. If our expenditures on such costs and fees were significant, and the U.S. dollar were weak against such currencies, our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends could be adversely affected. Legislative action relating to taxation could materially and adversely affect us. Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. For example, on October 8, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced that 136 countries and jurisdictions of the 140 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on base erosion and profit shifting have agreed on a framework to subject certain multinational enterprises to a minimum 15 tax rate. While the United States has signed the agreement, the Marshall Islands is not among the signatories. The agreement would also reallocate certain taxing rights over multinational enterprises from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits regardless of whether the multinational enterprises have a 
 36

 physical presence in such markets. While international shipping income may be exempt from some or all of the provisions included in the agreement, the impact of these provisions is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Because we are a foreign corporation, you may not have the same rights or protections that a shareholder in a U.S. corporation may have. We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate law and may make it more difficult for our shareholders to protect their interests. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws and the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the U.S., and the BCA specifically incorporates the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions. However, the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors and shareholder rights are not as clearly established under Marshall Islands law as they are in certain U.S. jurisdictions, and there have been few judicial cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to protect their interests. Future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The market price of our common stock could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all or which may dilute our common stock or adversely affect its market price. We may require additional capital to expand our business and increase revenues, add liquidity in response to negative economic conditions, meet unexpected liquidity needs, and reduce our outstanding debt. To the extent our existing capital and borrowing capabilities are insufficient, we will need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings, including offerings of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, or rights to acquire our common stock or curtail our growth and reduce our assets or restructure arrangements with existing security holders. Any equity or debt financing, or additional borrowings, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity financings could result in dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. To the extent that an existing shareholder does not purchase shares of voting stock, that shareholder s interest in our company will be diluted, representing a smaller percentage of the vote in our Board of Directors elections and other shareholder decisions. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Volatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock could adversely impact its trading price. The market price of our common stock, could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. A decrease in the market price of our common stock would adversely impact the value of your shares of common stock.

 Provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may have anti-takeover effects which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Several provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, lessen our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to maximize shareholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire our company. However, these provisions could also discourage, delay or prevent (1) the merger or acquisition of our company through a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise that a shareholder may consider in its best interest and (2) the removal of incumbent officers and directors. Election and Removal of Directors. Our articles of incorporation prohibit cumulative voting in the director elections. Our by-laws require parties other than the board of directors to give advance written notice of nominations for director elections. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent the removal of incumbent officers or directors. Limited Actions by Shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and our by-laws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our shareholders must be effected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders or by our shareholders unanimous written consent. Our articles of incorporation and our by-laws provide that, subject to certain exceptions, our Chairman, President, or Secretary at the direction of the Board of Directors or our Secretary at the request of one or more shareholders that hold in the aggregate at least a majority of our outstanding shares entitled to vote may call special meetings of shareholders. The business transacted at the special meeting is limited to the purposes stated in the notice. Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our by-laws provide that shareholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the corporate secretary. Generally, the notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. Our by-laws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder s notice. These provisions may impede a shareholder s ability to bring matters before or nominate directors at an annual meeting of shareholders. It may not be possible for our investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us. We and most of our subsidiaries are organized in the Marshall Islands. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. shareholders to serve process within the U.S. upon us or to enforce judgment upon us for civil liabilities in U.S. courts. You should not assume that courts in the countries in which we are incorporated or where our assets are located (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us based upon these laws. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and expose us to liability. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store information and manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We also collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data. Despite our cybersecurity measures, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, which could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We do not own any real property. Effective April 4, 2011, we entered into a seven-year sub-sublease agreement for our main office in New York, New York. The term of the sub-sublease commenced June 1, 2011, with a free base rental period until October 31, 2011. Following the expiration of the free base rental period, the monthly base rental payments were 0.1 million per month until May 31, 2015 and thereafter were 0.1 million per month until the end of the seven-year term. We also entered into a direct lease with the over-landlord of such office space that commenced immediately upon the expiration of such sub-sublease agreement, for a term covering the period from May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2025; the direct lease provided for a free base rental period from May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018. Following the expiration of the free base rental period, the monthly base rental payments are 0.2 million per month from October 1, 2018 to April 30, 2023 and 0.2 million per month from May 1, 2023 to September 30, 2025. Future minimum rental payments on the above lease for the next four years are as follows: 2.4 million for 2023, 2.5 million for 2024 and 1.8 million for 2025. On June 14, 2019, we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of this leased space for our main office in New York, New York that commenced on July 26, 2019 and will end on September 29, 2025. There was a free base rental period for the first four and a half months commencing on July 26, 2019. Following the expiration of the free base rental period, the monthly base sublease income is 0.1 million per month until September 29, 2025. In addition, during October 2017 we entered into a lease for office space in Singapore that expired in January 2019. A lease was signed for a new office space in Singapore effective January 17, 2019 for a three-year term, which has been extended effective January 17, 2022 for a two-year term. Lastly, during July 2018, we entered into a lease for office space in Copenhagen which commenced on July 1, 2018 and ended on April 30, 2019. A lease was signed for a new office space in Copenhagen effective May 1, 2019 which ended January 31, 2023. During June 2022, a lease was signed for a new office space in Copenhagen effective January 1, 2023 for a minimum period ending January 1, 2025. For a description of our vessels, see Our Fleet in Item 1, Business in this report. Thirty-nine of the vessels in our current fleet serve as collateral under our credit facility. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Policies Vessels and Depreciation in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for a further description. The foregoing descriptions are incorporated into this Item 2 by reference. We consider each of our significant properties to be suitable for its intended use. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On December 14, 2022, a sub-charterer of the Genco Constellation asserted a claim for monetary losses in connection with alleged delays of the loading of their cargo, short loading, or both at the port of Longkou, China. Hizone Group Co. Ltd Hizone had sub-chartered the vessel from SCM Cooperation Limited, which in turn had subchartered the vessel from BG Shipping Co. Limited, who had chartered the vessel from us. A dispute arose due to the need to restow the cargo to ensure the safety of the crew and the vessel. Following the vessel s arrival at Tema Harbour in Ghana, Hizone petitioned the Superior Court of Judicature to have the vessel arrested in connection with a claim alleging damages. Such petition was granted on December 14, 2022 and although Genco offered security to release the vessel shortly thereafter, the vessel has still not been released. Moreover, Hizone petitioned the Superior Court of Judicature to have the vessel arrested again on February 2, 2023 on an allegedly different claim. The vessel has not been generating revenue while it has been subject to arrest and will not generate revenue unless and until it is released. The Company believes that these claims are without merit, has valid defenses against them and is vigorously defending them while continuing to seek the release of the Genco Constellation and any damages arising from the arrest of the vessel, including the recovery of lost revenue while arrested and reimbursement of legal fees as well as taking actions to secure counter security from BG Shipping Co. Limited. The claim has not had a significant effect on our 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 results of operations or cash flows to date, and we do not anticipate that it will have such an effect in the future, although there can be no assurance that it will not. We are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe are likely to have, or have had a significant effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, nor are we aware of any other proceedings that are pending or threatened which we believe are likely to have a significant effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. We expect that these claims would be covered by insurance, subject to customary deductibles. These claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES MARKET INFORMATION, HOLDERS AND DIVIDENDS Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol GNK. As of February 22, 2023, there were approximately six holders of record of our common stock. On April 19, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted a new quarterly dividend policy commencing in the first quarter of 2022 in respect to our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021 based on a formula. Our quarterly dividend policy and declaration and payment of dividends are subject to legally available funds, compliance with applicable laws and contractual obligations (including our credit facility) and our Board s determination that each declaration and payment is at that time in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders after its review of our financial performance. For a discussion of restrictions applicable to our payment of dividends as well as the formula for calculating the quarterly dividends, please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation below.

 PART II ITEM 6. (Reserved) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The MD A generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. We are a Marshall Islands company that transports iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. Our fleet currently consists of 44 drybulk carriers, including 17 Capesize drybulk carriers, 15 Ultramax drybulk carriers, and twelve Supramax drybulk carriers with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,636,000 deadweight tons dwt ). The average age of our current fleet is approximately 11.0 years. We seek to deploy our vessels on time charters, spot market voyage charters, spot market-related time charters or in vessel pools trading in the spot market, to reputable charterers. The majority of the vessels in our current fleet are presently engaged under time charter, spot market voyage charters and spot market-related time charters that expire (assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised) between February 2023 and February 2024. See pages 5 6 for a table of our current fleet. IMO 2023 Compliance In 2021, Genco initiated a comprehensive plan to comply with upcoming IMO regulations in 2023, namely the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI and the Carbon Intensity Indicator CII metrics, which call for a reduction in vessel greenhouse gas emissions. These metrics are intended to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and these new regulations set required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. We have invested and plan to continue to invest in energy conservation programs to install various energy-saving devices, or ESDs, high performance paint systems, upgrade propellers among other initiatives on select vessels in our fleet. We began installing these ESDs on certain ships that entered drydocking in 2022. These requirements are discussed above under Item 1 - Environmental and Other Regulations Air Emissions. COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization (the WHO declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus strain, or COVID-19, to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Over the course of the pandemic, governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, working from home, supply chain logistical changes, and

 closure of non-essential businesses. This led to a significant slowdown in overall economic activity levels globally and a decline in demand for certain of the raw materials that our vessels transport. Drybulk shipping rates, and therefore our voyage revenues, depend to a significant degree on global economic activity levels and specifically, economic activity in China. As the world s second largest economy, China is the largest importer of drybulk commodities globally, which drives demand for iron ore, coal and other cargoes we carry. In 2022, various regions in China have experienced additional waves of COVID-19 outbreaks for which the government chose to reinstate lockdown measures as part of the country s zero tolerance policy. This has resulted in a reduction in demand for steel products and other commodities we carry, as well as continued disruptions throughout the supply chain. As a result, China s 2022 GDP growth target of around 5.5 was missed as the country s GDP grew by 3 . Towards the end of 2022, the Chinese government began its pivot from its restricted COVID policies, announcing various easing measures as well as support for the property sector. In 2022, our vessel operating expenses continued to be affected by higher than anticipated costs related to COVID-19 disruptions. The impact of COVID-19 on both our revenues and operating expenses remains highly dependent on the trajectory of COVID-19, potential variants, governmental policies as well as vaccine distribution and efficacy, which remains uncertain. The outlook for China and the rest of the world remains uncertain and depends in part on the path of COVID-19 and measures taken by governments around the world in response to it. In 2021, spot rates for Capesize and Supramax vessels reached levels not seen since 2010, and these firm levels, particularly for Supramax vessels, continued into the first half of 2022 despite various seasonal factors. During the second half of 2022, rates declined from highs seen earlier in the year as China s COVID-related lockdown measures intensified. Global vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness, and the onset of variants could impact the sustainability of any recovery in addition to drybulk specific seasonality described in further detail below. As our vessels trade commodities globally, we have taken measures to safeguard our crew and work toward preventing the spread of COVID-19 or any transmittable disease. Genco enacts crew changes where permitted by regulations of the ports and of the country of origin of the mariners, in addition to strict protocols that safeguard our crews against COVID-19 exposure. Crew rotations have been steadily improving as port and travel restrictions globally have reduced. We continue to actively promote the health and safety of both on and off signing crew members. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. IMO 2020 Compliance On October 27, 2016, the Marine Environment Protection Committee MEPC of the International Maritime Organization IMO announced the ratification of regulations mandating reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5 currently to 0.5 as of the beginning of 2020 rather than pushing the deadline back to 2025. Accordingly, ships now have to reduce sulfur emissions, for which the principal solutions are the use of exhaust gas cleaning systems scrubbers or buying fuel with low sulfur content. If a vessel is not retrofitted with a scrubber, it will need to use low sulfur fuel, which is currently more expensive than standard marine fuel containing 3.5 sulfur content. Following an increase in fuel prices during 2021 coming off of 2020 lows, there was a further increase in fuel prices during the first half of 2022 due to oil supply disruptions as a result of the war in Ukraine. The price of fuel began to lower during the second half of 2022 and is expected to continue to decline during 2023. In order to comply with regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5 to 0.5 as of the beginning of 2020, we have installed exhaust gas cleaning systems scrubbers on our 17 Capesize vessels. We will continue to evaluate all options to comply with IMO regulations. Our fuel costs and fuel inventories may increase as a result of these sulfur emission regulations. Low sulfur fuel is more expensive than standard marine fuel containing 3.5 sulfur content and may become more expensive or difficult to obtain as a result of increased demand. If the cost differential between low sulfur fuel and high sulfur fuel is significantly higher than anticipated, or if low sulfur fuel is 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 not available at ports on certain trading routes, it may not be feasible or competitive to operate vessels on certain trading routes without installing scrubbers or without incurring deviation time to obtain compliant fuel. Conversely, if the cost differential between low sulfur fuel and high sulfur fuel is significantly lower than anticipated, or if regulations are passed negatively impacting the use of open-loop scrubbers, we may not realize the economic benefits or recover the cost of the scrubbers we have installed. In addition, a number of countries have imposed restrictions on the discharge of wash water from open loop scrubbers within their port limits. While there are no restrictions on using open loop scrubbers outside of port limits, any changes in these regulations or more stringent standards globally could impact the use of open loop scrubbers going forward. Vessel Sales and Acquisitions On July 2, 2021, we entered into an agreement to purchase two 2017-built, 63,000 dwt Ultramax vessels for a purchase price of 24.6 million each, which were renamed the Genco Mayflower and the Genco Constellation, and one 2014-built, 63,000 dwt Ultramax vessel for a purchase price of 21.9 million, which was renamed the Genco Madeleine. The Genco Mayflower, the Genco Constellation and the Genco Madeleine were delivered on August 24, 2021, September 3, 2021 and August 23, 2021, respectively and we used cash on hand to finance the purchases. On May 18, 2021, we entered into agreements to acquire two 2022-built 61,000 dwt newbuilding Ultramax vessels from Dalian Cosco KHI Ship Engineering Co. Ltd. for a purchase price of 29.2 million each, which were renamed the Genco Mary and the Genco Laddey. The vessels were delivered on January 6, 2022, and we used cash on hand to finance the purchases. On April 20, 2021, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 2016-built, 64,000 dwt Ultramax vessel for a purchase price of 20.2 million, to be renamed the Genco Enterprise. The vessel was delivered on August 23, 2021 and we used cash on hand to finance the purchase. On December 17, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire three modern, eco Ultramax vessels in exchange for six of our older Handysize vessels. The Genco Magic, a 2014-built Ultramax vessel, and the Genco Vigilant and the Genco Freedom, both 2015-built Ultramax vessels, were delivered to the Company on December 23, 2020, January 28, 2021 and February 20, 2021, respectively. We delivered the Genco Ocean, the Baltic Cove and Baltic Fox, all 2010-built Handysize vessels, and the Genco Spirit, the Genco Avra and the Genco Mare, all 2011-built Handysize vessels, on December 29, 2020, January 30, 2021, February 2, 2021, February 15, 2021, February 21, 2021 and February 24, 2021, respectively. During 2021, we completed the sale of five Supramax vessels and six Handysize vessels, which includes five of the Handysize vessels in the exchange described above. We will continue to seek opportunities to renew our fleet going forward.

 (1) Ownership days . We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. (2) Chartered- in days . We define chartered-in days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we chartered-in third party vessels. (3) Available days (owned and chartered-in fleet) . We define available days as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to familiarization upon acquisition, repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (4) Available days (owned fleet) . We define available days for the owned fleet as available days less chartered-in days. (5) Operating days . We define operating days as the number of our total available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (6) Fleet utilization . We calculate fleet utilization as the number of our operating days during a period divided by the number of ownership days plus chartered-in days less drydocking days. (7) Time Charter Equivalent TCE . We define TCE rates as our voyage revenues less voyage expenses, charter-hire expenses, and realized gains or losses on fuel hedges, divided by the number of the available days of our owned fleet during the period. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts.

 (8) Daily vessel operating expenses . We define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance (excluding drydocking), the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.

 (1) EBITDA represents net income attributable to Genco Shipping Trading Limited plus net interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 our consolidated internal financial statements, and it is presented for review at our board meetings. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing. EBITDA presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate our performance prior to these costs. EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e., non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company s operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies. The following table demonstrates our calculation of EBITDA and provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income attributable to Genco Shipping Trading Limited for each of the periods presented above: 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net income attributable to Genco Shipping Trading Limited 158,576 182,007 Net interest expense 8,052 15,203 Income tax expense Depreciation and amortization 60,190 56,231 EBITDA (1) 226,818 253,441 Results of Operations VOYAGE REVENUES- Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of days during which our vessels operate, the type of fixture our vessels are chartered on (spot market voyage charters or fixed rate time charters), and the amount of daily charterhire or freight rates that our vessels earn, that, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including: the duration of our charters; our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals; the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels; the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs; maintenance and upgrade work; the age, condition and specifications of our vessels; levels of supply and demand in the drybulk shipping industry; and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for drybulk carriers. During 2022, voyage revenues decreased by 10.2 million, or 1.9 , to 536.9 million as compared to 547.1 million during 2021. The decrease in voyage revenues was primarily due to lower revenue earned by our major bulk vessels primarily as a result of a decrease in available days due to scheduled drydockings, partially offset by higher rates achieved by our minor bulk vessels. During 2022, the drybulk freight market was firm with the Baltic Capesize Index and the Baltic Supramax Index, as published by the Baltic Exchange, averaging 16,177 and 22,152 per day, respectively. These levels, while strong from a historical perspective, were a decline on a year-over-year basis relative to 2021. This was primarily due to a softening freight rate environment in the second half of 2022 driven by lockdowns in

 China relating to the country s COVID-19 policy, an unwinding of port congestion, lackluster Brazilian iron ore exports, as well as challenges due to macroeconomic conditions as a result of Russia s war in Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine leading to a war and a humanitarian crisis. The impact to date on the drybulk market has been a redirection of cargo flows particularly for coal and grain shipments lengthening ton miles in certain instances. Future developments regarding Russia s war in Ukraine, as well as China in relation to the country s COVID-19 response measures, could continue to affect the drybulk industry and our business in an unpredictable manner. Currently, the freight market is experiencing a seasonally softer period in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of the timing of Chinese New Year, lower cargo shipments due to weather related disruptions and scheduled maintenance in certain export origins as well as the timing of newbuilding vessel deliveries. The average Time Charter Equivalent, or TCE rate of our overall fleet decreased by 2.4 to 23,824 a day during 2022 from 24,402 a day during 2021. The TCE for our major bulk vessels decreased by 17.6 from 27,293 a day during 2021 to 22,492 a day during 2022. This decrease was primarily a result of lower rates achieved by our Capesize vessels. The TCE for our minor bulk vessels increased by 9.8 from 22,397 a day during 2021 to 24,585 a day during 2022 primarily a result of higher rates achieved by our Ultramax and Supramax vessels. For 2022 and 2021, we had ownership days of 16,049.9 days and 15,176.5 days, respectively. The increase in ownership days was due to the delivery of six Ultramax vessels during the second half of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by the sale of eleven Supramax and Handysize vessels during 2021. Fleet utilization decreased from 97.9 during 2021 to 96.5 during 2022 primarily due to additional offhire and repair periods for our Supramax vessels, in addition to scheduled drydocking for some of our Capesize vessels. Please see pages 7 - 8 for a table that sets forth information about the current employment of the vessels in our fleet. Please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of claims regarding the Genco Constellation. VOYAGE EXPENSES- In time charters and spot market-related time charters, operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer. These expenses are borne by the Company during spot market voyage charters. There are certain other non-specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are typically borne by us. Voyage expenses include port and canal charges, fuel (bunker) expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties. Port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on spot market voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner. At the inception of a time charter, we record the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a gain or loss within voyage expenses. Voyage expenses also include the cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters pursuant to the terms of the time charter agreement. Additionally, we may record lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to re-value the bunker fuel on a quarterly basis for certain time charter agreements where the inventory is subject to gains and losses. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Voyage expenses were 153.9 million and 146.2 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher bunker expenses partially offset by a decrease in certain costs incurred related to our spot market voyages. VESSEL OPERATING EXPENSES- Vessel operating expenses increased by 17.4 million from 82.1 million during 2021 to 99.5 million during 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher crew expenses as a result of increased crew wages and the timing of crew changes. Higher repair and maintenance costs on certain vessels, and to a lesser degree, the increase in the purchase 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 of initial stores and spare parts, also contributed to this increase. Higher insurance and lube oil costs also contributed to this increase. We completed the transition of our crews during the second quarter of 2022 which resulted in higher crew expenses during 2022 overall. Additionally, we experienced higher repair and maintenance costs on certain vessels, as well as an increase in the purchase of initial stores and spare parts as we completed the transition of vessels to our new technical management joint venture GSSM during 2022. We have replenished our vessels stores and spare parts after our joint venture took over the technical management of our fleet. Given the foregoing, we expect our operating expenses to stabilize during 2023. Average daily vessel operating expenses DVOE for our fleet increased to 6,197 per vessel per day during 2022 from 5,409 per vessel per day during 2021. The increase in daily vessel operating expenses was primarily due to higher crew related expenses. As we completed the transition of vessels to GSSM through the first half of 2022, higher repair and maintenance costs on certain vessels, and, to a lesser degree, an increase in the purchase of initial stores and spare parts and general inflationary pressures, also contributed to this increase. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. COVID-19 restrictions with regard to crew rotations have previously resulted in increased crew related costs due to travel and port restrictions and could do so in the future. The timing of crew rotations depends on the duration and severity of COVID-19 in countries from which our crews are sourced as well as any restrictions in place at ports in which our vessels call. As a result, crew rotations continue to lead to deviation time of our vessels as well as unbudgeted expenses due to testing, personal protective equipment, quarantine periods, higher than normal travel expenses due to increased airfare costs, and crew bonuses to retain the existing crew during rotation delays. Our vessel operating expenses increase to the extent our fleet expands. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crewing, lubes, and insurance, may also cause these expenses to increase. The impact of COVID-19 could result in potential shortages or a lack of access to required spare parts for the operation of our vessels, potential delays in any unscheduled repairs, deviations for crew changes or increased costs to successfully execute a crew change, which could lead to business disruptions and delays. Crew costs on our vessels could increase in the future due to higher wages, the potential impact of COVID-19 restrictions and the war in Ukraine. Based on estimates provided by GSSM, our DVOE budget for the first quarter of 2023 is 6,250 per vessel per day on a fleet-wide basis, which includes an estimated amount for COVID-19 related expenses. For the full year of 2023, we expect our DVOE budget to be 5,990 per vessel per day. The higher expense levels anticipated during the first quarter of 2023 are primarily due to the timing of crew changes and the purchase of spares and stores. The potential impacts of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine are unpredictable, and the actual amount of our DVOE could be higher or lower than budgeted as a result. CHARTER HIRE EXPENSES- Charter hire expenses decreased by 9.2 million from 36.4 million during 2021 to 27.1 million during 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in chartered-in days during 2022 as compared to 2021. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- We incur general and administrative expenses which relate to our onshore non-vessel-related activities. Our general and administrative expenses include our payroll expenses, including those relating to our executive officers, operating lease expense, legal, auditing and other professional expenses. General and administrative expenses include nonvested stock amortization expense which represents the amortization of stock-based compensation that has been issued to our Directors and employees pursuant to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. Refer to Note 17 Stock-Based Compensation in our Consolidated Financial Statements. General and administrative expenses also include legal and professional fees associated with our credit facilities, which are not capitalizable to deferred financing costs. We also incur general and administrative expenses for our overseas offices located in Singapore and Copenhagen.

Table of Contents 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.3 million from 24.5 million during 2021 to 25.7 million during 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher nonvested stock amortization expense. TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT FEES- Technical management fees include the direct costs incurred by GSSM for the technical management of the vessels under its management. Additionally, prior to the transfer of our vessels to GSSM for technical management, we incurred management fees payable to third party technical management companies for the day-to-day management of our vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Technical management fees were 3.3 million and 5.6 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the savings realized by transferring the management of the vessels in our fleet to GSSM during the second half of 2021 and in 2022. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION- We depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company increased the estimated scrap value of the vessels from 310 per lwt to 400 per lwt prospectively based on the average of the 15-year average scrap value of steel. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 4.0 million from 56.2 million during 2021 to 60.2 million during 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase in drydocking amortization expense for the major and minor bulk vessels that completed their drydockings during 2022. Additionally, there was an increase in the deprecation related to our vessel assets due to the delivery of six Ultramax vessels during the second half of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by a 4.6 million decrease in depreciation due to the increase in the estimated scrap value of the vessels from 310 per lwt to 400 per lwt effective January 1, 2022. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the increase in the scrap value. GAIN ON SALE OF VESSELS- During 2021, we recorded a 4.9 million net gain on sale of vessels related primarily to the sale of the Genco Provence, partially offset by net losses related to the sale of the Baltic Panther, the Baltic Hare, the Baltic Cougar, the Baltic Leopard and the Genco Lorraine, as well as net losses associated with the exchange of the Baltic Cove, the Baltic Fox, the Genco Spirit, the Genco Avra and the Genco Mare. There were no vessel sales during 2022. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)- NET INTEREST EXPENSE- Net interest expense decreased by 7.2 million to 8.1 million during 2022 as compared to 15.2 million during 2021. Net interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of interest expense under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs for those facilities. The decrease was primarily due a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in the average outstanding debt partially offset by higher interest rates. Additionally, the decrease in interest expense was due to settlement payments received for our interest rate cap agreements. Lastly, there was a decrease in the amortization of deferred financing costs due to the refinancing of our credit facilities on August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our credit facilities. LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a 4.4 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the refinancing of our 495 Million Credit Facility and 133 Million Credit Facility with the 450 Million Credit

 Facility on August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our credit facilities. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST During 2022 and 2021, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 0.8 million and 0.04 million, respectively, which is associated with the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest of GSSM, which was formed during September 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, cash on hand, equity offerings and credit facility borrowings. We currently use our funds primarily for the acquisition of vessels, fleet renewal, drydocking for our vessels, payment of dividends, debt repayments and satisfying working capital requirements as may be needed to support our business. Our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs is subject to and will be affected by cash utilized in operations, the economic or business environment in which we operate, shipping industry conditions, the financial condition of our customers, vendors and service providers, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants of our indebtedness, and other factors. We believe, given our current cash holdings, if drybulk shipping rates do not decline significantly from current levels, our capital resources, including cash anticipated to be generated within the year, are sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Such resources include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 58.1 million as of December 31, 2022 in addition to the 212.9 million availability under the revolver of the 450 Million Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, which compares to a minimum liquidity requirement under our credit facility of approximately 22 million as of the date of this report. Given anticipated capital expenditures related to drydockings and the installation of ballast water treatment systems BWTS and fuel efficiency upgrade costs of 12.1 million and 23.4 million during 2023 and 2024, respectively, as well as any quarterly dividend payments, we anticipate to continue to have significant cash expenditures. Refer to Capital Expenditures below for further details. However, if market conditions were to worsen significantly due to COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, or other causes, then our cash resources may decline to a level that may put at risk our ability to pay dividends per our capital allocation strategy or at all. Throughout 2022, the Company made a total of 75.0 million of voluntary debt prepayments, resulting in a reduced cash flow breakeven rate from previous levels. Of that amount, there were four 8.8 million quarterly repayments that represented the previously announced quarterly debt reduction payment as part of our plan to reduce our debt. These amounts were deducted from operating cash flows in each of our quarterly 2022 dividend payment calculation. The remainder of the debt we paid down included 40.0 million which was prepaid to optimize our working capital management, using our revolver to keep funds available while saving interest expense. Currently, there are no mandatory debt repayments until we must repay 171.0 million in 2026. Although we do not have any mandatory debt repayments until 2026, we intend to continue to pay down debt on a voluntary basis with a medium term goal of zero net debt. As of December 31, 2022, the 450 Million Credit Facility contained collateral maintenance covenants that require the aggregate appraised value of collateral vessels to be at least 140 of the principal amount of the loan outstanding under such facility. If the values of our vessels were to decline as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, we may not satisfy this collateral maintenance requirement. If we do not satisfy the collateral maintenance requirement, we will need to post additional collateral or prepay outstanding loans to bring us back into compliance, or we will need to seek waivers, which may not be available or may be subject to conditions. In the future, we may require capital to fund acquisitions or to improve or support our ongoing operations and debt structure, particularly in light of economic conditions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We may from time to time seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt offerings, selling vessels or other assets, pursuing strategic opportunities, or otherwise. We may also from time to time seek to incur additional debt financing from private or public sector sources, refinance our indebtedness or obtain waivers or modifications to our credit agreements to obtain more favorable terms, enhance flexibility in conducting our business, or otherwise. We may also seek to manage our interest rate exposure through hedging transactions. We may seek to accomplish any of these

 independently or in conjunction with one or more of these actions. However, if market conditions are unfavorable, we may be unable to accomplish any of the foregoing on acceptable terms or at all. We entered into the 450 Million Credit Facility on August 3, 2021. Proceeds from the 450 Million Credit Facility were used to refinance our 495 Million Credit Facility and our 133 Million Credit Facility on August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 Debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the terms of the 450 Million Credit Facility, which information is incorporated herein by reference. On November 8, 2022, we entered into an agreement with the lenders under the 450 Million Credit Facility to extend the 360-day period for which we may set aside net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Provence to finance a qualifying replacement vessel until October 28, 2023. Refer to Note 7 Debt. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 450 Million Credit facility. Dividends We disclosed on April 19, 2021 that, on management s recommendation, our Board of Directors adopted a new quarterly dividend policy for dividends payable which commenced in the first quarter of 2022 in respect of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Under the new quarterly dividend policy, the amount available for quarterly dividends is to be calculated based on the following formula: Operating cash flow Less: Debt repayments Less: Capital expenditures for drydocking Less: Reserve Cash flow distributable as dividends The amount of dividends payable under the foregoing formula for each quarter of the year will be determined on a quarterly basis. For purposes of the foregoing calculation, operating cash flow is defined as voyage revenue less voyage expenses, charter hire expenses, vessel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses other than non-cash restricted stock expenses, technical management fees, and interest expense other than non-cash deferred financing costs. Anticipated uses for the reserve include, but are not limited to, vessel acquisitions, debt repayments, and general corporate purposes. In order to set aside funds for these purposes, the reserve will be set on a quarterly basis in the discretion of our Board and is anticipated to be based on future quarterly debt repayments and interest expense. On February 22, 2023, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.50 per share. Our quarterly dividend policy and declaration and payment of dividends are subject to legally available funds, compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations (including our credit facility) and our Board s determination that each declaration and payment is at that time in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders after its review of our financial performance. In connection with our new dividend policy, we have paid down additional indebtedness under our credit facilities and utilized the 450 Million Credit Facility to refinance our two prior credit facilities as noted above. The declaration and payment of any dividend or any stock repurchase is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and management continue to closely monitor market developments together with the evaluation of our quarterly dividend policy in the current market environment. The principal business factors that our Board of Directors expects to consider when determining the timing and amount of dividend payments or stock repurchases include our earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements at the time. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends or stock repurchases other than from surplus. Marshall Islands law also prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends or stock repurchases while a company is insolvent or would be

 rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend or such a stock repurchase. Heightened economic uncertainty and the potential for renewed drybulk market weakness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or the war in Ukraine and related economic conditions may result in our suspension, reduction, or termination of future quarterly dividends. U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Dividends U.S. Holders For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual U.S. citizen or resident, (ii) a corporation that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or any other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if either (x) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. If a partnership, or an entity treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, such as a limited liability company, holds common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in such a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. A beneficial owner of our common stock (other than a partnership) that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to below as a Non-U.S. Holder. Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment company (PFIC) status on pages 35 - 36 of this report, any distributions made by us to a U.S. Holder with respect to our common shares generally will constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of those earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder s tax basis in our common shares (determined on a share-by-share basis), and thereafter as capital gain. U.S. Holders that own at least 10 of our shares may be able to claim a dividends-received-deduction and should consult their tax advisors. Dividends paid on our common shares to a U.S. Holder who is an individual, trust or estate, or a non-corporate U.S. Holder, will generally be treated as qualified dividend income that is taxable to such non-corporate U.S. Holder at preferential tax rates, provided that (1) our common shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE, on which our common shares are traded); (2) we are not a PFIC for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been, are, or will be); (3) the non-corporate U.S. Holder s holding period of our common shares includes more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which our common shares becomes ex-dividend; and (4) the non-corporate U.S. Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. A non-corporate U.S. Holder will be able to take qualified dividend income into account in determining its deductible investment interest (which is generally limited to its net investment income) only if it elects to do so; in such case, the dividend will be taxed at ordinary income rates. Non-corporate U.S. Holders also may be required to pay a 3.8 surtax on all or part of such holder s net investment income, which includes, among other items, dividends on our shares, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this surtax on their ownership of our shares. Amounts taxable as dividends generally will be treated as passive income from sources outside the U.S. However, if (a) we are 50 or more owned, by vote or value, by U.S. Holders and (b) at least 10 of our earnings and profits are attributable to sources within the U.S., then for foreign tax credit purposes, a portion of our dividends would be treated as derived from sources within the U.S. With respect to any dividend paid for any taxable year, the U.S. source ratio of our dividends for foreign tax credit purposes would be equal to the portion of our earnings and profits from sources within the U.S. for such taxable year divided by the total amount of our earnings and profits for such taxable year. The rules related to U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine whether and to what extent a credit would be available. Special rules may apply to any extraordinary dividend generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10 of a shareholder s adjusted basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in a share of our 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 common shares paid by us. If we pay an extraordinary dividend on our common shares that is treated as qualified dividend income , then any loss derived by a non-corporate U.S. Holder from the sale or exchange of such common shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend. Tax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company As discussed in U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders in Item 1.A Risk Factors in this report, a foreign corporation generally will be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, after applying certain look through rules, either (1) at least 75 of its gross income for any taxable year consists of passive income or (2) at least 50 of the average value or adjusted bases of its assets (determined on a quarterly basis) produce or are held for the production of passive income, i.e., passive assets. As discussed above, we do not believe that our past or existing operations would cause, or would have caused, us to be deemed a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. No assurance can be given that the IRS or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year because the PFIC test is an annual test, there are uncertainties in the application of the PFIC rules, and although we intend to manage our business so as to avoid PFIC status to the extent consistent with our other business goals, there could be changes in the nature and extent of our operations in future taxable years. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which a U.S. Holder owns shares of our common stock (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), the tax consequences to such a U.S. holder upon the receipt of distributions in respect of such shares that are treated as excess distributions would differ from those described above. In general, an excess distribution is the amount of distributions received during a taxable year that exceed 125 of the average amount of distributions received by a U.S. Holder in respect of the common shares during the preceding three taxable years, or if shorter, during the U.S. Holder s holding period prior to the taxable year of the distribution. The distributions that are excess distributions would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder s holding period for the common shares. The amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest marginal rate in effect for the U.S. Holder for that taxable year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed on the resulting tax allocated to such other taxable years. The tax liability with respect to the amount allocated to taxable years prior to the year of the distribution cannot be offset by net operating losses. As an alternative to such tax treatment, a U.S. Holder may make a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election, to the extent available, in which event different rules would apply. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder if we were to be classified as a PFIC are complex. A U.S. Holder should consult with his or her own advisor with regard to those consequences, as well as with regard to whether he or she is eligible to and should make either of the elections described above. Non-U.S. Holders Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us on our common shares unless the income is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States effectively connected income (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.). Effectively connected income (or, if an income tax treaty applies, income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the U.S.) generally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax in the same manner discussed above relating to taxation of U.S. Holders. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such income, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30 , or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. Non-U.S. Holders may be subject to tax in jurisdictions other than the United States on dividends received from us on our common shares. Dividends paid on our common shares to a non-corporate U.S. Holder may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding tax if the non-corporate U.S. Holder: fails to provide us with an accurate taxpayer identification number; 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 is notified by the IRS that they have become subject to backup withholding because they previously failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on their federal income tax returns; or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements A holder that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding with respect to such dividends unless the holder certifies that it is a non-U.S. person, under penalties of perjury, or otherwise establishes an exemption therefrom. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Holders generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed their income tax liability by timely filing a refund claim with the IRS. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor concerning the overall tax consequences arising in your own particular situation under U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign law from the payment of dividends on our common stock. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 189.3 million and 231.1 million, respectively. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower revenue earned by our major bulk vessels partially offset by higher rates achieved by our minor bulk vessels, changes in working capital, as well as an increase in drydocking costs incurred. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by lower interest expense. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 55.0 million and 67.6 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a 63.2 million decrease in the purchase of vessels. The purchase of vessels during 2022 is primarily a result of the delivery of two Ultramax vessels that were delivered during the first quarter of 2022, as well as fuel efficiency upgrade vessel asset additions for certain vessels in our fleet. The purchase of vessels during 2021 primarily included the purchase price of four Ultramax vessels which delivered during the third quarter of 2021, as well as deposits made for the two aforementioned Ultramax vessels that delivered during the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a 49.5 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of vessels as there were no vessels sold during 2022. Net cash used in financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 190.7 million and 222.7 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of our prior credit facilities with the 450 Million Credit Facility on August 31, 2021. During 2022, the decrease in total net cash used in financing activities related to our credit facilities was 128.2 million as compared to 2021. Additionally, there was a 6.0 million decrease in deferred financing costs paid in relation to the 450 Million Credit Facility during 2022 as compared to 2021. These decreases were partially offset by a 102.3 million increase in the payment of dividends during 2022 as compared to 2021. Credit Facilities On August 3, 2021, we entered into the 450 Million Credit Facility, which we used to refinance the existing debt outstanding under the 495 Million Credit Facility and the 133 Million Credit Facility as of August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Interest Rate Swap Agreements, Forward Freight Agreements and Currency Swap Agreements At December 31, 2022, we had three interest rate cap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. Such agreements cap the borrowing rate on our variable debt to provide a hedge against the risk of rising rates. At December 31, 2022, the total notional principal amount of the interest rate cap agreements was 200.0 million. 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 Refer to the table in Note 8 Derivative instruments of our Consolidated Financial Statements which summarizes the interest rate cap agreements in place as of December 31, 2022. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. In determining the fair value of interest rate derivatives, we consider the creditworthiness of both the counterparty and ourselves, which has not changed significantly and has no effect on the valuation. Valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk would be validated by comparison with counterparty valuations. Amounts would not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions. Any material differences would be investigated. As part of our business strategy, we may also enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements, or FFAs, to hedge and manage our exposure to the charter market risks relating to the deployment of our vessels. Generally, these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route. Upon settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates (as reported by an identified index) for the specified route and period, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate multiplied by the number of days in the specific period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. Although FFAs can be entered into for a variety of purposes, including for hedging, as an option, for trading or for arbitrage, if we decided to enter into FFAs, our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management. It is not currently our intention to enter into FFAs to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels. If we determine to enter into FFAs, we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns, but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market. We have not entered into any FFAs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Interest Rates The effective interest rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include interest rates associated with the interest expense for our various credit facilities including the following: the 450 Million Credit Facility, as well as the 133 Million Credit Facility and the 495 Million Credit Facility (until these facilities were refinanced with the 450 Million Credit Facility on August 31, 2021). The effective interest rate for the aforementioned credit facilities, including the cost associated with unused commitment fees, if applicable, was 4.63 and 3.22 during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The interest rate on the debt, excluding unused commitment fees, ranged from 2.26 to 6.54 and 2.24 to 3.48 during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital Expenditures We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions. Our fleet currently consists of 44 drybulk vessels, including 17 Capesize drybulk carriers, 15 Ultramax drybulk carriers and twelve Supramax drybulk carriers. As previously announced, we have implemented a fuel efficiency upgrade program for certain of our vessels in an effort to generate fuel savings and increase the future earnings potential for these vessels. The upgrades have been successfully installed during previous drydockings. Under U.S. Federal law and 33 CFR, Part 151, Subpart D, U.S. approved BWTS will be required to be installed in all vessels at the first out of water drydocking after January 1, 2016 if these vessels are to discharge ballast water inside 12 nautical miles of the coast of the U.S. U.S. authorities did not approve ballast water treatment systems until December 2016. Therefore, the U.S. Coast Guard USCG has granted us extensions for our vessels with 2016 drydocking deadlines until January 1, 2018; however, an alternative management system AMS may be installed in lieu. For example, in February 2015, the USCG added Bawat to the list of ballast water treatment systems that received AMS acceptance. An AMS is valid for five years from the date of required compliance with ballast water discharge 
 57

 standards, by which time it must be replaced by an approved system unless the AMS itself achieves approval. Furthermore, we received extensions for vessels drydocking in 2016 that allowed for further extensions to the vessels next scheduled drydockings in year 2021 and 2022. Additionally, for our vessels that were scheduled to drydock in 2017 and 2018, the USCG has granted an extension that enables us to defer installation to the next scheduled out of water drydocking. Any newbuilding vessels that we acquire will have a USCG approved system or at least an AMS installed when the vessel is being built. In addition, on September 8, 2016, the Ballast Water Management BWM Convention was ratified and had an original effective date of September 8, 2017. However, on July 7, 2017, the effective date of the BWM Convention was extended two years to September 8, 2019 for existing ships. This requires vessels to have a BWTS installed to coincide with the vessels next International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate IOPP renewal survey after September 8, 2019. In order for a vessel to trade in U.S. waters, it must be compliant with the installation date as required by the USCG as outlined above. Furthermore, under our comprehensive IMO 2023 compliance plan, we intend to install energy saving devices and apply high performance paint systems in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions among other key initiatives, on select vessels. We plan to undertake most, if not all, of these initiatives while our vessels undergo their regularly scheduled drydocking. These estimated expenditures are included in the table below. During the second half of 2018, we entered into agreements for the purchase of BWTS for 36 of our vessels. During 2022, we completed the installation of BWTS on nine of our vessels. Additionally, during 2020 and 2019, we completed the installation of BWTS on nine and 17 of our vessels, respectively. There were no BWTS installations completed during 2021. Eleven of these vessels have since been sold. We anticipate that we will complete the installation of BWTS on one remaining vessel during the first quarter of 2023. We intend to fund the remaining BWTS purchase price and installation fees using cash on hand. Under maritime regulations that went into effect January 1, 2020, our vessels were required to reduce sulfur emissions, for which the principal solutions are the use of scrubbers or buying fuel with low sulfur content. We have completed the installation of scrubbers on our 17 Capesize vessels, 16 of which were completed as of December 31, 2019 and the last one of which was completed on January 17, 2020. The remainder of our vessels are consuming VLSFO. The costs for the scrubber equipment and installation was capitalized and depreciated over the remainder of the life of the vessel. This does not include any lost revenue associated with offhire days due to the installation of the scrubbers. In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, we will incur additional expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet. Furthermore, we plan to upgrade a portion of our fleet with energy saving devices and apply high performance paint systems in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. We estimate our capitalized drydocking costs, including capitalized costs incurred during drydocking related to vessel assets and vessel equipment, BWTS costs, fuel efficiency upgrades and scheduled off-hire days for our fleet through 2024 to be: 

Year Estimated Drydocking Costs Estimated BWTS Costs Estimated Fuel Efficiency Upgrade Costs Estimated Off-hire Days (U.S. dollars in millions) 2023 8.5 0.2 3.4 204 2024 19.4 4.0 385 The costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash on hand. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses.

 Actual length of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors. Higher repairs and maintenance expenses during drydocking for vessels which are over 15 years old typically result in a higher number of off-hire days depending on the condition of the vessel. During 2022 and 2021, we incurred a total of 25.8 million and 4.9 million of drydocking costs, respectively, excluding costs incurred during drydocking that were capitalized to vessel assets or vessel equipment. We completed the drydockings for 13 of our vessels, of which three began during the further quarter of 2021 and did not complete until the first quarter of 2022. One of our vessels completed part of its drydocking during 2022 and is not expected to complete the entire drydocking requirements until the first quarter of 2023. In addition to this one vessel, we estimate that four of our vessels will be drydocked during 2023 and 13 of our vessels will be drydocked during 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies, because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application. For an additional description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Vessels and Depreciation We record the value of our vessels at their cost (which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage) less accumulated depreciation. We depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, estimated to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value of 400/lwt based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel. Effective January 1, 2022, we increased the estimated scrap value of the vessels from 310 per lwt to 400 per lwt prospectively based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel. This change resulted in a decrease in the annual depreciation charge over the remaining useful life of the vessels. Similarly, an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel would also decrease the annual depreciation charge. Comparatively, a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use. The carrying value of each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels, which could be more or less. Under U.S. GAAP, we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel (excluding its charter) is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired as discussed below under the heading Impairment of long-lived assets. There were no impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Under our credit facility, we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to evidence our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our bank credit facility. Such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such. We were in compliance with the collateral maintenance covenant under

 our 450 Million Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7 Debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We obtained valuations for all of the vessels in our fleet pursuant to the terms of the 450 Million Credit Facility. In the chart below, we list each of our vessels, the year it was built, the year we acquired it, and its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Vessels have been grouped according to their collateralized status as of December 31, 2022 and does not include any vessels held for sale or held for exchange. As of December 31, 2022, the vessel valuations of all of our vessels for covenant compliance purposes under our credit facility as of the most recent compliance testing date were higher than their carrying values as December 31, 2022, with the exception of 16 of our Capesize vessels and one of our Ultramax vessels. As of December 31, 2021, the vessel valuations of all of our vessels for covenant compliance purposes under our credit facility as of the most recent compliance testing date were higher than their carrying values at December 31, 2021, with the exception of eleven of our Capesize vessels. The amount by which the carrying value at December 31, 2022 of 16 of our Capesize vessels and one of our Ultramax vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliances ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from 0.1 million to 11.9 million per vessel, and 130.0 million on an aggregate fleet basis. Comparatively, the amount by which the carrying value at December 31, 2021 of eleven of our Capesize vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliances ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from 4.3 million to 7.0 million per vessel, and 62.7 million on an aggregate fleet basis. The average amount by which the carrying value of these vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes was 7.6 million and 5.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, neither such valuation nor the carrying value in the table below reflects the value of long-term time charters, if any, related to some of our vessels.

 If we were to sell a vessel or hold a vessel for sale, and the carrying value of the vessel were to exceed its fair market value, net of commission, we would record a loss in the amount of the difference. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 Vessel Acquisitions and Dispositions in our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the sale of vessel assets. Deferred drydocking costs Our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every 30 to 60 months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. We defer the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the period between drydockings. Deferred drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard; cost of travel, lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise; and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking. We believe that these criteria are consistent with U.S. GAAP guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of deferral reflects the economics and market values of the vessels. Costs that are not related to drydocking, including routine maintenance and repairs, are expensed as incurred. If the vessel is drydocked earlier than originally anticipated, any remaining deferred drydock costs that have not been amortized are expensed at the end of the drydock. Impairment of long-lived assets We follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ASC 360-10 which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If indicators of impairment are present, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long-lived assets. Although rates have been strong on a relative basis in 2021 and 2022, the drybulk charter market has been volatile in recent years. Shipping rates for key drybulk routes increased during 2021 after a decline in 2020 which was principally as a result of the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates in 2022 continued to exhibit strength, particularly early in the year, before various factors described earlier led to a softening rate environment during the second half of the year. When indicators of impairment are present and our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessel s carrying value, the carrying value is written down, by recording a charge to operations, to the vessel s fair market value if the fair market value is lower than the vessel s carrying value. We determined that as of December 31, 2022, the future income streams expected to be earned by such vessels over their remaining operating lives and upon disposal on an undiscounted basis would be sufficient to recover their carrying values. As of December 31, 2022, only the Capesize and certain of the Ultramax vessels had indicators of impairment and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for those Capesize and Ultramax vessels exceeded each of those vessels carrying values by a margin of approximately 29 to 116 of the carrying value. Our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately 14 years in which to recover sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of December 31, 2022. Management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in the markets in which it participates with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period of time that are utilized in the analyses. In developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, we make assumptions and estimates about the vessels future performance, with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates, fleet utilization, vessels operating expenses, vessels capital expenditures and drydocking requirements, vessels residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel. The assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on historical trends. Specifically, we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters or spot market voyage charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters or spot market voyage charters, we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels unfixed days based on the most recent ten year historical one-year time charter average. In addition, we consider the current market rate environment and, if necessary, adjust our estimates of undiscounted cash 
 62 

Table of Contents 
 flows to reflect the current rate environment. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the future due to changes in current rates which could adversely affect the average rates being utilized and could result in impairment of certain of our older vessels. It is also reasonably possible that vessels that were not subject to impairment testing during 2022 because there was no indicator of impairment could be subject to such testing in the future. Of the inputs that the Company uses for its impairment analysis, future charter rates are the most significant and most volatile. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed by the Company, the Company would record impairment on its vessels for time charter declines from their most recent ten-year historical one-year time charter averages as follows: 

Percentage Decline from Ten-Year Historical One-Year Time Charter Average at Which Point Impairment Would be Recorded As of As of December 31, December 31, Vessel Class 2022 2021 Capesize (18.0) (21.2) Ultramax (1) (9.5) N/A Supramax (2) N/A N/A 

 (1) There were no indicators of impairment for our Ultramax vessels at December 31, 2021 as the respective fair market values of these vessels were higher than their respective carrying values. As such, these vessels were not subject to impairment testing as of December 31, 2021. (2) There were no indicators of impairment for our Supramax vessels as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as the respective fair market values of these vessels were higher than their respective carrying values. As such, these vessels were not subject to impairment testing as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For our impairment analysis, we utilize the ten-year historical one-year time charter average, as well as considering the current rate environment, to project future charter rates, which we believe appropriately takes into account the volatility and highs and lows of the shipping cycle. Our time charter equivalent (TCE) rates for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were above the ten-year historical one-year time charter average as of such dates as follows: 

TCE Rates as Compared with Ten- Year Historical One-Year Time Charter Average (as percentage above) For the Years Ended December 31, Vessel Class 2022 2021 Capesize 37.7 74.9 Ultramax 104.3 88.2 Supramax 98.8 119.9 The projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future voyage revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining life of the vessel, assumed to be 25 years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard, reduced by brokerage and address commissions, expected outflows for vessels maintenance and vessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures) and required capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation, assuming fleet utilization of 98 . The salvage value used in the impairment test is estimated to be 400 per light weight ton, consistent with our vessels depreciation policy discussed above. Although we believe that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. There can be no assurance as to how long charter rates and vessel values will remain at their currently low levels or whether they will improve by any significant degree. Charter rates may remain at

 depressed levels for a prolonged period of time, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, and future assessments of vessel impairment. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest rate risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. Our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flow in relation to our borrowings. We held three interest rate cap agreements as of December 31, 2022 to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. The total notional amount of the caps at December 31, 2022 is 200.0 million and the caps have specified rates and durations. Refer to Note 8 Derivative Instruments of our Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes the interest rate caps in place as of December 31, 2022. The interest rate cap agreements cap the borrowing rate on our variable debt to provide a hedge against the risk of rising rates. The total asset associated with the caps at December 31, 2022 is 6.7 million, of which 6.3 million has been classified as a current asset and 0.4 million has been classified as a noncurrent asset on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI of 6.5 million related to the interest rate cap agreements. At December 31, 2022, 6.1 million of AOCI is expected to be reclassified into income over the next 12 months associated with interest rate derivatives. We are subject to market risks relating to changes in LIBOR rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were subject to the following interest rates on the outstanding debt under our credit facilities (refer to Note 7 Debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements for effective dates and termination dates for our credit facilities outlined below): 450 Million Credit Facility One-month or three-month LIBOR plus 2.45 beginning August 31, 2021, which was reduced to 2.15 effective November 4, 2021. 133 Million Credit Facility 108 Million Tranche one-month LIBOR plus 2.50 until August 31, 2021, when this facility was refinanced with the 450 Million Credit Facility. 25 Million Tranche one-month LIBOR plus 3.0 effective June 15, 2020 when the initial draw down on this facility was made until March 31, 2021, when this tranche was paid down. 495 Million Credit Facility 460 Million Tranche one-month or three-month LIBOR plus 3.25 effective until August 31, 2021, when this facility was refinanced with the 450 Million Credit Facility. 35 Million Tranche one-month LIBOR plus 2.50 effective August 28, 2019 when the initial draw down on this tranche of this facility was made until June 7, 2021, when this tranche was paid down. A 1 increase in LIBOR would have resulted in an increase of 2.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 From time to time, the Company may consider derivative financial instruments such as swaps and caps or other means to protect itself against interest rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we held three interest rate cap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. The total notional amount of the caps at December 31, 2022 is 200.0 million and the caps have specified rates and durations. Refer to Note 8 Derivative Instruments of our Consolidated Financial Statements which summarizes the interest rate caps in place as of December 31, 2022. The three interest rate cap agreements were initially designated and qualified as cash flow hedges. The premium paid is recognized in income on a rational basis, and all changes in the value of the caps are deferred in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into Interest expense in the period when the hedged interest affects earnings. During the second quarter of 2022, based on the total outstanding debt under the 450 Million Credit Facility being below the total notional amount of the interest rate cap agreements, a portion of one of the interest rate cap agreements was dedesignated as a cash flow hedge. Subsequent gains and losses resulting from valuation adjustments on the dedesignated portion of the cap are recorded within interest expense. As the forecasted interest payments hedged are not remote of occurring, the amounts in AOCI as of the date of dedesignation will be released over the remaining original hedge period. Refer to the Interest rate risk section above for further information regarding interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements with the objective of reducing the risk of the effect of changing fuel prices. Our bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, any unrealized or realized gains or losses are recognized as other income (expense). Refer to the Bunker swap and forward fuel purchase agreements section of Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information. Currency and exchange rate risk The majority of transactions in the international shipping industry are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Virtually all of our revenues and most of our operating costs are in U.S. Dollars. We incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, and the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses is immaterial.

 Impairment of Vessel Assets Future Charter Rates Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company s evaluation of vessel assets for impairment involves an initial assessment of each vessel asset to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of the vessel asset may no longer be recoverable. If indicators of impairment exist for a vessel asset, the Company determines the recoverable amount by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the vessel. If the Company s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any vessel asset for which indicators of impairment exist is lower than the vessel asset s carrying value, and the vessel s carrying value is greater than its fair market value, the carrying value is written down, by recording a charge to operations, to the vessel asset s fair market value. The Company makes significant assumptions and judgments to determine the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the remaining useful life of the asset, including estimates and assumptions related to the future charter rates, fleet utilization, vessel operating expenses, vessel capital expenditures and drydocking requirements, vessel residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel. Projected future charter rates are the most significant and volatile assumption that the Company uses for its impairment analysis. Total vessel assets as of December 31, 2022, were 1,002.8 million, with no impairment losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022. We identified future charter rates used in the undiscounted future cash flows analysis as a critical audit matter because of the complex judgments made by management to estimate future charter rates and the significant impact they have on undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the remaining useful life of the vessel. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimate of future charter rates. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the future charter rates utilized in the undiscounted future cash flows included the following, among others: We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s review of the impairment analysis, including the future charter rates used within the undiscounted future cash flows analysis. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company s estimate of future charter rates through the performance of the following procedures: o Evaluated the Company s methodology for estimating the future charter rates which reflect the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time where the vessels are not fixed on time charters or spot market voyage charters, the Company estimates the future daily time charter equivalent for the vessels unfixed days based on the most recent ten-year historical one-year time charter average for the vessel class, as well as also considering the current rate environment, to project future charter rates. o Compared the future charter rates utilized in the undiscounted future cash flow analysis to 1) the Company s historical rates, 2) historical rate information by vessel class published by third parties and 3) other external market sources, including analysts reports and freight forward agreement curves. o Obtained from the Company s management the assumptions used in the future charter rates and considered the consistency of the assumptions used with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. This included 1) internal communications by management to the board of directors and 2) external communications by management to analysts and investors.

 Genco Shipping Trading Limited (U.S. Dollars in Thousands, Except per Share Data) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 by the Company and by Synergy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and was formed to provide ship management services to the Company s vessels. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the cumulative investments GSSM received from the Company and Synergy totaled and , respectively, which were used for expenditures directly related to the operations of GSSM. Management has determined that GSSM qualifies as a variable interest entity, and, when aggregating the variable interest held by the Company and Synergy, the Company is the primary beneficiary as the Company has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact GSSM s economic performance. Accordingly, the Company consolidates GSSM. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus strain, or COVID-19, to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Over the course of the pandemic, governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, working from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. This led to a significant slowdown in overall economic activity levels globally and a decline in demand for certain of the raw materials that our vessels transport. At present, it is not possible to ascertain any future impact of COVID-19 on the Company s operational and financial performance. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors the Company cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, the carrying value of the Company s assets, the fair values of the Company s vessels, and the Company s ability to pay dividends. Other General Information As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company s fleet consisted of , and vessels, respectively.

Depreciation expense is calculated based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value. The costs of significant replacements, renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the vessel s remaining estimated useful life or the estimated life of the renewal or betterment. Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Scrap value is estimated by the Company by taking the cost of steel times the weight of the ship noted in lightweight tons lwt ). Effective January 1, 2022, the Company increased the estimated scrap value of the vessels from per lwt to per lwt prospectively based on the average of the 15-year average scrap value of steel. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in the estimated scrap value resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of . The decrease in depreciation expense resulted in a increase to the basic and diluted net earnings per share during the year ended December 31, 2022. The basic and diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been per share and per share, respectively, if there were no change in the estimated scrap value. to for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. The Company defers the costs associated with the drydockings as they occur and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis over the period between drydockings. Costs deferred as part of a vessel s drydocking include actual costs incurred at the drydocking yard; cost of travel, lodging and subsistence of personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise; and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking. If the vessel is drydocked earlier than originally anticipated, any remaining deferred drydock costs that have not been amortized are expensed at the end of the drydock. Amortization expense for drydocking for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was , and , respectively, and is included in Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded related to the impairment of vessel assets in accordance with ASC 360. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long-lived assets. When the Company performs its analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows, the Company utilizes various assumptions based on historical trends. Specifically, the Company utilizes the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters or spot market voyage charters, without assuming additional profit sharing. For periods of time during which the Company s vessels are not fixed on time charters or spot market voyage charters, the Company utilizes an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the vessels unfixed days based on the most recent historical time charter average. In addition, the Company considers the current market rate environment and, if necessary, will adjust its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows to reflect the current rate environment. The projected undiscounted future net cash flows are determined by considering the future voyage revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining life of the vessel, assumed to be from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard, reduced by brokerage and address commissions, expected outflows for vessels maintenance and vessel operating expenses (including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures) and required capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation, assuming fleet utilization of . The salvage value used in the impairment test is estimated to be per light weight ton, consistent with the Company s depreciation policy during 2022.

Additionally, on January 25, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Baltic Leopard, a 2009-built Supramax vessel, to a third party for less a commission payable to a third party. As the undiscounted cash flows, including the net sales price, did not exceed the net book value of the Genco Lorraine and the Baltic Leopard as of December 31, 2020, the vessels values for the Genco Lorraine and the Baltic Leopard were adjusted to their net sales prices of and as of December 31, 2020, respectively. This resulted in an impairment loss of and for the Genco Lorraine and the Baltic Leopard, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020.

If the Company does not qualify for the Section 883 exemption, the Company s U.S. source shipping income, i.e., of its gross shipping income attributable to transportation beginning or ending in the U.S. (but not both beginning and ending in the U.S.) is subject to a tax without allowance for deductions (the U.S. gross transportation tax ). During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company qualified for Section 883 exemption and, therefore, did not record any U.S. gross transportation tax. rate. In addition, the Company may be subject to a branch profits tax on such income, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of such trade or business. Shipping income is generally sourced to the United States if attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports (the Company is prohibited from conducting such voyages), to the United States if attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but does not both begin and end, in the United States (as described in United States Gross Transportation Tax above) and otherwise to the United States. The Company s U.S. source shipping income would be considered effectively connected income only if: the Company has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income; and substantially all of the Company s U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S. The Company does not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any vessel sailing to or from the U.S. on a regularly scheduled basis. Based on the current shipping operations of the Company and the Company s expected future shipping operations and other activities, the Company believes that none of its U.S. source shipping income will constitute effectively connected income. However, the Company may from time to time generate non-shipping income that may be treated as effectively connected income. The Company established Genco Shipping Pte. Ltd. GSPL ), which is based in Singapore, on September 8, 2017.

The award is for an initial period of , commencing on August 15, 2018, and is subject to a review of performance at the end of the initial period. The MSI-ASI status provides for a tax exemption on income derived by GSPL from qualifying shipping operations under Section 13F of the SITA. Income from non-qualifying activities is taxable at the prevailing Singapore Corporate income tax rate (currently ). During the year ended December 31, 2022, GSPL recorded of income tax in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 - interest rate cap agreements outstanding to manage interest costs and the risk associated with variable interest rates. The interest rate cap agreements were initially designated and qualified as cash flow hedges. The premium paid is recognized in income on a rational basis, and all changes in the value of the caps are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into Interest expense in the period when the hedged interest affects earnings. During the second quarter of 2022, based on the total outstanding debt under the 450 Million Credit Facility being below the total notional amount of the interest rate cap agreements, a portion of one of the interest rate cap agreements was dedesignated as a hedge. Subsequent gains and losses resulting from valuation adjustments on the dedesignated portion of the cap are recorded within interest expense. As the forecasted interest payments hedged are not remote of occurring, the amounts in AOCI as of the date of dedesignation will be recognized over the remaining original hedge period.

The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the interest rate derivatives using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted) reflecting current market expectations about those future amounts. Level 2 inputs for derivative valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR cash and swap rates, implied volatility, basis swap adjustments, and credit risk at commonly quoted intervals). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for most fair value measurements. The Company recorded a gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 in AOCI.

Refer to Note 7 Debt for further information regarding the Company s credit facility. The carrying amounts of the Company s other financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (principally Due from charterers and Accounts payable and accrued expenses) approximate fair values because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements Disclosures ASC 820-10 ), applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. This guidance enables the reader of the consolidated financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are considered Level 1 items, as they represent liquid assets with short-term maturities. Floating rate debt is considered to be a Level 2 item, as the Company considers the estimate of rates it could obtain for similar debt or based upon transactions amongst third parties. Interest rate cap agreements, bunker swap agreements and forward fuel purchase agreements are considered to be Level 2 items. Refer to Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, respectively, for further information. Nonrecurring fair value measurements include vessel impairment assessments completed during the interim period and at year-end as determined based on third-party quotes, which are based on various data points, including comparable sales of similar vessels, which are Level 2 inputs. There was vessel impairment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the vessels assets for of the Company s vessels were written down as part of the impairment recorded during that period. Refer to Impairment of long-lived assets section in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The fair value determination for the operating lease right-of-use assets was based on third party quotes, which is considered a Level 2 input.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, our management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report is included on pages 67 68 of this report. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Grant of Restricted Stock Units . Pursuant to, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth herein (including without limitation Section 17 hereof) and in the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Participant 112,540 restricted stock units (the Restricted Stock Units ).

 3. Incorporation of Plan . All terms, conditions and restrictions of the Plan are incorporated herein and made part hereof as if stated herein.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Plan. 
 
 1. Vesting . 
 
 (a) Subject to Section 4(b) and Section 6 hereof and the further provisions of this Agreement, 1/5 of the total number of Restricted Stock Units shall vest on each of the first five anniversaries of February 23, 2023 (each such date, a Vesting Date ), in each case subject to the Participant s continued service with the Company on the applicable Vesting Date. (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Restricted Stock Units shall become vested in full on the date six months after the date of such Change in Control (to the extent not previously vested in accordance with Section 4(a), Section 6(b), (c), or (d)), subject to the Participant s continued service with the Company on the vesting date; provided, however, that if (i) this award is not assumed, continued or substituted for an equivalent award by the acquirer in such Change in Control or (ii) the Participant s employment is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Plan) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) at a time when the Company is a party to a definitive business combination transaction agreement, the consummation of which would result in a Change in Control, then the Restricted Stock Units shall become vested in full upon the consummation of the Change in Control or at the time of such

For purposes hereof, Service means a continuous time period during which the Participant is at least one of the following: an employee or a director of, or a consultant to, the Company. (b) In the event that, before all the Restricted Stock Units are vested, the Participant s Service as an employee of the Company is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Plan) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), within twelve (12) months after completion of any merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar event of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as a result of which (A) if the Company is the surviving entity, the Company issues securities representing more than thirty-five percent (35 of the voting power of the voting securities of the Company prior to such transaction or (B) if the Company is not the surviving entity, the holders of the voting stock of the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar event do not directly or indirectly hold at least sixty-five percent (65 of the aggregate voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity, then the Restricted Stock Units shall become vested in full. For the avoidance of doubt, no resignation by the Participant as a director following termination of the Participant s employment by the Company without cause shall be deemed a resignation by the Participant subject to Section 6(a). (c) In the event that, before all the Restricted Stock Units are vested, the Participant s Service with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the Plan) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), then subject to Sections 4(b)(ii) and 6(b) hereof, the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested on the Vesting Date immediately following the date of such termination shall vest as of the date of such termination of Service, and any remaining unvested Restricted Stock Units, together with any Dividend Equivalents related to such Restricted Stock Units, as set forth in Section 9 hereof, shall be forfeited as of the date such Service terminates. In the event that, before all the Restricted Stock Units are vested, the Participant s Service with the Company terminates for reason of the Participant s death or disability (as defined in the Plan), a Pro Rata Portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall become vested as of the date such Service terminates in addition to the portion of the Restricted Stock Units which have already become vested as of such date, and all other Restricted Stock Units which are not and have not become vested, together with any Dividend Equivalents related to such Restricted Stock Units, as set forth in Section 9 hereof, shall be forfeited as of the date such Service terminates. For purposes hereof, Pro Rata Portion shall mean that number of Restricted Stock Units that would become vested on the next Vesting Date multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 12 and the numerator of which is the 
 2 

number of completed months (measured from the day of the month of the Vesting Date to the same day of the following month) between the immediately preceding Vesting Date (or the Grant Date if there is no preceding Vesting Date) and the date of termination of Service. 4. Settlement . 
 
 (a) All vested Restricted Stock Units shall be settled within 30 days following the applicable vesting date by the Company s issuance and delivery to the Participant of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of vested Restricted Stock Units or, in the discretion of the Administrator, by the payment of an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (with Fair Market Value determined as of the applicable date of vesting). (b) Notwithstanding the above, if the Participant is subject to any Company blackout policy or other trading restriction imposed by the Company on the date such distribution would otherwise be made pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof and the shares in such distribution are not subject to a trading plan to which the Recipient and the Company are parties adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, amended, pursuant to which at least a sufficient number of such shares are to be sold at the time of such distribution to cover the Participant s tax obligations with respect to such distribution, such distribution shall instead be made on the earlier of (i) the date that the Participant is not subject to any such policy or restriction and (ii) the later of (1) the last business day of the calendar year in which the vesting in respect of such distribution occurred and (2) the 90th day after the date of the vesting in respect of such distribution (or, if such 90th day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day). (c) The Participant shall not be deemed for any purpose to be, or have rights as, a shareholder of the Company by virtue of the grant of Restricted Stock Units, unless and until shares of Common Stock are issued to the Participant in respect of such Restricted Stock Units. 5. Securities Matters . The Company shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act of any interests in the Plan or any shares of Common Stock to be issued thereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state laws. The Company shall not be obligated to cause to be issued any shares, whether by means of stock certificates or appropriate book entries, unless and until the Company is advised by its counsel that the issuance of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Common Stock are traded. The Administrator may require, as a condition of the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such covenants, agreements and representations, and that any certificates bear such legends and any book entries be subject to such electronic coding, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable. The Participant specifically understands and agrees that the shares of Common Stock, if and when issued, may be restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the 1933 Act and, accordingly, the Participant may be required to hold the shares indefinitely unless they are registered under such Act or an exemption from such registration is available. 
 6. Dividend Equivalents . Notwithstanding anything herein, each Restricted Stock Unit granted hereunder is hereby granted in tandem with a corresponding dividend equivalent applicable to all types of dividends, whether extraordinary, ordinary, in cash, stock, or other property (a Dividend Equivalent ), which Dividend Equivalent shall remain outstanding from the Grant Date until the earlier of the settlement or forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Unit to which it corresponds. If a Restricted Stock Unit is forfeited, the corresponding Dividend Equivalent shall be forfeited as well.
