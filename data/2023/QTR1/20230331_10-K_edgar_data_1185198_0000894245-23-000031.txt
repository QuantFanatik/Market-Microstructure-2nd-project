PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

AEI Income Growth Fund 25 LLC (the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a limited liability company which was organized pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24, 2002. The registrant is comprised of AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. AFM ), as the Managing Member, Robert P. Johnson, the Chief Executive Officer and sole director of AFM, as the Special Managing Member until his withdrawal date effective March 31, 2020, and purchasers of LLC Units as Limited Members. The Company offered for sale up to 50,000,000 of limited membership interests (the "Units") (50,000 Units at 1,000 per Unit) pursuant to a registration statement effective May 13, 2003. The Company commenced operations on September 11, 2003 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units 1,500,000) were accepted. The offering terminated May 12, 2005 when the extended offering period ended. The Company received subscriptions for 42,434.763 LLC Units. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Limited Members and Managing Members contributed funds of 42,434,763 and 1,000, respectively. 

The Company was organized to acquire existing and newly constructed commercial properties, to lease such properties to tenants under net leases, to hold such properties and to eventually sell such properties. From subscription proceeds, the Company purchased fifteen properties, including partial interests in eight properties, at a total cost of 36,389,018. The balance of the subscription proceeds was applied to organization and syndication costs. The properties are commercial, single tenant buildings leased under net leases. 

The Company's properties were purchased without any indebtedness. The Company will not finance properties in the future to obtain proceeds for new property acquisitions. If it is required to do so, the Company may incur short-term indebtedness to finance day-to-day cash flow requirements (including cash flow necessary to repurchase Units). The Company may borrow to finance the refurbishing of a property. 

The Company will hold its properties until the Managing Members determine that the sale or other disposition of the properties is advantageous in view of the Company's investment objectives. In deciding whether to sell properties, the Managing Members will consider factors such as potential appreciation, net cash flow and income tax considerations. The Company expects to sell some or all of its properties prior to its final liquidation and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in additional properties. The Company reserves the right, at the discretion of the Managing Members, to either distribute proceeds from the sale of properties to the Members or to reinvest such proceeds in additional properties, provided that sufficient proceeds are distributed to the Limited Members to pay federal and state income taxes related to any taxable gain recognized as a result of the sale. 

In June 2022, the Managing Member mailed a Consent Statement (Proxy) seeking the consent of the Limited Members to continue the Company for an additional 60 months or to initiate the final disposition, liquidation, and distribution of all of the Company s properties and assets. Approval of either proposal required the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding units. On August 24, 2022, the votes were counted and neither proposal received the required majority vote. As a result, the Company will not liquidate and will continue in operation until the Limited Members vote to authorize the sale of all the Company s properties or December 31, 2053, as stated in the Operating Agreement. However, in approximately five years, the Managing Member expects to again submit the question to liquidate to a vote by the Limited Members.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. (Continued) 

Leases 

Although there are variations in the specific terms of the leases, the following is a summary of the general terms of the Company's leases. The properties are leased to tenants under net leases, classified as operating leases. Under a net lease, the tenant is responsible for real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and operating expenses for the property. For some leases, the Company is responsible for repairs to the structural components of the building, the roof, and the parking lot. At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining primary lease terms varied from 10 to 20 years, except for the Staples store in Clermont, Florida, which had a remaining primary term of 8.4 years, and the Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana, which had a remaining primary term of 7.8 years. The leases provide the tenants with one to five five-year renewal options subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term. The leases provide for base annual rental payments, payable in monthly installments, and contain rent clauses which entitle the Company to receive additional rent in future years based on stated rent increases. 

Property Activity During the Last Three Years 

As of December 31, 2019, the Company owned interests in eleven properties with a total cost of 25,860,646. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2022, the Company expended 3,577,805 and 1,052,919 to purchase three additional property interests as it reinvested cash generated from property sales. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2022, the Company sold four property interests and received net sale proceeds of 681,729, and 1,959,687, which resulted in net gains of 165,255 and 528,892, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned interests in ten properties with a total cost of 27,323,733. 

Major Tenants 

During 2022, four tenants contributed more than ten percent of the Company's total rental income. The major tenants in aggregate contributed 83 of total rental income in 2022. It is anticipated that, based on the minimum rental payments required under the leases, each major tenant will continue to contribute more than ten percent of rental income in 2023. Any failure of a major tenant could materially affect the Company's net income and cash distributions. 

Competition 

The Company is a minor factor in the commercial real estate business. There are numerous entities engaged in the commercial real estate business which have greater financial resources than the Company. At the time the Company elects to dispose of its properties, it will be in competition with other persons and entities to find buyers for its properties.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. (Continued) 

Employees 

The Company has no direct employees. Management services are performed for the Company by AEI Fund Management, Inc. (Management Company), an affiliate of AFM. For the past two fiscal years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management Company has not made any reductions to employee headcount, compensation plans, or employee benefit plans. 

The Management Company believes the people who work for the company are its most important resources and are critical to its continued success. The Management Company focuses significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support its operations. The Management Company s people are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of the Management Company s employees must adhere to a code of conduct that is outlined in AEI s employee handbook which sets standards for appropriate behavior which includes preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination. 

Compensation and Benefits 

The Management Company believes its compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in its industry. In addition to base pay, all eligible employees participate in the Management Company bonus program. The Management Company also offers employees a broad range of benefits, including medical, dental and ancillary health benefits and paid parental leave. 

Workplace Safety and Wellness 

The safety and well-being of the Management Company s employees is its priority. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management Company implemented a COVID-19 Preparedness Plan which included safety protocols to assist in mitigating the risk of exposure to its employees and visitors. These protocols include complying with health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. Many of the Management Company s operational functions during this time have required modification, including most of its employees working remotely. The Management Company s experienced teams of people adapted to the changes in the work environment and have managed business successfully during this challenging time.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 

Investment Objectives 

The Company's investment objectives are to acquire existing or newly-developed commercial properties that provide (i) regular rental income; (ii) growth in lease income through rent escalation provisions; (iii) capital growth through appreciation in the value of properties; (iv) reduced occupancy risks as a result of long-term leases with creditworthy corporate tenants; and (v) passive income that may be offset by eligible passive losses from other investments for tax purposes. The Company does not have a policy, and there is no limitation, as to the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in any one property. However, to the extent possible, the Managing Members attempt to diversify the properties by tenant and geographic location. 

Description of Properties 

The Company's properties are commercial, single tenant buildings. The properties were acquired on a debt-free basis and are leased to tenants under net leases, classified as operating leases. The Company holds an undivided fee simple interest in the properties. 

The Company's properties are subject to the general competitive conditions incident to the ownership of single tenant investment real estate. Since each property is leased under a longterm lease, there is little competition until the Company decides to sell the property. At this time, the Company will be competing with other real estate owners, on both a national and local level, in attempting to find buyers for the properties. In the event of a tenant default, the Company would be competing with other real estate owners, who have property vacancies, to attract a new tenant to lease the property. The Company's tenants operate in industries that are competitive and can be affected by factors such as changes in regional or local economies, seasonality and changes in consumer preference.

(3) This property is vacant and listed for lease. 

The properties listed above with a partial ownership percentage are owned with the following affiliated entities: Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan (AEI Income Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership); property in Wichita, Kansas (AEI Income Growth Fund 26 LLC); Advance Auto Parts store in Indianapolis, Indiana (AEI Income Growth Fund XXII Limited Partnership); and Talecris Plasma Facility in Dallas, Texas (AEI Income Growth Fund XXII Limited Partnership). 

The Company accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-common with affiliated entities and/or unrelated third parties using the proportionate consolidation method. Each tenant-in-common owns a separate, undivided interest in the properties. Any tenant-in-common that holds more than a 50 interest does not control decisions over the other tenant-in-common interests. The financial statements reflect only this Company s percentage share of the properties land, building, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 

At the time the properties were acquired, the remaining primary lease terms varied from 7.8 to 20 years. The leases provide the tenants with one to five five-year renewal options subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term, except for the Talecris Plasma Facility in Dallas, Texas which has one ten-year renewal option. The leases for the Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan, Jared Jewelry store in Aurora, Illinois, Advance Auto Parts store in Indianapolis, Indiana, and PetSmart Store in Gonzales, Louisana were extended to end on December 31, 2024, April 30, 2025, April 30, 2025, and January 31, 2028 respectively.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. (Continued) 

Pursuant to the lease agreements, the tenants are required to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage on the properties they occupy. The Managing Members believe the properties are adequately covered by insurance and consider the properties to be well-maintained and sufficient for the Company's operations. 

For tax purposes, the Company's properties are depreciated under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The largest depreciable component of a property is the building which is depreciated using the straight-line method over 39 years. The remaining depreciable component of a property is land improvements which are depreciated using an accelerated method over 15 years. Since the Company has tax-exempt Members, the Company is subject to the rules of Section 168(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code which requires a percentage of the properties' depreciable components to be depreciated over longer lives using the straight-line method. In general, the federal tax basis of the properties for tax depreciation purposes equals the book depreciable cost of the properties plus the amortizable cost of the related intangible lease assets, except for properties whose carrying value was reduced by a real estate impairment and properties purchased during 2009 through 2017. Real estate impairments, which are recorded against the book cost of the land and depreciable property, are not recognized for tax purposes. For properties purchased during 2009 through 2017, acquisition expenses that were expensed for book purposes were capitalized and added to the basis of the property for tax depreciation purposes. 

At December 31, 2022, all properties listed above were 100 occupied. The only exceptions are the property in Wichita, Kansas that is 28 occupied and the property in Terre Haute, Indiana that is vacant.

Distributions of 34,342 and 42,155 were declared to the Managing Members and 1,110,383 and 1,362,997 were declared to the Limited Members for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The distributions were made on a quarterly basis and represented Net Cash Flow, as defined, except as discussed below. These distributions should not be compared with dividends paid on capital stock by corporations. 

(b) Not applicable. 

(c) Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Operating Agreement, each Limited Member has the right to present Units to the Company for purchase by submitting notice to the Managing Member during January or July of each year. The purchase price of the Units is equal to 80 of the net asset value per Unit, as of the first business day of January or July of each year, as determined by the Managing Member in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Agreement. Units tendered to the Company during January and July may be repurchased on April 1st and October 1st, respectively, of each year subject to the following limitations. The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company. During the last three months of 2022, the Company did not purchase any Units. 

Other Information 

Effective April 11, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA implemented Rule 2310, a revised rule that requires securities broker-dealers to report on customer account statements the value of investment units of non-traded securities, such as REITs, LLCs and Limited Partnerships, provided that the per unit value is derived using methodology set forth by the rule. 

At December 31, 2022, the estimated value of the Company s Units was 728 per Unit. The Managing Member is the party responsible for the estimated value per Unit. The estimated value was derived using methodology that conforms to standard industry practice and based upon material assistance and/or confirmation by third-party valuation expert(s), in accordance with the appraised value method set forth in FINRA Rule 2340(c)(1)(B). 

In determining the estimated value of each property, the Managing Member relied on some or all of the following external information sources, as well as its own experience in the commercial, net leased property industry and knowledge of each property: 

Opinions of value from real estate brokerage firms 

Appraisal reports from independent commercial property appraisers 

Industry market reports from real estate brokerage and appraisal firms 

Market values from comparable properties listed for sale or recently sold 

Interviews with real estate brokers and tenants 

Tenant financial reports and other credit information, where available

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK- 

HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. 

The per Unit value was the aggregate estimated value of the Company's assets less the Company's liabilities, and less the value attributable to the interest of the Managing Members, divided by the number of Units outstanding. The Company's cash, receivables and liabilities were valued at face value as of September, 30 2022. Each of the Company's properties were valued by dividing their annual rental income as of December 1, 2022 by a capitalization rate the Managing Member believed, based upon the aforementioned valuation process, to be representative of the retail market for the sale of each property. The resulting value for each property was reviewed to determine that it also reflected circumstances that may have been unique to each specific property. For recently acquired properties, an appraisal report received at or near the time of acquisition from an independent commercial property appraiser was used to determine the value of the property. The appraisal report is used to value the property for approximately one year after the date of acquisition. The valuations were estimates only, and were based on a number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete. In addition, property values are subject to change and could decline after the date of the valuations. Accordingly, this estimated value should not be viewed as the amount at which a Limited Member may be able to sell his units, or the fair market value of the Company properties, nor does it represent the amount of net proceeds Limited Members would receive if the Company properties were sold and the proceeds distributed in a liquidation of the Company. 

The following table provides a breakdown of each major asset type, liabilities and the number of Units that were used to calculate the estimated value per Unit, using the methodology described above, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for Members; 

resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the Managing Members of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Company operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Company s assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. It is possible that the carrying amount of the Company s assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. 

Management of the Company evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the Managing Member of the Company. 

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties 

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Company records them in the financial statements at cost. The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the relative fair value of each component of the property. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management s assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset. 

10

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods. The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. Below market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income. 

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management s consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed. 

The determination of the relative fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables. If management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income. 

Carrying Value of Properties 

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value. For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties. 

11

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Allocation of Expenses 

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund s affairs. They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund s operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund s capitalization relative to other funds they manage. The Company reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating Agreement. 

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 

The Company is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues and investment property value. However, due to the current economic factors, higher interest rates, and inflation in the U.S. and globally, our tenants and operating partners may be impacted. 

Results of Operations 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized rental income of 1,628,511 and 1,743,816, respectively. In 2022, rental income decreased due to the sale of one property and the vacancy of one property in 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a rent increase on two properties. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned as of February 28, 2023, the Company expects to recognize rental income of approximately 1,687,000 in 2023. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated parties of 267,330 and 239,334, respectively. These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Members. During the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of 197,260 and 197,858, respectively. These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs. These expenses were higher in 2022, when compared to 2021, mainly due to expenses related to the Wichita, Kansas and Terre Haute, Indiana stores.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

The Company owned a 60 interest in a former Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas. On March 2, 2016, the tenant, TSA Stores, Inc., and its parent company, The Sports Authority, Inc., the guarantor of the lease, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. In June 2016, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease for this store effective June 30, 2016, at which time the tenant returned possession of the property to the owners. As of December 31, 2020, the tenant owed 29,049 of past due rent, which was not recorded for financial reporting purposes. On March 23, 2021, a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case was issued by a federal judge to The Sports Authority, Inc., the Company will therefore not be receiving any of the past due rent. The owners listed the property for lease with a real estate broker in the Wichita area. While the property was vacant, the Company was responsible for its 60 share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property. 

On September 21, 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a primary term of 10 years with Biomat USA, Inc. Biomat as a replacement tenant for 28 of the square footage of the property. The tenant operates a Biomat USA Plasma Center in the space. The Company s 60 share of annual rent, which commenced on June 18, 2018, is 55,607. Biomat agreed to pay for the costs to divide the building into two separate spaces, the costs of tenant improvements to remodel the Biomat space and 28 of the cost to replace the roof. 

On August 27, 2019, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a primary term of 10 years with BigTime Fun Center, LLC as a replacement tenant for 57 of the square footage of the property. The tenant was to operate an indoor sports entertainment center in the space. The Company s 60 share of annual rent, which was to commence on February 23, 2020, is 117,000. As part of the agreement, the Company was to pay a tenant improvement allowance of 96,000 when certain conditions were met by the tenant. Due to ongoing difficulties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was negotiating a rent commencement date of April 1, 2021. As a part of the negotiations, the tenant improvement allowance was to be replaced with a ten month rent abatement starting April 1, 2021. Additionally, this agreement would forebear rent and additional charges for the period from February 23, 2020 to March 31, 2021. In September 2019, the Company paid 49,140 to a real estate broker for its 60 share of the lease commission due as part of the lease transaction. This amount was capitalized and was to be amortized over the term of the lease. On January 22, 2021 the owner of Big Time Fun Center, LLC informed the Company it did not intend to open the Wichita property. As a result of the tenant informing the Company of their intention not to open, the full amount of the lease commission was amortized in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

In September 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 60 interest in the Biomat medical center in Wichita, Kansas to an unrelated third party. The property was classified as real estate held for sale at December 31, 2022. On February 9, 2023, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of 1,415,366, which resulted in a net gain of 41,419. At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 2,839,297 and 1,465,350, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

The Company owns a 100 interest in a Premier Diagnostic Imaging Center in Terre Haute, Indiana. On May 31, 2022, the lease term ended, and the tenant returned possession of the property to the owners. While the property is vacant, the Company is responsible for its 100 share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property. The owners have listed the property for lease with a real estate broker in the Terre Haute area. The annual rent from this property represented approximately 12 of the total annual rent of the Company s property portfolio. The loss of rent and increased expenses related to this property decreased the Company s cash flow. However, at this time, the Company does not anticipate the need to reduce its regular quarterly cash distribution. 

In October 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the tenant of the PetSmart store in Gonzales, Louisiana to extend the lease term five years to end on January 31, 2028. As part of the agreement, the annual rent increased from 246,179 to 258,336 effective February 1, 2023. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized interest income of 12,077 and 436, respectively. In 2022, interest income increased due to the Company having more money invested in a money market account and higher money market interest rates in 2022. 

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's cash balances increased 1,106,164 as a result of cash generated from operating activities due to proceeds received from the sale of real estate and cash generated from operating activities in excess of distributions paid to the Members, which was partially offset by cash used to purchase property. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company's cash balances decreased 46,344 primarily as a result of distributions paid to the Members in excess of cash generated from operating activities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 1,489,022 in 2021 to 1,344,121 in 2022 as a result of a decrease in total rental income, an increase in LLC administration and property management expenses and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses in 2022, which was partially offset by an increase in interest income in 2022. 

The major components of the Company's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of 1,959,687. During the same period, the Company expended 1,052,919 to invest in real properties as the Company reinvested cash generated from property sales. 

14

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

In June 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 72 interest in the Staples store in Clermont, Florida to an unrelated third party. On June 30, 2022, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of 1,959,687, which resulted in a net gain of 528,892. At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was 2,315,045 and 884,250, respectively. 

On November 1, 2022, the Company purchased an additional 50 interest in the Coliseum Health store in Macon, Georgia for 1,052,919 from AEI Income Growth Fund 24 LLC Fund 24 ), an affiliate of the Company. The purchase price of the property interest was based upon the property s fair market value as determined by an independent, third-party, commercial property appraiser. The property interest became available because Fund 24 is in the process of liquidating its property portfolio. The Company now owns 100 of the Coliseum Health property. The Company allocated 22,002 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles. The annual rent for the additional 50 interest that was purchased is 84,474. 

The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Members and cash used to repurchase Units. The Company declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter. The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter. The Company may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company declared distributions of 1,144,725 and 1,405,152, respectively. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97 to the Limited Members and 3 to the Managing Members. Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale were allocated 99 to the Limited Members and 1 to the Managing Members. The Limited Members received distributions of 1,110,383 and 1,362,997 and the Managing Members received distributions of 34,342 and 42,155 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

15

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

The Company may repurchase Units from Limited Members who have tendered their Units to the Company. Such Units may be acquired at a discount. The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 2 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company. During 2022 and 2021, the Company did not repurchase any Units from the Limited Members. 

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Members: 

AEI Income Growth Fund 25 LLC 

St. Paul, Minnesota 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AEI Income Growth Fund 25 LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in members' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Impairment of Real Estate Investments 

Description of the Matter 

As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company tests investments in real estate for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its carrying value. The Company s undiscounted future cash flows analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future rental rates, occupancy levels, costs to obtain a tenant, holding expenses while vacant, and estimated sale proceeds. If the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property. Fair value is determined based on independent appraisals, selling prices of comparable properties, sale agreements under negotiation, and/or final selling prices. 

We identified the impairment of real estate investments as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to evaluate the recoverability of real estate investments. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s assumptions in determining the recoverability of real estate assets was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the Company s real estate recoverability analysis included the following, among others: 

We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of controls over management s evaluation of recoverability of real estate property assets, including management s process for determining the key inputs utilized in estimating the undiscounted future cash flows. 

We evaluated the undiscounted cash flow analysis, including management s estimates of tenant occupancy, future rental income and estimated sale proceeds, for each real estate asset with possible impairment indicators by evaluating the adequacy and reasonableness of the source information and assumptions used by management and testing the mathematical accuracy of the analysis. 

We made inquiries of management regarding the current status of potential transactions and about management s judgments to understand the probability of future events that could affect the cash flow assumptions for the properties.

Although AFM requires that all of its personnel, including the Chief Financial Officer, engage in honest and ethical conduct, ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure, comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, and report to Ms. Nygard and Mr. Steele any deviation from these principles, because the organization is composed of only approximately 40 individuals, because the management of a company by an entity that has different interests in distributions and income than investors involves numerous conflicts of interest that must be resolved on a daily basis, and because the ultimate decision makers in all instances is Ms. Nygard and Mr. Steele, AFM has not adopted a formal code of conduct.
