A. General 
 We are a holding company and through wholly-owned subsidiaries we provide private mortgage insurance, other mortgage credit risk management solutions, and ancillary services. In 2022, our total revenues were 1.2 billion and our primary NIW was 76.4 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our direct primary IIF was 295.3 billion and our direct primary RIF was 76.5 billion. For further information about our results of operations, see our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and our MD A in Item 7. As of December 31, 2022, our principal mortgage insurance subsidiary, MGIC, was licensed in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. During 2022, we wrote new insurance in each of those jurisdictions. 
 2023 BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
 Our business strategies continue to be to 1) maximize the value we create through our mortgage credit enhancement activities; 2) differentiate ourselves through our customer experience; 3) establish a competitive advantage through our digital and analytical capabilities; 4) excel at acquiring, managing and distributing mortgage credit risk and the related capital; 5) maintain financial strength through economic cycles; and 6) foster an environment that embraces diversity and best positions our people to succeed. 
 2022 ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
 Following are several of our 2022 accomplishments that furthered our business strategies. 
 Earned 865 million of net income 2.79 per diluted share) for the year, compared to 635 million 1.85 per diluted share) in 2021. 
 Increased primary IIF by more than 7.6 year-over-year. 
 Expanded our reinsurance program by securing quota share reinsurance covering the majority of our 2022 and 2023 NIW, and executing excess of loss reinsurance through an ILN and the traditional reinsurance market. These transactions allow us to better manage our risk profile and they provide an alternative source of capital. 
 Paid 800 million of cash dividends from MGIC to our holding company. Maintained financial strength and capital flexibility while returning approximately 497 million in capital to shareholders: 
 Repurchased 8.7 of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
 Increased cash dividends by 25 in the second half of 2022. 
 Repurchased 89 million of our 2063 Junior Convertible Debentures, which eliminated approximately 6.8 million potentially dilutive shares. 

Redeemed the outstanding principal balance of the 5.75 Senior Notes at a purchase price of 248 million plus accrued interest. 
 Repaid the outstanding principal balance of the FHLB advance at a prepayment price of 156 million.

 Continued work on our Affordable Housing Strategy through ongoing participation in the Affordable Housing Advisory Board of the Mortgage Bankers Association and support of the Urban Institute's Housing Finance Innovation Forum, the National Housing Conference, the Coalition of Community Development Financial Institutions, the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, the National Conference of State Housing Agencies, and the National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies. 
 Made significant progress in our diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") work, including the formation of a DEI Council, leadership participation in DEI Workshops, and the creation of a DEI site on the Company's intranet page. 
 
 OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND ITS OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 
 We established the modern PMI industry in 1957 to provide a private market alternative to federal government insurance programs. PMI covers losses from homeowner defaults on residential mortgage loans, reducing, and in some instances eliminating, the loss to the insured institution. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ("the GSEs") have been the major purchasers of the mortgage loans underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers. The GSEs purchase residential mortgage loans as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs cannot buy low down payment mortgage loans without certain forms of credit enhancement. Private mortgage insurance has generally been purchased by lenders in primary mortgage market transactions to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. Therefore, PMI facilitates the sale of low down payment mortgages in the secondary mortgage market to the GSEs and plays an important role in the housing finance system by assisting consumers, especially first-time and low- and medium-wealth homebuyers, to finance homes with low down payment mortgages. PMI also reduces the regulatory capital that depository institutions are required to hold against certain low down payment mortgages that they hold as assets. 
 Because the GSEs have been the major purchasers of the mortgages underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers, the PMI industry in the U.S. is defined in large part by the requirements and practices of the GSEs. These requirements and practices, as well as those of the federal regulators that oversee the GSEs and lenders, impact the operating results and financial performance of private mortgage insurers. In 2008, the federal 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 8 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

government took control of the GSEs through a conservatorship process. The FHFA is the conservator of the GSEs and has the authority to control and direct their operations. 
 In 2022 the GSEs submitted Equitable Housing Finance Plans to the FHFA. The Plans seek to advance equity in housing finance over a three year period and include potential changes to the GSEs business practices and policies. Specifically relating to mortgage insurance, (1) Fannie Mae s Plan contemplates the creation of special purchase credit program(s) ("SPCPs") targeted to historically underserved borrowers with a goal of lowering costs for such borrowers through lower than standard mortgage insurance requirements; and (2) Freddie Mac s Plan contemplates the creation of SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers with the goals of (a) working with mortgage insurers to reduce costs for high LTV borrowers, and (b) updating mortgage insurance cancellation requirements. To the extent the business practices and policies of the GSEs regarding mortgage insurance coverage, costs and cancellation change, including more broadly than through SPCPs, such changes may negatively impact the mortgage insurance industry. 
 It is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business of any resulting changes is uncertain. Some changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when any action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. 
 The GSEs have private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements, or "PMIERs", for private mortgage insurers that insure loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s Available Assets to equal or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. In calculating Minimum Required Assets, we receive significant credit for risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions. See "Reinsurance" in this Item 1 for information about our reinsurance transactions and "Regulation Direct Regulation" in this Item 1 for information about our compliance with the financial requirements of the PMIERs. 
 The private mortgage insurance industry is greatly impacted by macroeconomic conditions that affect home loan originations and credit performance of home loans, including unemployment rates, home prices, restrictions on mortgage credit due to underwriting standards, interest rates, household formations and homeownership rates. During the years leading up to the financial crisis of the 2000s, the mortgage lending industry increasingly made home loans with higher risk profiles. In certain sections of this Annual Report, we discuss our insurance written in 2005-2008 separately from our insurance written in earlier and later years. Beginning in 2007, job creation slowed and the housing markets began slowing in certain areas, with declines in certain other areas. In 2008 and 2009, employment in the U.S. decreased substantially and nearly all geographic areas in the U.S. experienced home price declines. Together, these conditions resulted in significant adverse developments for us and our industry. The operating environment for private mortgage insurers materially improved after the financial crisis, as the economy recovered. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our 2020 financial results. The increased level of unemployment and 

economic uncertainty resulted in an increase in the number of mortgage delinquencies for which we recorded increased loss reserves. After reaching 14.7 in April 2020, the unemployment rate declined through the end of 2021, and remained below 4 for most of 2022. The number of delinquent mortgages that we insure has also declined through the end of 2022, after reaching its recent peak in June 2020. The decline in delinquent mortgages that we insure, along with favorable loss reserve development in 2022 resulted in our losses incurred significantly decreasing in 2022 compared to 2021, and our net income significantly increasing. For a discussion of the various ways the COVID-19 pandemic may impact us in the future, see our Risk Factor titled "The COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our business and future financial condition" in Item 1A. 
 In 2022, 405 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers, compared to 585 for the full year of 2021, and 600 billion for full year 2020. The 2022 and 2021 volumes were significantly greater than the recent low in 2010 of 70 billion and greater than the volumes of 2001 through 2007 when, on average, approximately 311 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers. The high 2021 and 2020 volumes resulted, in part, from historically low interest rates driving sustained borrower demand, including for refinances, and the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic had on demand for homes. 
 For most of our business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that sponsor government-backed mortgage insurance programs, principally the FHA, VA and USDA. The publication Inside Mortgage Finance estimates that in 2022, the FHA accounted for 26.7 of low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance, compared to 24.7 in 2021 and 23.4 in 2020. Since 2012, the FHA s market share has been as low as 23.4 (2020) and as high as 42.1 (in 2012). Factors that influence the FHA s market share include relative rates and fees, underwriting guidelines and loan limits of the FHA, VA, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs; lenders' perceptions of legal risks under FHA versus GSE programs; flexibility for the FHA to establish new products as a result of federal legislation and programs; returns expected to be obtained by lenders for Ginnie Mae securitization of FHA-insured loans compared to those obtained from selling loans to the GSEs for securitization; and differences in policy terms, such as the ability of a borrower to cancel insurance coverage under certain circumstances. The focus of the Presidential Administration on equitable housing finance and sustainable housing opportunities increases the likelihood of a reduction in the FHA s mortgage insurance premium rates. Such a rate reduction would negatively impact our NIW; however, given the many factors that influence the FHA's market share, it is difficult to predict the impact. In addition, we also cannot predict how the factors that affect the FHA s share of NIW will change in the future. 
 Inside Mortgage Finance estimates that in 2022, the VA accounted for 24.5 of all low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance, compared to 30.2 in 2021 and 30.9 in 2020. Since 2012, the VA's market share has been as low as 22.8 (in 2013) and as high a 30.9 (in 2020). We believe that the VA s market share grows as the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA s program increases and when eligible borrowers opt to use the VA program when refinancing their 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 9 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

mortgages. The VA program offers 100 LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount. 
 The private mortgage insurance industry also competes with alternatives to mortgage insurance, such as investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than PMI, including capital market transactions entered into by the GSEs and banks; lenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring; and piggyback loans, which combine a first lien loan with a second lien loan. In 2018, the GSEs initiated secondary mortgage market programs with loan level mortgage default coverage provided by various (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers governed by PMIERs, and that are not selected by the lenders. While we view these programs as competing with traditional private mortgage insurance, we participate in them through an affiliate of MGIC. 
 The GSEs (and other investors) have also used other forms of credit enhancement that did not involve traditional private mortgage insurance, such as engaging in credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors, including competitors and an affiliate of MGIC; and using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage. 
 In addition to the FHA, VA, other governmental agencies and the alternatives to mortgage insurance discussed above, we compete with other mortgage insurers. The level of competition, including price competition, within the private mortgage insurance industry has remained intense over the past several years. See "Our Products and Services Sales and Marketing and Competition Competition" below for more information about the impact on our business of competition in the private mortgage insurance industry. 
 In addition to being subject to the requirements and practices of the GSEs, private mortgage insurers are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, MGIC's domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. The NAIC previously announced plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. In December 2019, a working group of state regulators released an exposure draft of a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act and a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although certain items were not completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk and minimum capital floors. In October 2022, the NAIC working group released a revised exposure draft of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act that does not include changes to the capital requirements of the existing Model Act.

 B. Our Products and Services 
 MORTGAGE INSURANCE 
 In general, there are two principal types of private mortgage insurance: primary and pool. 
 Primary Insurance. Primary insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure on the mortgage or sale of the underlying property (collectively, the claim amount ). In addition to the loan principal, the claim amount is affected by the mortgage note rate and the time necessary to complete the foreclosure or sale process. The insurer generally pays the coverage percentage of the claim amount specified in the primary policy but has the option to pay 100 of the claim amount and acquire title to the property. Primary insurance is generally written on first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied "single-family" homes, which are one-to-four family homes and condominiums. Primary insurance can be written on first liens secured by non-owner occupied single-family homes, which are referred to in the home mortgage lending industry as investor loans, and on vacation or second homes. Primary coverage can be used on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument approved by the mortgage insurer. 
 References in this document to amounts of insurance written or in force, risk written or in force, and other historical data related to our insurance refer only to direct (before giving effect to reinsurance) primary insurance, unless otherwise indicated. Primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or may be written on a bulk basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single, bulk transaction. Our new primary insurance written was 76.4 billion in 2022, compared to 120.2 billion in 2021 and 112.1 billion in 2020. The 2022 decrease compared to 2021 reflects a decrease in purchase mortgage originations we insured, as well as a decrease in refinance mortgage originations we insured.

 For loans sold to a GSE, the coverage percentage must comply with the requirements established by the particular GSE to which the loan is delivered. The GSEs have different loan purchase programs that allow different levels of mortgage insurance coverage. Under the charter coverage program, on certain loans lenders may choose a mortgage insurance coverage percentage that is less than the GSEs standard coverage and only the minimum required by the GSEs charters, with the GSEs paying a lower price for such loans. In 2022, a substantial majority of our volume was on loans with GSE standard or higher coverage. 
 For loans that are not sold to the GSEs, the lender determines the coverage percentage from those that we offer. Higher coverage percentages generally result in increased severity, which is the amount paid on a claim. We charge higher premium rates for higher coverage percentages. However, there can be no assurance that the higher premium rates adequately reflect the risks associated with higher coverage percentages. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, loss reserves are only established for policies covering delinquent loans. Historically, because relatively few delinquencies occur in the early years of a book of business, the higher premium revenue from higher coverage has been recognized before any significant higher losses resulting from that higher coverage may be incurred. For more information, see Exposure to Catastrophic Loss; Delinquencies; Claims; Loss Mitigation. 
 In general, mortgage insurance coverage cannot be terminated by the insurer. However, subject to certain restrictions on our rescission rights as specified in our insurance policy, we may terminate or rescind coverage for, among other reasons, non-payment of premium, certain material misrepresentations and fraud in connection with the application for the insurance policy. Mortgage insurance coverage is renewable at the option of the insured lender, at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured. Lenders may cancel insurance written on a flow basis at any time at their option or because of mortgage repayment, which may be accelerated because of the refinancing of mortgages. 
 In the case of a loan purchased by a GSE, a borrower may request termination of insurance based on the home s current value if certain LTV ratio and seasoning requirements are met and the borrowers have an acceptable payment history. For loans seasoned between two and five years, the LTV ratio must be 75 or less, and for loans seasoned more than five years the LTV ratio must be 80 or less. If the borrower has made substantial improvements to the property, the GSEs allow for cancellation once the LTV ratio reaches 80 or less with no minimum seasoning requirement. 
 Mortgage insurance for loans secured by one-family, primary residences can be canceled under the Homeowners Protection Act HOPA ). In general, HOPA requires a servicer to cancel the mortgage insurance if a borrower requests cancellation when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 80 of 

the original value of the property, or reaches that percentage through payments, if 1) the borrower is current on the loan and has a good payment history (as defined by HOPA), 2) if required by the mortgage owner, the borrower provides evidence that the value of the property has not declined below the original value, and 3) if required by the mortgage owner, the borrower certifies that the borrower s equity in the property is not subject to a subordinate lien. Additionally, HOPA requires mortgage insurance to terminate automatically when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 78 of the original value of the property and the borrower is current on loan payments or thereafter becomes current. Annually, servicers must inform borrowers of their right to cancel or terminate mortgage insurance. The provisions of HOPA described above apply only to borrower paid mortgage insurance, which is described below. 
 Coverage tends to continue for borrowers experiencing economic difficulties or living in areas experiencing home price depreciation. The persistency of coverage for those borrowers, coupled with cancellation of coverage for other borrowers, can increase the percentage of an insurer s portfolio covering loans with more credit risk. This development can also occur during periods of heavy mortgage refinancing because borrowers experiencing property value appreciation are less likely to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing, while borrowers not experiencing property value appreciation are more likely to continue to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing or not qualify for refinancing at all (including if they have experienced economic difficulties) and thus remain subject to the mortgage insurance coverage. 
 The percentage of NIW on loans representing refinances was 3 for 2022, compared to 20 for 2021 and 36 for 2020. When a borrower refinances a mortgage loan insured by us by paying it off in full with the proceeds of a new mortgage that is also insured by us, the insurance on that existing mortgage is cancelled, and insurance on the new mortgage is considered to be NIW. Therefore, continuation of our coverage from a refinanced loan to a new loan results in both a cancellation of insurance and NIW. When a lender and borrower modify a loan rather than replace it with a new one or enter into a new loan pursuant to a loan modification program, our insurance continues without being cancelled, assuming that we consent to the modification or new loan. As a result, such modifications or new loans are not included in our NIW. 
 In addition to varying with the coverage percentage, our premium rates for insurance have varied depending upon the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan and thus have taken into account, among other things, the LTV ratio, the borrower s credit score and DTI ratio, the number of borrowers, the property location, the mortgage term and whether the property is the borrower s primary residence. In recent years, the mortgage insurance industry has materially reduced its use of standard rate cards, which were fairly consistent among competitors, and correspondingly increased its use of (i)pricing systems that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters, and (ii) customized rate plans, both of which typically have rates lower than the standard rate card. 
 
 The borrower s mortgage loan instrument may require the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. Our industry refers to the related mortgage insurance as borrower-paid or BPMI. If the borrower is not required to pay the premium and 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 11 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

mortgage insurance is required in connection with the origination of the loan, then the premium is paid by the lender, who may recover the premium through an increase in the note rate on the mortgage or higher origination fees. Our industry refers to the related mortgage insurance as lender-paid or LPMI. Most of our primary IIF is BPMI. 
 There are several payment plans available to the borrower, or lender, as the case may be. Under the single premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us in advance a single payment covering a specified term exceeding twelve months. Under the monthly premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us a monthly premium payment to provide only one month of coverage. Under the annual premium plan, an annual premium is paid to us in advance, with annual renewal premiums paid in advance thereafter. 
 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the single premium plan represented approximately 4 , 7 and 9 , respectively, of our NIW. The monthly premium plan represented approximately 96 , 93 and 91 , respectively. The annual premium plan represented less than 1 of NIW in each of those years. Depending upon the actual life of a single premium policy and its premium rate relative to that of a monthly premium policy, a single premium policy may generate more or less premium than a monthly premium policy over its life. 
 Pool and Other Insurance. Pool insurance is generally used as an additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers the amount of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if primary insurance is required on that mortgage loan, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan which did not require primary insurance. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible. We have written no new pool insurance since 2008; however, for a variety of reasons, including responding to capital market alternatives to PMI and customer demands, we may write pool risk in the future. As of December 31, 2022, our direct pool RIF was 276 million 196 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and 80 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits). 
 
 In connection with the GSEs' credit risk transfer programs, we provide insurance and reinsurance covering portions of the credit risk related to certain reference pools of mortgages acquired by the GSEs.

 (3) Loans within the conforming loan limit have an original principal balance that does not exceed the maximum original principal balance of loans that the GSEs will purchase. The conforming loan limit for one unit properties was 510,400 for 2020, 548,250 for 2021, and 647,200 for 2022, and is 726,200 for 2023. The limit for high cost communities has been higher and is 1,089,300 for 2023. Non-conforming loans are loans with an original principal balance above the conforming loan limit.

(5) Reduced documentation loans were originated prior to 2009 under programs in which there was a reduced level of verification or disclosure compared to traditional mortgage loan underwriting, including programs in which the borrower s income and/or assets were disclosed in the loan application but there was no verification of those disclosures ("stated" documentation) and programs in which there was no disclosure of income or assets in the loan application ("no" documentation). In accordance with industry practice, loans approved by GSE and other automated underwriting (AU) systems under doc waiver programs that did not require verification of borrower income are classified by us as full documentation. We understand that the GSEs terminated their doc waiver programs in the second half of 2008. 
 (6) Represents the FICO score at loan origination. The weighted average decision FICO score at loan origination for NIW in 2022 was 747 compared to 749 in 2021. The FICO score for a loan with multiple borrowers is the lowest of the borrowers decision FICO scores. A borrower s decision FICO score is determined as follows: if there are three FICO scores available, the middle FICO score is used; if two FICO scores are available, the lower of the two is used; if only one FICO score is available, it is used. A FICO score is a score based on a borrower s credit history generated by a model developed by Fair Isaac Corporation.

OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 Contract Underwriting . A non-insurance subsidiary of ours provides contract underwriting services for lenders, pursuant to which loans are underwritten to conform to prescribed guidelines. The guidelines might be the lender's own guidelines or the guidelines of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a non-GSE investor. These services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. 
 Other . We provide insurance and reinsurance related to certain mortgages under GSE credit risk transfer programs. The amount of risk associated with these transactions is currently 226 million. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 Originators of residential mortgage loans such as savings institutions, commercial banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions, mortgage bankers and other lenders have historically determined the placement of mortgage insurance written on a flow basis and as a result are our customers. To obtain primary insurance from us written on a flow basis, a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive a mortgage guaranty master policy from us. Our top 10 customers generated 33 of our NIW on a flow basis in 2022, 36 in 2021 and 41 in 2020. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including if our premium rates are higher than those of our competitors, our underwriting requirements are more restrictive than those of our competitors, or our customers are dissatisfied with our claims-paying practices (including insurance policy rescissions and claim curtailments). Information about some of the other factors that can affect a mortgage insurer s relationship with its customers can be found in our risk factor titled Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses in Item 1A . 
 SALES AND MARKETING AND COMPETITION 
 Sales and Marketing. Our employees sell our insurance products throughout all regions of the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam. 
 Competition. Our competition includes other mortgage insurers, governmental agencies and products designed to eliminate the need to purchase private mortgage insurance. For flow business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state government and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. The FHA, VA and USDA sponsor government-backed mortgage insurance programs, and it is estimated that during 2022, they accounted for a combined approximately 52.8 of the total low down payment residential mortgages which were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance, compared to 56.8 and 56.1 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information about the market share of the FHA and the VA, see Overview of the Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment above. 
 The PMI industry is highly competitive. We believe that we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on premium rates, underwriting requirements, financial strength (including based on credit or financial strength ratings), customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, strength of management teams and field organizations, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders, and the effective use 

of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. 
 The U.S. PMI industry currently consists of six active mortgage insurers and their affiliates, including MGIC. Our market share (as measured by NIW) was 18.9 in 2022, compared to 20.6 in 2021 and 18.7 in 2020, in each case excluding HARP refinances. (source: Inside Mortgage Finance ). 
 If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries, our future new insurance written could be negatively affected. Our ability to participate in the non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securities market (the size of which has been limited since 2008, but may grow in the future), could depend on our ability to maintain and improve our investment grade ratings for our insurance subsidiaries. Although the current PMIERs of each of the GSEs do not require an insurer to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, the GSEs consider financial strength ratings to be important when using forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance. 
 
 In assigning financial strength ratings, in addition to considering the adequacy of the mortgage insurer s capital to withstand very high claim scenarios under assumptions determined by the rating agency, we believe rating agencies review a mortgage insurer s historical and projected operating performance, franchise risk, business outlook, competitive position, management, corporate strategy, enterprise risk management and other factors. The rating agency issuing the financial strength rating can withdraw or change its rating at any time. At the time that this annual report was finalized, the financial strength of MGIC was rated A- (with a stable outlook) by A.M. Best, A3 (with a stable outlook) by Moody s Investors Service and BBB+ (with a stable outlook) by Standard Poor s Rating Services.

C. Risk Management 
 ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 
 The Company has an enterprise risk management ERM framework that it believes is commensurate with the size, nature and complexity of the Company s business activities (all of which relate to insuring or reinsuring mortgage credit risk) and strategies. Among the key objectives of the ERM framework are to have a clear and well documented shared understanding, by senior management and the Board, of the Company s risk management philosophy and overall appetite for risk, and that there are appropriate monitoring, management and reporting mechanisms to support the framework. 
 Risk Governance . The Company maintains a Senior Management Oversight Committee SMOC that, at the management level, serves as its primary risk management governance organization. The SMOC oversees the Company s ERM framework; maintains an enterprise view of risk across a set of identified key risks that may exist from time to time (see Risk Identification and Assessment below); and provides support and reporting to the Risk Management Committee of the Company s Board of Directors RMC ). The SMOC, of which the CEO is a member, is chaired by the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, who is the principal management liaison to the RMC. 
 The Board implements its risk oversight function as a whole and through delegation to its Committees which meet regularly and report back to the full Board. The Risk Management Committee coordinates with the Board and other Board Committees regarding the assignment to the Board and Committees of oversight responsibilities for all risks considered to have the greatest impact on the Company's ability to accomplish its strategic goals. Each Committee's charter describes its principal responsibilities, including its oversight responsibility for applicable key risks. 
 Corporate Sustainability Risk Governance . The Company maintains a Corporate Sustainability Executive Council that, at the management level, supports the Company's on-going commitment to environmental, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, sustainability, and other public policy matters relevant to the Company. In performing this general responsibility, the Council has discretion to: adopt the Company s general strategy with respect to sustainability matters; identify current and emerging sustainability issues that may affect the Company s business, strategy, operations, performance, or public image; make recommendations regarding policies, practices, procedures, or disclosures to address sustainability matters; oversee the Company s internal and external reporting and disclosures surrounding sustainability matters; and advise on material concerns of shareholders or stakeholders regarding sustainability matters. The Corporate Sustainability Executive Council will make regular reports to the SLT and to the relevant Committee(s) of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 The Board has delegated oversight for the following ESG matters to the following committees, who regularly report their actions to the Board: 
 Risk Management Committee: Mortgage Credit Risk, including risks associated with climate change. 
 Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee: Corporate governance and human capital 

management policies such as executive compensation; succession planning; recruitment, retention and development of management resources; workforce planning, recruitment morale and talent; diversity and inclusion initiatives; and work environment, including health and safety. 
 Securities Investment Committee: Our investment portfolio; such oversight may include consideration of ESG factors. 
 Audit Committee: Disclosure controls and procedures relating to financial reports made to the SEC, as well as ESG reports. 
 Business Transformation and Technology Committee: Cybersecurity and business continuity. 
 Risk Management and Controls . The Company has established enterprise-wide policies, procedures and processes to allow it to identify, assess, monitor and manage the Company s various risks. Management of these risks is an interdepartmental endeavor, with oversight by the Chief Risk Officer and the SMOC. The Company s Internal Audit function, which reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, provides independent ongoing assessments of the Company s management of certain enterprise risks and reports its findings to the Audit Committee. 
 Risk Identification and Assessment . On a regular basis, the Company monitors key risks with a focus on identifying risks or changes to risks with the greatest impact on the Company's ability to accomplish its strategic goals. In addition to the ongoing monitoring, the Company also identifies key risks in a bottom up process facilitated through questionnaires and discussions during an annual compliance and risk forum with co-workers across all business functions. The results of the identification process are reported to and reviewed annually by the SMOC and presented to the RMC and/or the full Board. 
 Risk Reporting and Communication . The Company's Risk Management department produces various analyses, reports and key risk indicators KRIs that are reported to the SMOC, the RMC and the Board quarterly. For our largest risk exposure, mortgage credit risk, these KRIs include risk factors for the Company s NIW, IIF, quality control and claim activity, and the quarterly reports include performance relative to metrics and thresholds. Each of the other Board Committees also receive regular reporting concerning the risks they oversee. 
 Although the Company has in place the ERM framework discussed above, it may not be effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face. For more information, see our Risk Factor titled "If our risk management programs are not effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face, or if the models used in our businesses are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition" in Item 1A. 
 MORTGAGE CREDIT RISK 
 We believe that mortgage credit risk is materially affected by: 
 
 the condition of the economy, including the direction of change in home prices and employment, in the area in which the property is located; 
 the borrower s credit profile, including the borrower s credit history, DTI ratio and cash reserves, and the 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 17 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

willingness of a borrower with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when the mortgage balance exceeds the value of the home; 
 the loan product, which encompasses the LTV ratio, the type of loan instrument, including whether the instrument provides for fixed or variable payments and the amortization schedule, the type of property and the purpose of the loan; 
 origination practices of lenders and the percentage of coverage on insured loans; and 
 the size of insured loans. 
 
 We believe that, excluding other factors, claim incidence increases: 
 
 during periods of economic contraction and home price depreciation, including when these conditions may not be nationwide, compared to periods of economic expansion and home price appreciation; 
 for loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores compared to loans to borrowers with higher FICO scores; 
 for loans to borrowers with higher DTI ratios compared to loans to borrowers with lower DTI ratios; 
 for loans with less than full underwriting documentation compared to loans with full underwriting documentation; 
 for loans with higher LTV ratios compared to loans with lower LTV ratios; 
 for variable payment loans when the reset interest rate significantly exceeds the interest rate at the time of loan origination; 
 for loans that permit the deferral of principal amortization compared to loans that require principal amortization with each monthly payment; 
 for loans in which the original loan amount exceeds the conforming loan limit compared to loans below that limit; and 
 for cash out refinance loans compared to rate and term refinance loans. 
 
 Other types of loan characteristics relating to the individual loan or borrower may also affect the risk potential for a loan. The presence of a number of higher-risk characteristics in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a claim on such a loan unless there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk. 
 
 We charge higher premium rates to reflect the increased risk of claim incidence that we perceive is associated with a loan. Not all higher risk characteristics are reflected in our premium rates; however, in 2019 we introduced MiQ, our risk-based pricing system that establishes our premium rates based on more risk attributes than were considered in 2018. There can be no assurance that our premium rates adequately reflect the increased risk, particularly in a period of economic recession, high unemployment, slowing home price appreciation or home 

price declines, or when extraordinary events occur, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, periods of extreme inflation, or environmental disasters related to changing climactic conditions. For additional information, see our risk factors in Item 1A , including the one titled The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liabilities for losses and as a result any inadequacy could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Underwriting Insurance Applications. Applications for mortgage insurance are submitted to us through both our delegated and non-delegated options. Under the delegated option, applications are submitted to us electronically and we rely upon the lender s representations and warranties that the data submitted is true, accurate and consistent with the documents in the lender's loan origination file, when making our insurance decision. If the loan data submitted meets the underwriting requirements, a commitment to insure the loan is immediately issued. If the requirements are not met, the loan is reviewed by one of our underwriters. Non-delegated applications are submitted with documents from the lender s loan origination file. We apply our underwriting guidelines, eligibility criteria and rating plans to determine coverage eligibility and premium rate. If the loan is eligible for coverage, we will issue a commitment to insure the loan. 
 
 Beginning in 2013, we aligned most of our underwriting requirements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for loans that receive and are processed in accordance with certain approval recommendations from a GSE automated underwriting system. Our underwriting requirements are available on our website at http://www.mgic.com/underwriting/index.html. Our underwriters are authorized to approve loans that do not meet all of our underwriting requirements under certain circumstances. 
 
 Exposure to Catastrophic Losses. The PMI industry experienced catastrophic losses in the mid-to-late 1980s, similar to the losses we experienced in 2007-2013. For background information about such losses in 2007-2013, as well as information about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to General Overview of Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment above. 
 Delinquencies . The claim cycle on PMI generally begins with the insurer s receipt of notification of a delinquency on an insured loan from the loan servicer. For reporting purposes, a loan is generally considered to be delinquent when it is two or more payments past due. Most servicers report delinquent loans to us within this two month period. The incidence of delinquency is affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, the level of borrower income growth, unemployment, health issues, family status, the level of interest rates, rates of home price appreciation or depreciation and general borrower creditworthiness. Delinquencies that are not cured result in a claim to us. See Claims. Delinquencies may be cured by the borrower bringing current the delinquent loan payments or by a sale of the property and the satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In addition, when a policy is rescinded or a claim is denied we remove the loan from our delinquency inventory.

The following table shows the number of insured primary and pool loans, the related number of delinquent loans and the percentage of delinquent loans, or delinquency rate, as of December 31, 2018-2022.

 Different geographical areas may experience different delinquency rates due to varying localized economic conditions from year to year and the amount of time it takes for foreclosures to be completed for uncured delinquencies. The primary delinquency rate for the top 15 jurisdictions (based on December 31, 2022 delinquency inventory) at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 appears in table the below. 
 Primary delinquency rate by jurisdiction 2022 2021 2020 Florida 3.1 3.7 7.5 Texas 2.3 3.1 6.1 Illinois 2.6 3.4 5.9 Pennsylvania 2.2 2.5 4.0 New York 3.5 4.3 6.9 California 2.2 3.2 6.1 Ohio 2.2 2.4 4.0 Michigan 1.9 2.4 4.0 Georgia 2.3 3.1 6.2 New Jersey 2.9 4.1 7.0 North Carolina 1.7 2.3 4.2 Maryland 2.4 3.3 6.0 Indiana 2.3 2.8 4.4 Virginia 1.4 1.9 4.2 Minnesota 1.6 2.0 3.5 All other jurisdictions 2.0 2.6 4.6 Note: Asterisk denotes jurisdictions in the table above that predominately use a judicial foreclosure process, which generally increases the amount of time it takes for a foreclosure to be completed. 
 
 The primary delinquency inventory in those same jurisdictions at December 31, 2022 and 2021 appears in Management s Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Results of Operations Losses and expenses Loss Reserves, in Item 7 . 

Claims. Claims result from delinquencies that are not cured or a short sale that we approve. Whether a claim results from an uncured delinquency depends, in large part, on the borrower s equity in the home at the time of delinquency, the borrower s or the lender s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage and the willingness and ability of the borrower and lender to enter into a loan modification that provides for a cure of the delinquency. Various factors affect the frequency and amount of claims, including local home prices and employment levels, and interest rates. If a delinquency goes to claim, any renewal premiums collected to insure the loan during the time period between the last paid installment and the claim payment is returned to the servicer along with the claim payment. 
 
 Under the terms of our master policy, the lender is required to file a claim for primary insurance with us within 60 days after it has acquired title to the underlying property (typically through foreclosure). For several years, the average time it took to receive a claim associated with a delinquency increased significantly from our historical experience of approximately twelve months. This was, in part, due to new loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and to changes in some state foreclosure laws that may have included, for example, a requirement for additional review and/or mediation processes. Prior to the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to experience a decline in the average time it took servicers to process foreclosures, which had reduced the average time to receive a claim associated with new delinquencies that did not cure. Generally, the longer the period between delinquency and claim filing, the greater the size of the claim, or severity. It is difficult to estimate how long it may take for current and future delinquencies that do not cure to develop into paid claims. In light of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance programs, the average number of missed payments at the time a claim is received has increased. 
 
 The majority of loans we insured from 2005 through 2008 (which represent 32 of the loans in the delinquency inventory) are covered by master policy terms that, except under certain circumstances, do not limit the number of years of accumulated interest that an insured may include in a claim. Under our current 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 19 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

master policy terms, an insured can include accumulated interest only for the first three years the loan is delinquent. 
 
 Other determinants of claim severity are the amount of the mortgage loan, the coverage percentage on the loan, loss mitigation efforts, and local market conditions. For information about our primary average claim paid, see Management s Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Results of Operations Net Losses and LAE Paid, in Item 7 . 
 
 Within 60 days after a claim has been filed and all documents required to be submitted to us have been delivered, we generally have the option to either (1) pay the coverage percentage specified for the insured loan, with the insured retaining title to the underlying property and receiving all proceeds from the eventual sale of the property (we have elected this option for the majority of claim payments in the recent past), (2) pay the loss on the sale of the property if it has already been sold (calculated by subtracting the sale proceeds from the claim amount) or (3) pay 100 of the claim amount in exchange for conveyance to us of good and marketable title to the property. After we receive title to a property, we sell it for our own account. If we fail to pay a claim timely, we are subject to additional interest expense. 
 
 Claim activity is not evenly spread throughout the coverage period of a book of primary business. Relatively few claims are typically received during the first two years following issuance of coverage on a loan. The highest level of claim activity has typically occurred in the third and fourth years after the year of loan origination. Thereafter, the number of claims received has typically declined at a gradual rate, although the rate of decline can be affected by conditions in the economy, including slowing home price appreciation or home price depreciation. Moreover, when a loan is refinanced, because the new loan replaces, and is a continuation of, an earlier loan, the pattern of claims frequency for that new loan may be different from the typical pattern for other loans. Persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment, and other factors can affect the pattern of claim activity. For example, a weak economy can lead to claims from older books of business increasing, continuing at stable levels or experiencing a lower rate of decline. As of December 31, 2022, 80 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2019, 85 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2018, and 88 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2017. See Our Products and Services Mortgage Insurance Primary Insurance In Force and Risk In Force by Policy Year above. 
 
 Loss Mitigation . Before paying a claim, generally we review the loan and servicing files to determine the appropriateness of the claim amount. Our insurance policies generally provide that we can reduce or deny a claim if the servicer did not comply with its obligations under our insurance policy, including the requirement to mitigate our loss by performing reasonable loss mitigation efforts or, for example, diligently pursuing a foreclosure or bankruptcy relief in a timely manner. We call such reduction of claims submitted to us curtailments. In each of 2022 and 2021, curtailments reduced our average claim paid by approximately 6.3 and 4.4 , respectively. The COVID-19-related foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance plans, along with increased home prices, resulted in decreased claims paid activity beginning in the second quarter of 2020. It is difficult to predict the level of curtailments once the foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance plans end. 

When reviewing the loan file associated with a claim, we may determine that we have the right to rescind coverage on the loan. In our SEC reports, we refer to insurance rescissions and denials of claims as rescissions and variations of this term. The circumstances in which we are entitled to rescind coverage narrowed under more restrictive policy terms beginning in 2012. As a result of revised PMIERs requirements, we have revised our master policy effective for new insurance written beginning March 1, 2020. Our ability to rescind insurance coverage has become further limited for insurance we write under the new master policy, potentially resulting in higher losses than would be the case under our previous master policies. In recent years, an immaterial percentage of claims received in a quarter have been resolved by rescissions. We do not expect future rescissions will be a significant portion of the claims we resolve over the next few years. 
 
 Our loss reserving methodology incorporates our estimates of future rescissions, curtailments, and reversals of rescissions and curtailments. When we rescind coverage, we return all premiums previously paid to us under the policy and are relieved of our obligation to pay a claim under the policy. A variance between ultimate actual rescission, curtailment or reversal rates and our estimates, as a result of the outcome of litigation, settlements or other factors, could materially affect our losses. 
 
 When the insured disputes our right to rescind coverage or curtail a claim, we generally engage in discussions in an attempt to settle the dispute. If we are unable to reach a settlement, the outcome of a dispute ultimately may be determined by legal proceedings. Under ASC 450-20, until a liability associated with settlement discussions or legal proceedings becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated, we consider our claim payment or rescission resolved for financial reporting purposes and do not accrue an estimated loss. When we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we record our best estimate of our probable loss. 

Loss Reserves . A significant period of time typically elapses between the time when a borrower becomes delinquent on a mortgage payment, which is the event triggering a potential future claim payment by us, the reporting of the delinquency to us, the acquisition of the property by the lender (typically through foreclosure) or the sale of the property, and the eventual payment of the claim related to the uncured delinquency or a rescission. To recognize the estimated liability for losses related to outstanding reported delinquencies, we establish loss reserves by estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. Our loss reserve estimates are established primarily based upon historical experience, including rescission and curtailment activity. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, we generally do not establish case reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently delinquent. 
 
 We also establish reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims, general expenses of administering the claims settlement process, legal fees and other fees loss adjustment expenses ), and for losses and loss adjustment expenses from delinquencies that have occurred, but have not yet been reported to us (IBNR). 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 20 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Our reserving process bases our estimates of future events on our past experience. For further information about our loss reserving methodology, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Estimates, in Item 7 . Estimation of loss reserves is inherently judgmental and conditions that have affected the development of the loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future, in either a similar manner or to a similar degree. For further information, see our risk factors in Item 1A , including the ones titled Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods, and Because loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, paid claims may be substantially different than our loss reserves. 
 
 Our losses incurred were (254.6) million in 2022, compared to 64.6 million and 364.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our losses incurred in 2020 were above the levels of the other years shown as a result of losses stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. For information about losses incurred from 2020 to 2022, including the amounts of losses incurred that are associated with delinquency notices received in the reporting year compared to losses incurred associated with delinquency notices received in prior years, see Note 8 "Loss Reserves" to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 
 D. Reinsurance Agreements 
 We have in place quota share reinsurance ("QSR") and excess of loss reinsurance ("XOL") transactions providing various amounts of coverage on 85 of our risk in force as of December 31, 2022. These transactions allow us to better manage our risk profile and because they reduce the amount of capital we are required to hold to comply with insurance regulatory requirements and the requirements of the GSEs' PMIERs. 
 
 Quota Share Transactions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 68 and 78 , respectively, of our IIF was subject to quota share reinsurance ("QSR") transactions. In 2022 and 2021, approximately 87 and 82 , respectively, of our NIW was subject to QSR transactions. 
 
 Our QSR transactions are with unaffiliated reinsurers and cover most of our insurance written from 2020 through 2023, and a smaller percentage of our insurance written from 2024 through 2025. The weighted average coverage percentage of our QSR transactions was 33 , based on risk in force as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The structure of the QSR transactions is a quota share of various percentages of the policies covered, with a ceding commission and a profit commission. Generally, under the transactions, we will receive an annual profit commission provided the annual loss ratio on the loans covered under the transactions remains below various percentages, depending upon the transaction. 
 
 Excess of Loss Transactions . We have XOL transactions with a panel of unaffiliated reinsurers executed through the traditional reinsurance market Traditional XOL") and with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re") transactions. Our Home Re transactions issued notes linked to the reinsurance coverage ("Insurance Linked Notes" or "ILNs"). Our XOL transactions provide XOL reinsurance coverage for a portion of the risk associated with certain mortgage insurance policies having 

insurance coverage in force dates from July 1, 2016 through March 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 through December 30, 2022, all dates inclusive. 
 
 For the reinsurance coverage periods, we retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses, and the reinsurers will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The aggregate XOL reinsurance coverage decreases over a period of either 10 of 12.5 years, depending on the transaction, subject to certain conditions, as the underlying covered mortgages amortize or are repaid, or mortgage insurance losses are paid. 
 
 The special purpose insurers financed the coverages with the proceeds of the ILNs in an aggregate amount equal to the initial reinsurance coverage amounts. Each ILN is non-recourse to any of our assets. The proceeds of the ILNs, which were deposited into reinsurance trusts for our benefit, will be the source of reinsurance claim payments to us and principal repayments on the ILNs. 
 Although reinsuring against possible loan losses does not discharge us from liability to a policyholder, it reduces the amount of capital we are required to retain against potential future losses for PMIERs, rating agency and insurance regulatory purposes. The calculated credit for XOL reinsurance transactions under PMIERs is generally based on the PMIERs requirement of the covered loans and the attachment and detachment point of the coverage, all of which fluctuate over time. PMIERs credit is generally not given for the reinsured risk above the PMIERs requirement. The GSEs have discretion to further limit reinsurance credit under the PMIERs. The total credit for risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions is subject to periodic review by the GSEs. 
 
 For further information about our reinsurance agreements, including the Company's early termination rights, see Note 9 Reinsurance, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, and our risk factor titled "Reinsurance may not always be available or its cost may increase" in Item 1A. 

E. Investment Portfolio 
 POLICY AND STRATEGY 
 At December 31, 2022, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately 5.4 billion. In addition, at December 31, 2022, our total assets included approximately 333 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2022, approximately 647 million of investments and cash and cash equivalents was held by our parent company, and the remainder was held by our subsidiaries, primarily MGIC. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 95 of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was managed by two external investment managers, although we maintain overall control of investment policy and strategy. We maintain direct management of the remainder of our investment portfolio. Unless otherwise indicated, the remainder of the discussion regarding our investment portfolio refers to our investment portfolio only and not to cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 The investment policy of our operating companies (primarily MGIC) emphasizes preservation of PMIERs assets, limiting 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 21 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

portfolio volatility and maximizing total return with an emphasis on yield (subject to the other objectives). Our holding company investment policy emphasizes providing liquidity with minimal realized losses through holding high credit quality, low volatility assets. Consequently, our investment portfolio consists almost entirely of high-quality, investment grade, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio strategy considers tax efficiency. The mix of tax-exempt municipal securities in our investment portfolio will be dependent upon their value, relative to taxable equivalent securities, determined in part by federal statutory tax rates. Our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions and our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements. 
 
 Our investment policies in effect at December 31, 2022 limit investments in the securities of a single issuer, other than the U.S. government, and generally limit the purchase of fixed income securities to those that are rated investment grade by at least one rating agency. They also limit the amount of investment in foreign governments and foreign domiciled securities and in any individual foreign country. In addition, the guidelines require the portfolio to carry a weighted average credit quality of at least an "A" rating. 
 
 The aggregate market value of the holdings of a single obligor, or type of investment, as applicable, is limited to: 
 U.S. government and GNMA securities No limit Pre-refunded municipals escrowed in Treasury securities No limit Individual U.S. government agencies (1) 
 10 of portfolio market value Individual securities rated AAA or AA (2) 
 3 of portfolio market value Individual securities rated BBB or A (2) 
 2 of portfolio market value Foreign governments foreign domiciled securities (in total) (3) 
 25 of portfolio market value 
 (1) As used with respect to our investment portfolio, U.S. government agencies include all GSEs and Federal Home Loan Banks. 
 (2) For the holding company, individual securities with a rating of "AA" or "AAA" may represent a maximum 10 of the portfolio market value and individual securities with a rating of "BBB" or "A" may represent a maximum 5 . 
 (3) For the holding company, there is no maximum aggregate limit for foreign government or foreign domiciled securities. 
 
 For information about the credit ratings of securities in our investment portfolio, see "Balance Sheet Review" in Item 7 . 

Investment Operations 
 At December 31, 2022, the sectors represented in our investment portfolio were as shown in the table below:

 We have no derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Securities with stated maturities due within up to one year, after one year and up to five years, after five years and up to ten years, and after ten years, represented 8 , 24 , 32 and 20 , respectively, of the total fair value of our fixed income investment securities. Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are not included in these maturity categories as the expected maturities may be different from the stated maturities depending upon the periodic payments during the life of the security. Asset-backed securities represent 13 of the investment portfolio (CLOs represent 6 , CMBS represent 5 and other asset-backed securities represent 2 ). GNMA and other agency mortgage-backed securities represent 4 of the investment portfolio. Our pre-tax yield was 3.0 , 2.5 , and 2.6 for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and our after-tax yield was 2.5 , 2.1 , and 2.1 for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

F. Regulation 
 Direct Regulation 
 We are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insured policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. 
 
 In general, regulation of our subsidiaries businesses relates to: 
 minimum capital levels and adequacy ratios; 
 requirements regarding contingency reserves; 
 premium rates and discrimination in pricing; 
 licenses to transact businesses; 
 policy forms; 
 insurable loans; 
 annual and other reports on financial condition; 
 the basis upon which assets and liabilities must be stated; 
 reinsurance requirements; 
 limitations on the types of investment instruments which may be held in an investment portfolio; 
 privacy; 
 deposits of securities; 
 transactions among affiliates; 
 restrictions on transactions that have the effect of inducing lenders to place business with the insurer; 
 cybersecurity; 
 limits on dividends payable (for a description of limits on dividends payable to us from MGIC, see Note 14 Statutory Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8); 
 suitability of officers and directors; and 
 claims handling. 
 
 Future regulation is expected to address the use of algorithms, artificial intelligence and data and analytics to determine pricing and for other purposes. 
 Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Act, which requires, among other things, that we conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA"), at least annually, to assess the material risks associated with our business and our current and estimated projected future solvency position; and maintain a risk management framework to assess, monitor, manage and report on material risks. Wisconsin has also adopted the annual enterprise risk reporting and "Corporate Governance Disclosure" requirements of the NAIC Model Act. 
 
 The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, currently the most common State Capital Requirements allow for 

a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position. MGIC's policyholder position includes its net worth or surplus and its contingency reserve. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was 10.2 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was 3.5 billion above the required MPP of 2.1 billion. 
 
 The NAIC previously announced plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. In December 2019, a working group of state regulators released an exposure draft of a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act and a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although certain terms were not completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk and minimum capital floors. In October 2022, the NAIC working group released a revised exposure draft of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act that does not include changes to the capital requirements of the existing Model Act. See our risk factors We may not continue to meet the GSEs mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility and State Capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis in Item 1A, for information about regulations governing our capital adequacy and our expectations regarding our future capital position. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Adequacy" in Item 7 for information about our current capital position. 
 
 We are required to establish statutory accounting contingency loss reserves in an amount equal to 50 of earned premiums. These amounts cannot be withdrawn for a period of 10 years, except as permitted by insurance regulations. With regulatory approval, a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35 of net premiums earned in a calendar year. Although MGIC holds assets in excess of its minimum statutory capital requirements and its PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of MGIC to pay dividends is restricted by insurance regulation. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. The level of ordinary dividends that may be paid without OCI approval is determined on an annual basis. A dividend is extraordinary when the proposed dividend amount, plus dividends paid in the twelve months preceding the dividend payment date exceed the ordinary dividend level. In 2023, MGIC can pay 92 million of ordinary dividends without OCI approval, before taking into consideration dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In 2022, MGIC paid 800 million in dividends of cash and investments to the holding company. For further information, see Note 14 Statutory Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 
 Mortgage insurance premium rates are subject to state regulation to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. Any increase in premium rates must be justified, generally on the basis of the insurer s loss experience, expenses and future trend

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

analysis. The general mortgage default experience may also be considered. Premium rates are subject to review and challenge by state regulators. 
 
 Mortgage insurers are generally single-line companies, restricted to writing residential mortgage insurance business only. Although we, as an insurance holding company, are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with MGIC or our other insurance subsidiaries without submission to and, in some instances, prior approval by applicable insurance departments, we are not subject to insurance company regulation on our non-insurance businesses. 
 
 Wisconsin s insurance regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of us unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the OCI. The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person owns or has the right to vote more than 10 of the voting securities. In addition, the insurance regulations of other states in which MGIC is licensed require notification to the state s insurance department a specified time before a person acquires control of us. If regulators in these states disapprove the change of control, our licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated. For further information about regulatory proceedings applicable to us and our industry, see We are subject to comprehensive regulation and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy in Item 1A . 
 
 The CFPB s rules implementing laws that require mortgage lenders to make ability-to-pay determinations prior to extending credit affect the characteristics of loans being originated and the volume of loans available to be insured. We are uncertain whether the CFPB will issue any other rules or regulations that affect our business. Such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 As the most significant purchasers and sellers of conventional mortgage loans and beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the GSEs impose financial and other requirements on private mortgage insurers in order for them to be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs (these requirements are referred to as the "PMIERs", as discussed above). These requirements are subject to change from time to time. Based on our interpretation of the financial requirements of the PMIERs, as of December 31, 2022, MGIC s Available Assets totaled 5.7 billion, or 2.3 billion in excess of its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our new business writings. For information about matters that could negatively affect our compliance with the PMIERs, see our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility in Item 1A . 
 
 The FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administrative action, in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. For more information about the business practices of the GSEs 

that impact our business, see our risk factor titled "Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses" in Item 1A 
 
 Indirect Regulation 
 We are also indirectly, but significantly, impacted by regulations affecting purchasers of mortgage loans, such as the GSEs, and regulations affecting governmental insurers, such as the FHA and the VA, and lenders. Private mortgage insurers, including MGIC, are highly dependent upon federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations to the extent they affect the demand for private mortgage insurance and the housing market generally. From time to time, those laws and regulations have been amended in ways that affect competition from government agencies. Proposals are discussed from time to time by Congress and certain federal agencies to reform or modify the FHA and the Government National Mortgage Association, which securitizes mortgages insured by the FHA. 
 
 Mortgage insurance generally may be considered to be a settlement service for purposes of RESPA under applicable regulations. Subject to certain exceptions, in general, RESPA prohibits any person from giving or receiving any thing of value pursuant to an agreement or understanding to refer settlement services. 
 
 HOPA provides for the automatic termination, or cancellation upon a borrower s request, of private mortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions. For more information, see "Our Products and Services" in Item 1.B. 
 
 FCRA imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information. FCRA has been interpreted by some Federal Trade Commission staff and federal courts to require mortgage insurance companies to provide adverse action notices to consumers in the event an application for mortgage insurance is declined or offered at less than the best available rate for the loan program applied for on the basis of a review of the consumer s credit. 
 
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have uniform guidelines on real estate lending by insured lending institutions under their supervision. The guidelines specify that a residential mortgage loan originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 90 or greater should have appropriate credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral, although no depth of coverage percentage is specified in the guidelines. 
 
 Lenders are subject to various laws, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA, HOPA, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, FCRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Fair Housing Act, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to various laws, including laws relating to government sponsored enterprises, which may impose obligations or create incentives for increased lending to low and moderate income persons, or in targeted areas. 
 
 There can be no assurance that other federal laws and regulations affecting these institutions and entities will not 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 24 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

change, or that new legislation or regulations will not be adopted which will adversely affect the private mortgage insurance industry. 

G. Human Capital 
 In 2022, we placed a significant focus on supporting co-workers in their career journey, and connecting co-workers to each other and the community from educating managers on hybrid team-building to curating dozens of volunteer opportunities. 
 The following table provides selected demographic information for our workforce as of December 31, 2022. 
 Demographics (as of December 31, 2022) Number of Co-Workers 683 Average Tenure 12 years Percent Female 56 Percent Racial / Ethnic Minorities 19 Turnover Rate 15 Average Age 48 
 The number of co-workers does not include on-call co-workers. The number of on-call co-workers can vary substantially, primarily as a result of changes in demand for contract underwriting services. In recent years, the number of on-call co-workers has ranged from fewer than 25 to more than 110. 
 
 Diversity, Equity Inclusion 
 In 2022 we established a DEI Executive Council, an internal group that consists of executive and cross-functional management that reports to the CEO and Corporate Sustainability Executive Council. The DEI Executive Council has undertaken a number of initiatives since its inception, including: 
 Recognizing eight DEI observance days through co-worker education, engagement and action 
 Launching DEI workshops and dialogue sessions for all MGIC officers 
 Prioritizing DEI in each all-company meeting and engaging executive leadership in ongoing advocacy and endorsement 
 
 Total Rewards and Talent Practices 
 Our total rewards program is designed to provide a competitive package of benefits and compensation elements that recognize the unique needs of our workforce and their families. All full-time MGIC co-workers are eligible to participate in our health program, which is calibrated toward well-being through our popular Health Rewards program in addition to a comprehensive medical, dental and vision plan. We also recognize financial health as part of well-being, and so currently provide a 401(k) plan with company match and discretionary annual profit-sharing contributions. In 2022, we made changes designed to deliver more flexibility to co-workers at all stages of their careers by shifting from a legacy pension plan to increase 401(k) matching, enhancing retiree medical benefits, and expanding our retirement eligibility. 
 Our talent practices reflect a commitment to creating a positive co-worker experience and investing in development and career growth. In 2022, we rolled out an end-to-end career framework aimed at strengthening our talent pool, promoting equity across departments, setting clear expectations based on role, and creating more opportunities for internal mobility. We also 

redesigned our annual bonus program to expand eligibility and give co-workers a greater opportunity to share in company success. 
 
 Co-Worker Sentiment 
 MGIC conducts an annual engagement survey to gauge co-worker sentiment. In 2022, we saw an 83 participation rate and added survey questions to gain deeper insight into co-worker inclusion and belonging. Based on the survey results, we identify and share with our Board of Directors and executive leadership several key areas of strength and opportunity. These strength and opportunities are shared with all co-workers for transparency, and leaders at all levels of the company are expected to play an active role in taking meaningful action in response. The annual engagement survey is complemented by additional quantitative, qualitative and passive listening mechanisms, ranging from new hire surveys to CEO-led focus groups. 
 
 Community Involvement 
 Our commitment to community is formalized under the banner of Giving Back, Together , and in 2022 included providing financial and in-kind support for organizations that support housing, youth programs, and the arts in our community and nationwide. We also provided paid time off for co-workers to volunteer or work at election polling places. 

H. Website Access 
 We make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with the SEC. The reports and amendments are accessible at the Reports Filings link on our website (http://mtg.mgic.com). The inclusion of our website address in this report is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this report.

PART I 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As used below, we, our and us refer to MGIC Investment Corporation s consolidated operations or to MGIC Investment Corporation, as the context requires; and MGIC refers to Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Global Events 
 The Russia-Ukraine war and/or other global events may adversely affect the U.S. economy and our business. 
 Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the already-elevated inflation rate, added more pressure to strained supply chains, and has increased volatility in the domestic and global financial markets. The war has impacted, and may impact, our business in various ways, including the following which are described in more detail in the remainder of these risk factors: 
 The terms under which we are able to obtain excess-of-loss ("XOL") reinsurance through the insurance-linked notes ("ILN") market and the traditional reinsurance market have been negatively impacted and terms under which we are able to access those markets in the future may be limited or less attractive. 
 The risk of a cybersecurity incident that affects our company may have increased. 
 An extended or broadened war may negatively impact the domestic economy, which may increase unemployment and inflation, or decrease home prices, in each case leading to an increase in loan delinquencies. 
 The volatility in the financial markets may impact the performance of our investment portfolio and our investment portfolio may include investments in companies or securities that are negatively impacted by the war. 
 Risk Factors Relating to the Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Regulation 
 Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns. 
 Losses result from events that reduce a borrower s ability or willingness to make mortgage payments, such as unemployment, health issues, changes in family status, and decreases in home prices that result in the borrower's mortgage balance exceeding the net value of the home. A deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in unemployment, generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect home prices. 
 High levels of unemployment may result in an increasing number of loan delinquencies and an increasing number of insurance claims; however, unemployment is difficult to predict given the uncertainty in the current market environment, including as a result of global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the possibility of an economic recession. Since the beginning of 2021, inflation has increased dramatically. The impact that higher inflation rates will have on loan delinquencies is unknown. 

The seasonally-adjusted Purchase-Only U.S. Home Price Index of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the FHFA ), which is based on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, indicates that home prices fell 0.1 nationwide in November, 2022 compared to October, 2022. The 12 month change in home prices remains at historically high rates, but the rate of growth is moderating: it increased by 6.7 in the first eleven months of 2022, after increasing 17.9 , 11.7 , and 5.9 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The national average price-to-income ratio exceeds its historical average, in part as a result of recent home price appreciation outpacing increases in income. Affordability issues and the significant increase in interest rates in recent months has put downward pressure on home prices. Recent third-party forecasts predict that home prices will decline further. This decline may occur even absent a deterioration in economic conditions due to declines in demand for homes, which in turn may result from changes in buyers perceptions of the potential for future appreciation, restrictions on and the cost of mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, higher interest rates, changes to the tax deductibility of mortgage interest, decreases in the rate of household formations, or other factors. 
 Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's ("the GSEs"), federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses. 
 The substantial majority of our NIW is for loans purchased by the GSEs; therefore, the business practices of the GSEs greatly impact our business. In June 2022 the GSEs each published their Equitable Housing Finance Plans. The Plans seek to advance equity in housing finance over a three year period and include potential changes to the GSEs business practices and policies. Specifically relating to mortgage insurance, (1) Fannie Mae s Plan contemplates the creation of special purchase credit program(s) ("SPCPs") targeted to historically underserved borrowers with a goal of lowering costs for such borrowers through lower than standard mortgage insurance requirements; and (2) Freddie Mac s Plan contemplates the creation of SPCPs targeted to historically underserved borrowers with the goals of (a) working with mortgage insurers to reduce costs for high LTV borrowers, and (b) updating mortgage insurance cancellation requirements. To the extent the business practices and policies of the GSEs regarding mortgage insurance coverage, costs and cancellation change, including more broadly than through SPCPs, such changes may negatively impact the mortgage insurance industry. 
 
 Other business practices of the GSEs that affect the mortgage insurance industry include: 
 The GSEs' private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements ("PMIERs"), the financial requirements of which are discussed in our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility. 
 The capital and collateral requirements for participants in the GSEs' alternative forms of credit enhancement discussed in 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 26 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

our risk factor titled "The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance." 
 The level of private mortgage insurance coverage, subject to the limitations of the GSEs charters, when private mortgage insurance is used as the required credit enhancement on low down payment mortgages (the GSEs generally require a level of mortgage insurance coverage that is higher than the level of coverage required by their charters; any change in the required level of coverage will impact our new risk written). 
 The amount of loan level price adjustments and guaranty fees (which result in higher costs to borrowers) that the GSEs assess on loans that require private mortgage insurance. The requirements of the new GSE capital framework may lead the GSEs to increase their guaranty fees. In addition, the FHFA has indicated that it is reviewing the GSEs' pricing in connection with preparing them to exit conservatorship and to ensure that pricing subsidies benefit only affordable housing activities. 
 Whether the GSEs select or influence the mortgage lender s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage. 
 The underwriting standards that determine which loans are eligible for purchase by the GSEs, which can affect the quality of the risk insured by the mortgage insurer and the availability of mortgage loans. 
 The terms on which mortgage insurance coverage can be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law and the business practices associated with such cancellations. For more information, see the above discussion of the GSEs' Equitable Housing Plans and our risk factor titled Changes in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force . 
 The programs established by the GSEs intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages and the circumstances in which mortgage servicers must implement such programs. 
 The terms that the GSEs require to be included in mortgage insurance policies for loans that they purchase, including limitations on the rescission rights of mortgage insurers. 
 The extent to which the GSEs intervene in mortgage insurers claims paying practices, rescission practices or rescission settlement practices with lenders. 
 The maximum loan limits of the GSEs compared to those of the FHA and other investors. 
 The benchmarks established by the FHFA for loans to be purchased by the GSEs, which can affect the loans available to be insured. In December 2021, the FHFA established the benchmark levels for 2022-2024 purchases of low-income home mortgages, very low-income home mortgages and low-income refinance mortgages, each of which exceeded the 2021 benchmarks. The FHFA also established two new sub-goals: one targeting minority communities and the other targeting low-income neighborhoods. 
 The FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the 

residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorships may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administrative action, in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. 
 It is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business of any resulting changes are uncertain. Many of the proposed changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. 
 We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility. 
 We must comply with a GSE's PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by that GSE. The PMIERs include financial requirements, as well as business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s Available Assets (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its Minimum Required Assets (which are generally based on an insurer s book of risk in force and calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions, reduced for credit given for risk ceded under reinsurance agreements). 
 Based on our interpretation of the PMIERs, as of December 31, 2022, MGIC s Available Assets totaled 5.7 billion, or 2.3 billion in excess of its Minimum Required Assets. MGIC is in compliance with the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. Our "Minimum Required Assets" reflect a credit for risk ceded under our quota share reinsurance ("QSR") and XOL reinsurance transactions, which are discussed in our risk factor titled "The mix of business we write affects our Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, our premium yields and the likelihood of losses occurring." The calculated credit for XOL reinsurance transactions under PMIERs is generally based on the PMIERs requirement of the covered loans and the attachment and detachment points of the coverage, all of which fluctuate over time. PMIERs credit is generally not given for the reinsured risk above the PMIERs requirement. The GSEs have discretion to further limit reinsurance credit under the PMIERs. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations Reinsurance Transactions in Part 7 for information about the calculated PMIERs credit for our XOL transactions. There is a risk we will not receive our current level of credit in future periods for ceded risk. In addition, we may not receive the same level of credit under future reinsurance transactions that we receive under existing transactions. If MGIC is not allowed certain levels of credit under the PMIERs, under certain circumstances, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions without penalty. 
 The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. If the number of loan delinquencies increases for reasons discussed in these risk factors, or otherwise, it may cause our Minimum Required Assets to exceed 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 27 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

our Available Assets. We are unable to predict the ultimate number of loans that will become delinquent. 
 If our Available Assets fall below our Minimum Required Assets, we would not be in compliance with the PMIERs. The PMIERs provide a list of remediation actions for a mortgage insurer's non-compliance, with additional actions possible in the GSEs' discretion. At the extreme, the GSEs may suspend or terminate our eligibility to insure loans purchased by them. Such suspension or termination would significantly reduce the volume of our new insurance written ("NIW"), the substantial majority of which is for loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. In addition to the increase in Minimum Required Assets associated with delinquent loans, factors that may negatively impact MGIC s ability to continue to comply with the financial requirements of the PMIERs include the following: 
 The GSEs may make the PMIERs more onerous in the future. The PMIERs provide that the factors that determine Minimum Required Assets will be updated periodically, or as needed if there is a significant change in macroeconomic conditions or loan performance. We do not anticipate that the regular periodic updates will occur more frequently than once every two years. The PMIERs state that the GSEs will provide notice 180 days prior to the effective date of updates to the factors; however, the GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time, including by imposing restrictions specific to our company. 
 The PMIERs may be changed in response to the final regulatory capital framework for the GSEs that was published in February 2022. 
 Our future operating results may be negatively impacted by the matters discussed in the rest of these risk factors. Such matters could decrease our revenues, increase our losses or require the use of assets, thereby creating a shortfall in Available Assets. 
 Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources, including for repayment of debt. 
 Because loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, paid claims may be substantially different than our loss reserves. 
 When we establish case reserves, we estimate our ultimate loss on delinquent loans by estimating the number of such loans that will result in a claim payment (the "claim rate"), and further estimating the amount of the claim payment (the "claim severity"). Changes to our claim rate and claim severity estimates could have a material impact on our future results, even in a stable economic environment. Our estimates incorporate anticipated cures, loss mitigation activity, rescissions and curtailments. The establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Our actual claim payments may differ substantially from our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be affected by several factors, including a change in regional or national economic conditions as discussed in these risk factors and a change in the length of time loans are delinquent before claims are received. Generally, the longer a loan is delinquent before a claim is received, the greater the severity. As a result of foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance programs related to COVID-19, the average time it takes to receive claims has increased. Economic conditions may differ from region to region. Information about the geographic 

dispersion of our risk in force and delinquency inventory can be found in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, losses incurred generally followed a seasonal trend in which the second half of the year has weaker credit performance than the first half, with higher new default notice activity and a lower cure rate. 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy. 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation, including by state insurance departments. Many regulations are designed for the protection of our insured policyholders and consumers, rather than for the benefit of investors. Mortgage insurers, including MGIC, have in the past been involved in litigation and regulatory actions related to alleged violations of the anti-referral fee provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA"), and the notice provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"). While these proceedings in the aggregate did not result in material liability for MGIC, there can be no assurance that the outcome of future proceedings, if any, under these laws or others would not have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent that we are construed to make independent credit decisions in connection with our contract underwriting activities, we also could be subject to increased regulatory requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA"), FCRA, and other laws. Under relevant laws, examination may also be made of whether a mortgage insurer's underwriting decisions have a disparate impact on persons belonging to a protected class in violation of the law. 
 Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including payment for the referral of insurance business, premium rates and discrimination in pricing, and minimum capital requirements. The increased use, by the private mortgage insurance industry, of risk-based pricing systems that establish premium rates based on more attributes than previously considered, and of algorithms, artificial intelligence and data and analytics, has led to additional regulatory scrutiny of premium rates and of other matters such as discrimination in pricing and underwriting, data privacy and access to insurance. For more information about state capital requirements, see our risk factor titled State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis . For information about regulation of data privacy, see our risk factor titled We could be materially adversely affected by a cyber security breach or failure of information security controls . For more details about the various ways in which our subsidiaries are regulated, see Business - Regulation in Item 1. 
 While we have established policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many such laws and regulations are complex and it is not possible to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of any reviews or investigations nor is it possible to predict their effect on us or the mortgage insurance industry.

Pandemics, hurricanes and other natural disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs. 
 Pandemics and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires and floods, or other events related to changing climatic conditions, could trigger an economic downturn in the affected areas, or in areas with similar risks, which could result in a decline in our business and an increased claim rate on policies in those areas. Natural disasters, rising sea levels and/or fresh water shortages could lead to a decrease in home prices in the affected areas, or in areas with similar risks, which could result in an increase in claim severity on policies in those areas. In addition, the inability of a borrower to obtain hazard and/or flood insurance, or the increased cost of such insurance, could lead to an increase in delinquencies or a decrease in home prices in the affected areas. If we were to attempt to limit our new insurance written in affected areas, lenders may be unwilling to procure insurance from us anywhere. 
 Pandemics and other natural disasters could also lead to increased reinsurance rates or reduced availability of reinsurance. This may cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain and could negatively affect our compliance with the financial requirements of State Capital Requirements and the PMIERs. 
 The PMIERs require us to maintain significantly more "Minimum Required Assets" for delinquent loans than for performing loans; however, the increase in Minimum Required Assets is not as great for certain delinquent loans in areas that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has declared major disaster areas and for certain loans whose borrowers have been affected by COVID-19. See our risk factor titled "We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility." 
 In January 2021, the FHFA issued a Request for Input RFI regarding Climate and Natural Disaster Risk Management at the Regulated Entities (i.e., the GSEs and the Federal Home Loan Banks). The FHFA has instructed the GSEs to designate climate change as a priority concern and actively consider its effects in their decision making. It is possible that efforts to manage this risk by the FHFA, GSEs (including through GSE guideline or mortgage insurance policy changes) or others could materially impact the volume and characteristics of our NIW (including its policy terms), home prices in certain areas and defaults by borrowers in certain areas. 
 Reinsurance may not always be available or its cost may increase. 
 We have in place QSR and XOL reinsurance transactions providing various amounts of coverage on 85 of our risk in force as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Part 8, Note 9 Reinsurance and Part 7 Consolidated Results of Operations Reinsurance Transactions for more information about coverage under our reinsurance transactions. The reinsurance transactions reduce the tail-risk associated with stress scenarios. As a result, they reduce the capital that we are required to hold to support the risk and they allow us to earn higher returns on our business than we would without them. However, reinsurance may not always be available to us or available on similar terms, the reinsurance transactions subject us to counterparty credit risk, and the GSEs may change the credit they allow under the PMIERs for risk ceded 

under our reinsurance transactions. Most of our XOL transactions were entered into in capital market transactions with special purpose insurers that issued notes linked to the reinsurance coverage ("Insurance Linked Notes" or "ILNs"). Our access to reinsurance may be disrupted and the terms under which we are able to obtain reinsurance may be less attractive than in the past due to volatility stemming from circumstances such as higher interest rates, increased inflation, global events such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and other factors. In 2022, execution of transactions for XOL reinsurance through the ILN market was more challenging, with increased pricing, down-sized transactions, and generally fewer transactions executed by mortgage insurers. If we are unable to obtain reinsurance for our insurance written, the capital required to support our insurance written will not be reduced as discussed above and our returns may decrease absent an increase in our premium rates. An increase in our premium rates may lead to a decrease in our NIW. 
 
 Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods. 
 In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we establish case reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses only when delinquency notices are received for insured loans that are two or more payments past due and for loans we estimate are delinquent but for which delinquency notices have not yet been received (which we include in IBNR ). Losses that may occur from loans that are not delinquent are not reflected in our financial statements, except when a "premium deficiency" is recorded. A premium deficiency would be recorded if the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premiums and already established loss reserves on the applicable loans. As a result, future losses incurred on loans that are not currently delinquent may have a material impact on future results as delinquencies emerge. As of December 31, 2022, we had established case reserves and reported losses incurred for 26,387 loans in our delinquency inventory and our IBNR reserve totaled 21 million. The number of loans in our delinquency inventory may increase from that level as a result of economic conditions relating to current global events or other factors and our losses incurred may increase. 
 State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis. 
 The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, MGIC's domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its risk in force (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position MPP ). MGIC's policyholder position includes its net worth or surplus, and its contingency reserve.

At December 31, 2022 MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was 10.2 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was 3.5 billion above the required MPP of 2.1 billion. Our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP reflect full credit for the risk ceded under our quota share reinsurance and excess of loss transactions in the ILN market and traditional reinsurance market with unaffiliated reinsurers . It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded under such transactions. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under the State Capital Requirements, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions, without penalty. 
 The NAIC previously announced plans to revise the State Capital Requirements that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. In December 2019, a working group of state regulators released an exposure draft of a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act and a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although certain items were not completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk and minimum capital floors. In October 2022, the NAIC working group released a revised exposure draft of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act that does not include changes to the capital requirements of the existing Model Act. 
 While MGIC currently meets the State Capital Requirements of Wisconsin and all other jurisdictions, it could be prevented from writing new business in the future in all jurisdictions if it fails to meet the State Capital Requirements of Wisconsin, or it could be prevented from writing new business in a particular jurisdiction if it fails to meet the State Capital Requirements of that jurisdiction, and in each case if MGIC does not obtain a waiver of such requirements. It is possible that regulatory action by one or more jurisdictions, including those that do not have specific State Capital Requirements, may prevent MGIC from continuing to write new insurance in such jurisdictions. If we are unable to write business in a particular jurisdiction, lenders may be unwilling to procure insurance from us anywhere. In addition, a lender s assessment of the future ability of our insurance operations to meet the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs may affect its willingness to procure insurance from us. In this regard, see our risk factor titled Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses. A possible future failure by MGIC to meet the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs will not necessarily mean that MGIC lacks sufficient resources to pay claims on its insurance liabilities. You should read the rest of these risk factors for information about matters that could negatively affect MGIC s compliance with State Capital Requirements and its claims paying resources. 
 If the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines, the amount of insurance that we write could decline. 
 The factors that may affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include the health of the U.S. economy, conditions in regional and local economies and the level of consumer confidence; restrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, liquidity issues or risk-retention and/or capital requirements affecting lenders; the level of home mortgage interest rates; housing affordability; new and existing housing availability; the rate of household formation, which is influenced, in part, by population and immigration trends; 

homeownership rates; the rate of home price appreciation, which in times of heavy refinancing can affect whether refinanced loans have LTV ratios that require private mortgage insurance; and government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers. A decline in the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations could decrease demand for mortgage insurance and limit our NIW. For other factors that could decrease the demand for mortgage insurance, see our risk factor titled The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance. 
 The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance. 
 Alternatives to private mortgage insurance include: 
 investors using risk mitigation and credit risk transfer techniques other than private mortgage insurance, or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement, 
 lenders and other investors holding mortgages in portfolio and self-insuring, 
 lenders using Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") and other government mortgage insurance programs, and 
 lenders originating mortgages using piggyback structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first mortgage with an 80 loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio and a second mortgage with a 10 , 15 or 20 LTV ratio rather than a first mortgage with a 90 , 95 or 100 LTV ratio that has private mortgage insurance. 
 The GSEs charters generally require credit enhancement for a low down payment mortgage loan (a loan in an amount that exceeds 80 of a home s value) in order for such loan to be eligible for purchase by the GSEs. Private mortgage insurance generally has been purchased by lenders in primary mortgage market transactions to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. In 2018, the GSEs initiated secondary mortgage market programs with loan level mortgage default coverage provided by various (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers governed by PMIERs, and that are not selected by the lenders. These programs, which currently account for a small percentage of the low down payment market, compete with traditional private mortgage insurance and, due to differences in policy terms, they may offer premium rates that are below prevalent single premium lender-paid mortgage insurance ("LPMI") rates. We participate in these programs from time to time. See our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's ("the GSEs"), federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses for a discussion of various business practices of the GSEs that may be changed, including through expansion or modification of these programs. 
 The GSEs (and other investors) have also used other forms of credit enhancement that did not involve traditional private mortgage insurance, such as engaging in credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors, including competitors and an affiliate of MGIC; using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction

with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage; or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement. 
 The FHA's share of the low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance was 26.7 in 2022, 24.7 in 2021, and 23.4 in 2020. Beginning in 2012, the FHA s share has been as low as 23.4 (in 2020) and as high as 42.1 (in 2012). Factors that influence the FHA s market share include relative rates and fees, underwriting guidelines and loan limits of the FHA, VA, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs; lenders' perceptions of legal risks under FHA versus GSE programs; flexibility for the FHA to establish new products as a result of federal legislation and programs; returns expected to be obtained by lenders for Ginnie Mae securitization of FHA-insured loans compared to those obtained from selling loans to the GSEs for securitization; and differences in policy terms, such as the ability of a borrower to cancel insurance coverage under certain circumstances. On February 22, 2023, the FHA announced a 30 bps decrease in its mortgage insurance premium rates. This rate reduction will negatively impact our NIW; however, given the many factors that influence the FHA's market share, it is difficult to predict the extent of the impact. In addition, we cannot predict how the factors that affect the FHA s share of new insurance written will change in the future. 
 
 The VA's share of the low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA, USDA or primary private mortgage insurance was 24.5 in 2022, 30.2 in 2021, and 30.9 in 2020. Beginning in 2012, the VA s share has been as low as 22.8 (in 2013) and as high as 30.9 (in 2020). We believe that the VA s market share grows as the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA s program increases, and when eligible borrowers opt to use the VA program when refinancing their mortgages. The VA program offers 100 LTV ratio loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount. 
 Changes in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force. 
 The premium from a single premium policy is collected upfront and generally earned over the estimated life of the policy. In contrast, premiums from monthly and annual premium policies are received each month or year, as applicable, and earned each month over the life of the policy. In each year, most of our premiums earned are from insurance that has been written in prior years. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in force, which is generally measured by persistency (the percentage of our insurance remaining in force from one year prior), is a significant determinant of our revenues. A higher than expected persistency rate may decrease the profitability from single premium policies because they will remain in force longer and may increase the incidence of claims that was estimated when the policies were written. A low persistency rate on monthly and annual premium policies will reduce future premiums but may also reduce the incidence of claims, while a high persistency on those policies will increase future premiums but may increase the incidence of claims. 
 Our persistency rate was 79.8 at December 31, 2022, 62.6 at December 31, 2021, and 60.5 at December 31, 2020. Since 2000, our year-end persistency ranged from a high of 84.7 at December 31, 2009 to a low of 47.1 at December 31, 2003. Our persistency rate is primarily affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on our insurance in force, which affects the vulnerability of the 

insurance in force to refinancing; and the current amount of equity that borrowers have in the homes underlying our insurance in force. The amount of equity affects persistency in the following ways: 
 Borrowers with significant equity may be able to refinance their loans without requiring mortgage insurance. 
 The Homeowners Protection Act HOPA requires servicers to cancel mortgage insurance when a borrower s LTV ratio meets or is scheduled to meet certain levels, generally based on the original value of the home and subject to various conditions. 
 The GSEs mortgage insurance cancellation guidelines apply more broadly than HOPA and also consider a home s current value. For more information about the GSEs guidelines and business practices, and how they may change, see our risk factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's ("the GSEs") , federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses. 
 We are susceptible to disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans that we insure and we rely on third-party reporting for information regarding the mortgage loans we insure. 
 We depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. An increase in delinquent loans may result in liquidity issues for servicers. When a mortgage loan that is collateral for a mortgage backed security ("MBS") becomes delinquent, the servicer is usually required to continue to pay principal and interest to the MBS investors, generally for four months, even though the servicer is not receiving payments from borrowers. This may cause liquidity issues, especially for non-bank servicers (who service approximately 46 of the loans underlying our insurance in force as of December 31, 2022) because they do not have the same sources of liquidity that bank servicers have. 
 While there has been no disruption in our premium receipts through the end of 2022, servicers who experience future liquidity issues may be less likely to advance premiums to us on policies covering delinquent loans or to remit premiums on policies covering loans that are not delinquent. Our policies generally allow us to cancel coverage on loans that are not delinquent if the premiums are not paid within a grace period. 
 An increase in delinquent loans or a transfer of servicing resulting from liquidity issues, may increase the operational burden on servicers, cause a disruption in the servicing of delinquent loans and reduce servicers abilities to undertake mitigation efforts that could help limit our losses. 
 The information presented in this report and on our website with respect to the mortgage loans we insure is based on information reported to us by third parties, including the servicers and originators of the mortgage loans, and information presented may be subject to lapses or inaccuracies in reporting from such third parties. In many cases, we may not be aware that information reported to us is incorrect until such time as a claim is made against us under the relevant insurance policy. We do not consistently receive monthly policy status information from servicers for single premium policies, and may not be aware that the mortgage loans insured by such policies have been repaid. We periodically attempt to determine if coverage is still in force on 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 31 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

such policies by asking the last servicer of record or through the periodic reconciliation of loan information with certain servicers. It may be possible that our reports continue to reflect, as active, policies on mortgage loans that have been repaid. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Generally 
 If our risk management programs are not effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face, or if the models used in our businesses are inaccurate, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our enterprise risk management program, described in "Business - Our Products and Services - Risk Management" in Item 1, may not be effective in identifying, or adequate in controlling or mitigating, the risks we face in our business. 
 We employ proprietary and third-party models for a wide range of purposes, including the following: projecting losses, premiums, expenses, and returns; pricing products (through our risk-based pricing system); determining the techniques used to underwrite insurance; estimating reserves; evaluating risk; determining internal capital requirements; and performing stress testing. These models rely on estimates, projections, and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may not always operate as intended. This can be especially true when extraordinary events occur, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, periods of extreme inflation, or environmental disasters related to changing climatic conditions. In addition, our models are being continuously updated over time. Changes in models or model assumptions could lead to material changes in our future expectations, returns, or financial results. The models we employ are complex, which could increase our risk of error in their design, implementation, or use. Also, the associated input data, assumptions, and calculations may not always be correct or accurate and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks may not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models may increase when we change assumptions, methodologies, or modeling platforms. Moreover, we may use information we receive through enhancements to refine or otherwise change existing assumptions and/or methodologies. 
 
 Information technology system failures or interruptions may materially impact our operations and adversely affect our financial results. 
 We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems to conduct our business. Our ability to efficiently operate our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our systems and technology. The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively could affect our ability to provide our products and services to customers, reduce efficiency, or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems. We are also dependent on our ongoing relationships with key technology providers, including provisioning of their products and technologies, and their ability to support those products and technologies. The inability of these providers to successfully provide and support those products could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 We are in the process of upgrading certain information systems, and transforming and automating certain business processes, and we continue to enhance our risk-based pricing system and our system for evaluating risk. Certain information systems have 

been in place for a number of years and it has become increasingly difficult to support their operation. The implementation of technological and business process improvements, as well as their integration with customer and third-party systems when applicable, is complex, expensive and time consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement and integrate the new technology systems, if the third party providers upon which we are reliant do not perform as expected, if our legacy systems fail to operate as required, or if the upgraded systems and/or transformed and automated business processes do not operate as expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations. 
 We could be materially adversely affected by a cyber security breach or failure of information security controls. 
 As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential and proprietary information, including personal information of consumers and employees, on our servers and those of cloud computing services. Federal and state laws designed to promote the protection of such information require businesses that collect or maintain personal information to adopt information security programs, and to notify individuals, and in some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities, of security breaches involving personally identifiable information. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including by cyber attacks, such as those involving ransomware. The Company discovers vulnerabilities and regularly blocks a high volume of attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that will hinder the Company s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. Such attacks may also increase as a result of retaliation by Russia in response to actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in connection with Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. The Company operates under a hybrid workforce model and such model may be more vulnerable to security breaches. 
 
 While we have information security policies and systems in place to secure our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive information, there can be no assurance with respect to our systems and those of our third-party vendors that unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the sensitive information, either through the actions of third parties or employees, will not occur. Due to our reliance on information technology systems, including ours and those of our customers and third-party service providers, and to the sensitivity of the information that we maintain, unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the information could adversely affect our reputation, severely disrupt our operations, result in a loss of business and expose us to material claims for damages and may require that we provide free credit monitoring services to individuals affected by a security breach. 
 
 Should we experience an unauthorized disclosure of information or a cyber attack, including those involving ransomware, some of the costs we incur may not be recoverable through insurance, or legal or other processes, and this may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 32 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

The mix of business we write affects our Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, our premium yields and the likelihood of losses occurring. 
 The Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs are, in part, a function of the direct risk-in-force and the risk profile of the loans we insure, considering LTV ratio, credit score, vintage, Home Affordable Refinance Program ("HARP") status and delinquency status; and whether the loans were insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies or other policies that are not subject to automatic termination consistent with the Homeowners Protection Act requirements for borrower-paid mortgage insurance. Therefore, if our direct risk-in-force increases through increases in NIW, or if our mix of business changes to include loans with higher LTV ratios or lower FICO scores, for example, all other things equal, we will be required to hold more Available Assets in order to maintain GSE eligibility. 
 The percentage of our NIW from all single premium policies was 4.3 in 2022 and 7.4 in 2021, and has ranged from 4.3 in 2022 to 19.0 in 2017. Depending on the actual life of a single premium policy and its premium rate relative to that of a monthly premium policy, a single premium policy may generate more or less premium than a monthly premium policy over its life. 
 As discussed in our risk factor titled " Reinsurance may not always be available or its cost may increase," we have in place various QSR transactions. Although the transactions reduce our premiums, they have a lesser impact on our overall results, as losses ceded under the transactions reduce our losses incurred and the ceding commissions we receive reduce our underwriting expenses. The effect of the QSR transactions on the various components of pre-tax income will vary from period to period, depending on the level of ceded losses incurred. We also have in place various XOL reinsurance transactions under which we cede premiums. Under the XOL reinsurance transactions, for the respective reinsurance coverage periods, we retain the first layer of aggregate losses and the reinsurers provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. 
 In addition to the effect of reinsurance on our premiums, we expect a decline in our premium yield because an increasing percentage of our insurance in force is from recent book years whose premium rates had been trending lower. 
 Our ability to rescind insurance coverage became more limited for new insurance written beginning in mid-2012, and it became further limited for new insurance written under our revised master policy that became effective March 1, 2020. These limitations may result in higher losses paid than would be the case under our previous master policies. In addition, our rescission rights temporarily have become more limited due to accommodations we made in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We waived our rescission rights in certain circumstances where the failure to make payments was associated with a COVID-19 pandemic-related forbearance. 
 From time to time, in response to market conditions, we change the types of loans that we insure. We also may change our underwriting guidelines, including by agreeing with certain approval recommendations from a GSE automated underwriting system. We also make exceptions to our underwriting requirements on a loan-by-loan basis and for certain customer programs. Our underwriting requirements are available on our website at http://www.mgic.com/underwriting/index.html. 

Even when home prices are stable or rising, mortgages with certain characteristics have higher probabilities of claims. As of December 31, 2022, mortgages with these characteristics in our primary risk in force included mortgages with LTV ratios greater than 95 (15.0 ), mortgages with borrowers having FICO scores below 680 (7.2 ), including those with borrowers having FICO scores of 620-679 (6.2 ), mortgages with limited underwriting, including limited borrower documentation (0.8 ), and mortgages with borrowers having DTI ratios greater than 45 (or where no ratio is available) (15.6 ), each attribute as determined at the time of loan origination. Loans with more than one of these attributes accounted for 4.4 of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2022, and 4.1 of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2021. When home prices increase, interest rates increase and/or the percentage of our NIW from purchase transactions increases, our NIW on mortgages with higher LTV ratios and higher DTI ratios may increase. Our NIW on mortgages with LTV ratios greater than 95 increased from 11 in 2021 to 12 in 2022 and our NIW on mortgages with DTI ratios greater than 45 increased from 14 in 2021 to 21 in 2022. 
 
 From time to time, we change the processes we use to underwrite loans. For example: we rely on information provided to us by lenders that was obtained from certain of the GSEs automated appraisal and income verification tools, which may produce results that differ from the results that would have been determined using different methods; we accept GSE appraisal waivers for certain refinance loans, the numbers of which have increased significantly beginning in 2020; and we accept GSE appraisal flexibilities that allow property valuations in certain transactions to be based on appraisals that do not involve an onsite or interior inspection of the property. Our acceptance of automated GSE appraisal and income verification tools, GSE appraisal waivers and GSE appraisal flexibilities may affect our pricing and risk assessment. We also continue to further automate our underwriting processes and it is possible that our automated processes result in our insuring loans that we would not otherwise have insured under our prior processes. 
 Approximately 72 of our 2022 and 72 of our 2021 NIW was originated under delegated underwriting programs pursuant to which the loan originators had authority on our behalf to underwrite the loans for our mortgage insurance. For loans originated through a delegated underwriting program, we depend on the originators' compliance with our guidelines and rely on the originators' representations that the loans being insured satisfy the underwriting guidelines, eligibility criteria and other requirements. While we have established systems and processes to monitor whether certain aspects of our underwriting guidelines were being followed by the originators, such systems may not ensure that the guidelines were being strictly followed at the time the loans were originated. 
 The widespread use of risk-based pricing systems by the private mortgage insurance industry (discussed in our risk factor titled "Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and / or increase our losses" makes it more difficult to compare our premium rates to those offered by our competitors. We may not be aware of industry rate changes until we observe that our mix of new insurance written has changed and our mix may fluctuate more as a result. 
 If state or federal regulations or statutes are changed in ways that ease mortgage lending standards and/or requirements, or if 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 33 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

lenders seek ways to replace business in times of lower mortgage originations, it is possible that more mortgage loans could be originated with higher risk characteristics than are currently being originated, such as loans with lower FICO scores and higher DTI ratios. The focus of the new FHFA leadership on increasing homeownership opportunities for borrowers is likely to have this effect. Lenders could pressure mortgage insurers to insure such loans, which are expected to experience higher claim rates. Although we attempt to incorporate these higher expected claim rates into our underwriting and pricing models, there can be no assurance that the premiums earned and the associated investment income will be adequate to compensate for actual losses paid even under our current underwriting requirements. 
 The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liabilities for losses and as a result any inadequacy could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 When we set our premiums at policy issuance, we have expectations regarding likely performance of the insured risks over the long term. Generally, we cannot cancel mortgage insurance coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of a policy. As a result, higher than anticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by our non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. Our premiums are subject to approval by state regulatory agencies, which can delay or limit our ability to increase premiums on future policies. In addition, our customized rate plans may delay our ability to increase premiums on future policies covered by such plans. The premiums we charge, the investment income we earn and the amount of reinsurance we carry may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage provided to customers. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipated when we set the premiums, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our premium rates are also based in part on the amount of capital we are required to hold against the insured risk. If the amount of capital we are required to hold increases from the amount we were required to hold when we set the premiums, our returns may be lower than we assumed. For a discussion of the amount of capital we are required to hold, see our risk factor titled " We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility ." 
 We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements. 
 Our success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our aging workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals; that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us; or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. We currently have not entered into any employment agreements with our officers or key personnel. Volatility or lack of performance in 

our stock price may affect our ability to retain our key personnel or attract replacements should key personnel depart. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including productivity costs and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings. 
 Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and / or increase our losses. 
 The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. We believe we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on premium rates, underwriting requirements, financial strength (including based on credit or financial strength ratings), customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, strength of management teams and field organizations, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders, and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. 
 Our relationships with our customers, which may affect the amount of our NIW, could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including if our premium rates are higher than those of our competitors, our underwriting requirements are more restrictive than those of our competitors, or our customers are dissatisfied with our claims-paying practices (including insurance policy rescissions and claim curtailments). 
 In recent years, the industry has materially reduced its use of standard rate cards, which were fairly consistent among competitors, and correspondingly increased its use of (i) pricing systems that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters, and (ii) customized rate plans, both of which typically have rates lower than the standard rate card. Our increased use of reinsurance over the past several years, and the improved credit profile and reduced loss expectations associated with loans insured after 2008, have helped to mitigate the negative effect of declining premium rates on our expected returns. However, refer to our risk factor titled "Reinsurance may not always be available or its cost may increase" for a discussion of the risks associated with the availability of reinsurance, and our risk factors titled Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns , and Pandemics, hurricanes and other natural disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs for a discussion about risks associated with our NIW. 
 The widespread use of risk-based pricing systems by the private mortgage insurance industry makes it more difficult to compare our rates to those offered by our competitors. We may not be aware of industry rate changes until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. In addition, business under customized rate plans is awarded by certain customers for only limited periods of time. As a result, our NIW may fluctuate more than it had in the past. Regarding the concentration of our new business, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 33 and 36 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in developing our pricing strategies. Premium 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 34 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

rates on NIW will change our premium yield (net premiums earned divided by the average insurance in force) over time as older insurance policies run off and new insurance policies with premium rates that are generally lower are written. 
 Certain of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than we do (including, through off-shore intercompany reinsurance vehicles, which have tax advantages that may increase if U.S. corporate income taxes increase). As a result, they may be able to achieve higher after-tax rates of return on their NIW compared to us, which could allow them to leverage reduced premium rates to gain market share, and they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including by participating in alternative forms of credit enhancement pursued by the GSEs discussed in our risk factor titled "The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance ." 
 Although the current PMIERs of the GSEs do not require an insurer to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, our financial strength ratings can affect us in the ways set forth below. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our insurance subsidiaries, our future NIW could be negatively affected. 
 A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in increased scrutiny of our financial condition by the GSEs and/or our customers, potentially resulting in a decrease in the amount of our NIW. 
 Our ability to participate in the non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securities market (the size of which has been limited since 2008, but may grow in the future), could depend on our ability to maintain and improve our investment grade ratings for our insurance subsidiaries. We could be competitively disadvantaged with some market participants because the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are lower than those of some competitors. MGIC's financial strength rating from A.M. Best is A- (with a stable outlook), from Moody s is A3 (with a stable outlook) and from Standard Poor s is BBB+ (with a stable outlook) . 
 Financial strength ratings may also play a greater role if the GSEs no longer operate in their current capacities, for example, due to legislative or regulatory action. In addition, although the PMIERs do not require minimum financial strength ratings, the GSEs consider financial strength ratings to be important when using forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance, as discussed in our risk factor titled " The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance." The final GSE capital framework provides more capital credit for transactions with higher rated counterparties, as well as those who are diversified. Although we are currently unaware of a direct impact on MGIC, this could potentially become a competitive disadvantage in the future. 

Standard Poor s is considering changes to its rating methodologies for insurers, including mortgage insurers. It is uncertain what impact the changes will have, whether they will prompt similar moves at other rating agencies, or the extent to which they will impact how external parties evaluate the different rating levels. 
 
 We are subject to the risk of legal proceedings. 
 Before paying an insurance claim, generally we review the loan and servicing files to determine the appropriateness of the claim amount. When reviewing the files, we may determine that we have the right to rescind coverage or deny a claim on the loan (both referred to herein as rescissions ). In addition, our insurance policies generally provide that we can reduce a claim if the servicer did not comply with its obligations under our insurance policy (such reduction referred to as a curtailment ). In recent years, an immaterial percentage of claims received have been resolved by rescissions. In 2022 and in 2021, curtailments reduced our average claim paid by approximately 6.3 and 4.4 , respectively. The COVID-19-related foreclosure moratoriums and forbearance plans, along with increased home prices, resulted in decreased claims paid activity beginning in the second quarter of 2020. It is difficult to predict the level of curtailments once foreclosure activity returns to a more typical level. Our loss reserving methodology incorporates our estimates of future rescissions, curtailments, and reversals of rescissions and curtailments. A variance between ultimate actual rescission, curtailment and reversal rates and our estimates, as a result of the outcome of litigation, settlements or other factors, could materially affect our losses. 
 When the insured disputes our right to rescind coverage or curtail claims, we generally engage in discussions in an attempt to settle the dispute. If we are unable to reach a settlement, the outcome of a dispute ultimately may be determined by legal proceedings. Under ASC 450-20, until a loss associated with settlement discussions or legal proceedings becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated, we consider our claim payment or rescission resolved for financial reporting purposes and do not accrue an estimated loss. When we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we record our best estimate of our probable loss. In those cases, until settlement negotiations or legal proceedings are concluded (including the receipt of any necessary GSE approvals), it is possible that we will record an additional loss. 
 We have been named as a third-party defendant in a lawsuit that involves refunds of mortgage insurance premiums under the Homeowners Protection Act. We are monitoring litigation addressing similar issues in which we have not been named a defendant. We are unable to assess the potential impact of any such litigation at this time. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in other disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, based on the facts known at this time, the ultimate resolution of these ordinary course disputes and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our business and future financial condition. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted our 2020 financial results. While the initial impact of COVID-19 on our business has moderated, the extent to which COVID-19 may materially impact our business and future financial condition is uncertain and 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 35 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

cannot be predicted. The magnitude of any future impact could be influenced by various factors, including the length and severity of the pandemic in the United States, efforts to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, the level of unemployment, government initiatives and actions taken by the GSEs (including mortgage forbearance and modification programs), and the overall effects of COVID-19 on the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business in other ways, as described in more detail in these risk factors. 
 
 Forbearance for borrowers who were affected by COVID-19 allows mortgage payments to be suspended for a period of time. Historically, forbearance plans have reduced the incidence of our losses on affected loans. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic impact of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the ultimate effect of COVID-19 related forbearances on our loss incidence. Whether a loan delinquency will cure, including through modification, when forbearance ends will depend on the economic circumstances of the borrower at that time. The severity of losses associated with delinquencies that do not cure will depend on economic conditions at that time, including home prices. 
 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio. 
 Our investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment portfolio is affected by general economic conditions and tax policy, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities. Prevailing market rates have increased for various reasons, including inflationary pressures, which has reduced the fair value of our investment portfolio. The value of our investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies, and credit spreads widening. In addition, the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio may be adversely affected by budget deficits, and declining tax bases and revenues experienced by state and local municipalities. Our investment portfolio also includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and asset-backed securities, which could be adversely affected by declines in real estate valuations, increases in unemployment, geopolitical risks and/or financial market disruption, including a heightened collection risk on the underlying loans. As a result of these matters, we may not achieve our investment objectives and a reduction in the market value of our investments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 For the significant portion of our investment portfolio that is held by MGIC, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in investment grade fixed income securities whose yields reflect their lower credit risk profile. Our investment income depends upon the size of the portfolio and its reinvestment at prevailing interest rates. A prolonged period of low investment yields would have an adverse impact on our investment income as would a decrease in the size of the portfolio. 

We structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of fixed income investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our holding company debt obligations are material. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 647 million in cash and investments at our holding company and our holding company s long-term debt obligations were 671 million in aggregate principal amount. Annual debt service on the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2022, is approximately 36 million. 
 
 The long-term debt obligations are owed by our holding company, MGIC Investment Corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends from MGIC is the principal source of our holding company cash inflow. Other sources of holding company cash inflow include settlements under intercompany tax and expense sharing agreements, investment income and raising capital in the public markets. Although MGIC holds assets in excess of its minimum statutory capital requirements and its PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of MGIC to pay dividends is restricted by insurance regulation. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. In 2023, MGIC can pay 92 million of ordinary dividends without OCI approval, before taking into consideration dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. A dividend is extraordinary when the proposed dividend amount plus dividends paid in the last twelve months from the dividend payment date exceed the ordinary dividend level. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, MGIC paid 800 million in dividends to the holding company. Future dividend payments from MGIC to the holding company will be determined in consultation with the board of directors, and after considering any updated estimates about our business. 
 Repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market (including through 10b5-1 plans) or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2022, we repurchased approximately 27.8 million shares, using approximately 386 million of holding company resources. As of December 31, 2022, we had 114 million of authorization remaining to repurchase our common stock through the end of 2023 under a share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in October 2021. If any capital contributions to our subsidiaries are required, such contributions would decrease our holding company cash and investments. 
 Your ownership in our company may be diluted by additional capital that we raise. 
 As noted above under our risk factor titled We may not continue to meet the GSEs private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease if we are required to maintain more capital in order to maintain our eligibility, although we are currently in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs, there can be no assurance that we would not seek to issue additional debt capital or to raise additional equity or equity-linked capital to manage our capital position under the PMIERs or for other purposes. Any future issuance of equity securities may dilute your ownership interest in our company. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 36 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

sales of a large number of shares or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. 
 The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for holders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive. 
 The market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly. In addition to the risk factors described herein, the following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price for our common stock: changes in general conditions in the economy, the mortgage insurance industry or the financial markets; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions or strategic initiatives; our actual or anticipated quarterly and annual operating results; changes in expectations of future financial performance (including incurred losses on our insurance in force); changes in estimates of securities analysts or rating agencies; actual or anticipated changes in our share repurchase program or dividends; changes in operating performance or market valuation of companies in the mortgage insurance industry; the addition or departure of key personnel; changes in tax law; and adverse press or news announcements affecting us or the industry. In addition, ownership by certain types of investors may affect the market price and trading volume of our common stock. For example, ownership in our common stock by investors such as index funds and exchange-traded funds can affect the stock s price when those investors must purchase or sell our common stock because the investors have experienced significant cash inflows or outflows, the index to which our common stock belongs has been rebalanced, or our common stock is added to and/or removed from an index (due to changes in our market capitalization, for example). 
 The Company may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate. 
 The United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it would no longer publish one-week and two-month tenor USD LIBOR and that after June 30, 2023, it would no longer publish all other USD LIBOR tenors. Efforts are underway to identify and transition to a set of alternative reference rates. The set of alternative rates includes the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing in 2018. Because SOFR is calculated based on different criteria than LIBOR, SOFR and LIBOR may diverge. 
 While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have three primary types of transactions that involve financial instruments referencing LIBOR. First, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 6 of the fair value of our investment portfolio consisted of securities referencing LIBOR. Second, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 0.4 billion of our risk in force was on adjustable rate mortgages whose interest is referenced to one-month USD LIBOR. A change in reference rate associated with these loans may affect their principal balance, which may affect our risk-in-force and the amount of Minimum Required Assets we are required to maintain under PMIERs. A change in reference rate may also affect the amount of principal and/or accrued interest we are required to pay in the event of a claim payment. Third, the premiums under most of our 2018-2021 XOL reinsurance agreements executed through insurance linked noted transactions are determined, in part, by the difference 

between interest payable on the reinsurers notes which reference one-month USD LIBOR and earnings from a pool of securities receiving interest that may reference LIBOR (in 2022, our total premiums on such transactions were approximately 36.4 million).

OVERVIEW 

This Overview of the MD A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Annual Report. Hence, this Overview is qualified by the information that appears elsewhere in this Annual Report, including the other portions of the MD A. 
 
 Through MGIC, the principal subsidiary of MGIC Investment Corporation, we serve lenders throughout the United States helping families achieve homeownership sooner by making affordable low-down-payment mortgages a reality through the use of private mortgage insurance. At December 31, 2022 MGIC had 295.3 billion of primary IIF. 
 Summary of financial results of MGIC Investment Corporation Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Change Selected statement of operations data Net premiums earned 1,007.1 1,014.4 (1) Investment income, net of expenses 167.5 156.4 7 Losses incurred, net (254.6) 64.6 N/M Other underwriting and operating expenses, net 236.7 198.4 19 Loss on debt extinguishment 40.2 36.9 9 Income before tax 1,090.0 801.8 36 Provision for income taxes 224.7 166.8 35 Net income 865.3 635.0 36 Diluted income per share 2.79 1.85 51 Non-GAAP Financial Measures (1)

 (1) See "Explanation and Reconciliation of our use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 
 SUMMARY OF 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 Net income of 865.3 million for 2022 increased by 230.4 million when compared to the prior year, and diluted income per share of 2.79 increased by 51 when compared to the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects a decrease in losses incurred, partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and other underwriting and operating expenses, net. Diluted income per share increased due to an increase in net income and a decrease in the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
 
 Adjusted net operating income for 2022 was 904.8 million (2021: 658.6 million) and adjusted net operating income per diluted share was 2.91 (2021: 1.91). Adjusted net operating income for 2022 and 2021 included adjustments for a loss on debt extinguishment and net realized investment gains (losses). 
 
 Losses incurred, net were (254.6) million, a decrease of 319.1 million compared with losses incurred of 64.6 million for the prior year. While new delinquency notices added approximately 149.6 million to losses incurred in 2022, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 404.1 million, primarily related to a decrease in the estimated claim rate on delinquencies. The favorable development primarily resulted from greater than expected cure rates, as borrower reinstatements and servicer mitigation efforts resulted in more cures than originally estimated. Additionally, home price 

appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property. In 2021, new delinquency notices added approximately 124.6 million to losses incurred, while our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in 60 million of favorable loss development primarily due to the decrease in the claim rate on delinquencies received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was offset by the recognition of a probable loss of 6.3 million related to litigation of our claims paying practices and adverse development on LAE reserves and reinsurance. 
 
 The increase in our provision for income taxes to 224.7 million in 2022 compared to 166.8 million in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in income before tax. Our effective tax rate for 2022 was 20.6 compared to 20.8 for 2021. 
 
 Other underwriting and operating expenses, net increased to 236.7 million in 2022 from 198.4 million in 2021 primarily due to higher expenses related to our technology investments, particularly in data and analytics, and an increase in pension expense. Pension expenses increased in 2022 as a result of settlement accounting charges during 2022.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
 Economic conditions 
 Due to higher interest rates and higher home prices in 2022, there was a decrease in home purchases in 2022 after a strong 2021. Higher interest rates also decreased refinance activity during 2022, after a robust 2021. This resulted in a decrease in our NIW, to 76.4 billion in 2022 when compared to 120.2 billion in 2021. 
 
 The level of interest rates, and home prices may change in the future. For the possible effects of such changes, see our risk factors titled " If the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines, the amount of insurance that we write could decline , Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns, and Changes in interest rates, house prices or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements may change the length of time that our policies remain in force ." 
 
 Mortgage insurance market 
 The past several years of favorable housing fundamentals and in our view, generally favorable risk characteristics of our recently insured loans contributed to a growing insurance in force. Higher interest rates and home prices, resulted in a decrease in our NIW in 2022 when compared to 2021. 
 
 The percentage of our NIW with DTI ratios over 45 and LTV's over 95 increased in 2022 when compared with 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher home prices and interest rates, and a higher percentage of NIW from purchase transactions. 
 
 Refer to "Mortgage Insurance Portfolio" for additional discussion of changes in our NIW mix during 2022. 
 
 Competition 
 PMI. The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. We believe that we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on premium rates, underwriting requirements, financial strength (including based on credit or financial strength ratings), customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, strength of management teams and field organizations, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders, and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. 
 
 Pricing practices 
 In recent years, the industry has materially reduced its use of standard rate cards, which were fairly consistent among competitors, and correspondingly increased its use of (i) "risk-based pricing systems" that use a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing based on multiple attributes that may be quickly adjusted within certain parameters, and (ii) customized rate plans, both of which typically have rates lower than the standard rate card. Our increased use of reinsurance over the past several years, and the improved credit profile and reduced loss expectations associated with loans insured after 2008, have helped to mitigate the negative effect of declining premium rates on our expected returns. 
 
 For information about competition in the private mortgage insurance industry, see our risk factor titled Competition or 

changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses" in Item 1A . 
 
 GSE Risk Share Transactions 
 In 2018, the GSEs initiated secondary mortgage market programs with loan level mortgage default coverage provided by various (re)insurers that are not mortgage insurers governed by PMIERs, and that are not selected by the lenders. Due to differences in policy terms, these programs may offer premium rates that are below prevalent single premium LPMI rates. While we view these programs as competing with traditional private mortgage insurance, we participate in these programs from time to time. 
 The GSEs (and other investors) have also used other forms of credit enhancement that did not involve traditional private mortgage insurance, such as engaging in credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors, including competitors and an affiliate of MGIC; using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage; or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement. 
 
 Government programs. PMI also competes against government mortgage insurance programs such as the FHA, VA, and USDA, primarily for lower FICO score business. The combined market share of primary mortgage insurance written by government programs continues to exceed that written by PMI in 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Refer to "Mortgage Insurance Portfolio" for additional discussion on market share, the 2022 business environment and the impact it had on operating measures including NIW, IIF and RIF. 
 
 PMIERs 
 We operate under the requirements of the PMIERs of the GSEs in order to insure loans delivered to or purchased by them. The PMIERs include financial requirements as well as business, quality control and certain transactional approval requirements. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s "Available Assets" (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its "Minimum Required Assets" (which are based on an insurer's book of risk in force, calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions, reduced for credit given for risk ceded under reinsurance transactions, and subject to a floor amount). Based on our application of PMIERs, MGIC's Available Assets under PMIERs totaled 5.7 billion, an excess of 2.3 billion over its Minimum Required Assets at December 31, 2022.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2023 
 Our outlook for 2023 should be viewed against the backdrop of the business environment discussed above. 
 
 NIW 
 Our NIW is affected by total mortgage originations, the percentage of total mortgage originations using private mortgage insurance (the "PMI penetration rate"), and our market share within the PMI industry. As of January 2023, the total average mortgage origination forecasts from the Fannie Mae and MBA indicate mortgage originations of 1.8 trillion in 2023, compared to an estimated 2.3 trillion in 2022. Both purchase originations and refinance transactions are forecasted to decline in 2023 when compared to 2022. As a result of the decrease in forecasted mortgage originations, we are expecting NIW to be lower in 2023 compared to 2022. 
 
 The widespread use of risk based pricing systems by the PMI industry makes it more difficult to compare our rates to those offered by our competitors. We may not be aware of industry rate changes until we observe that our volume of NIW has changed. In addition, business under customized rate plans is awarded by certain customers for only limited periods of time. As a result, our NIW may fluctuate more than it had in the past. 
 
 IIF 
 Our IIF increased 7.6 in 2022 and is expected to be relatively flat in 2023. Our book of IIF is an important driver of our future revenues, and its growth is driven by our ability to generate NIW and the retention of our IIF , as measured by our persistency. Interest rates influence both our NIW and persistency. Generally speaking, in a rising rate environment, total mortgage originations may decline; however, absent material accumulated home price appreciation since the issuance of a policy, we would also expect policy cancellation rates to decline, and in turn increase persistency, although the impact generally lags the change in interest rates. In 2023, we expect interest rates to remain elevated compared to recent years and home prices to decline. 
 
 Results of operations 
 Premiums. Our direct premiums written and earned are impacted by our IIF during the period and our in force premium yield, both of which are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 when compared to 2022. Premiums earned are also impacted by the amount of accelerated premiums from single premium policy cancellations, which generally decrease as refinance activity decreases. Our unearned premium decreased to 195.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 241.7 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Our net premiums written and earned are primarily impacted by the changes in the direct premiums written and earned noted above and by the amount of premiums we cede under our quota share and excess of loss reinsurance transactions. The amount of premiums we cede in 2023 will be affected by any changes in our reinsurance coverage. Premiums we cede under our quota share transactions is also impacted by the profit commission we receive. The amount of profit commission is variable year-to-year and is dependent on the amount of losses incurred ceded. In 2022, negative losses incurred increased the profit commission we received, resulting in lower ceded premiums. Increases in ceded losses incurred will benefit our losses incurred line, but will result in lower profit commission and higher ceded premiums. 

Factors that affect the amount of premiums we earn from our IIF are further discussed in our "Consolidated Results of Operations - Premium yield." 
 
 Investment income. Net investment income is a material contributor to our results of operations. We expect net investment income in 2023 to increase in comparison to 2022, primarily due to higher average investment yields. The amount of investment income will be impacted by the change in the yield we can earn on investments and the level of invested assets. The level of invested assets will primarily be impacted by the amount of cash we expect to use in financing activities relative to our cash from operations. The magnitude of any change in our invested asset level will be subject to the timing of our financing activities. 
 
 Losses. Losses incurred, net is impacted by the level of new delinquency notices. Generally, on our primary business, the highest claim frequency years have been the third and fourth year after loan origination. As of December 31, 2022, 80 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2019, 85 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2018, and 88 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2017. The pattern of claim frequency can be affected by many factors, including persistency and deteriorating economic conditions. 
 
 Our claims paid activity slowed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily due to forbearance and foreclosure moratoriums put in place. Claim activity has not yet returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. We expect net losses and LAE paid to increase, however, the magnitude and timing of the increases are uncertain. 
 
 Underwriting and operating expenses, net. We expect underwriting and operating expenses, net to be modestly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. In recent years, we have made additional investments in our technology, particularly in data and analytics and will continue to make similar investments in 2023. Pension expenses also increased in 2022 as a result of settlement accounting charges incurred during 2022. In 2023, we expect to incur settlement accounting charges as a result of lump sum settlements for employees who retired in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 Income taxes. We expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be approximately 21 . 
 
 CAPITAL 
 MGIC dividend payments to our holding company 
 The ability of MGIC to pay dividends is restricted by insurance regulation. Amounts in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and may not be paid if disapproved by the OCI. A dividend is extraordinary when the proposed dividend amount, plus dividends paid in the twelve months preceding the dividend payment date exceed the ordinary dividend level. In 2023, MGIC could pay 92 million of ordinary dividends without OCI approval, before taking into consideration dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In 2022 and 2021, MGIC paid a cash and/or investment security dividend of 800 million and 400 million, respectively, to our holding company. Future dividend payments from MGIC to the holding company will continue to be determined in consultation with the board.

Share repurchase programs 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market (including through 10b5-1 plans) or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase programs may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. We repurchased approximately 27.8 million shares in 2022 using approximately 386 million of holding company resources. In 2021, we repurchased approximately 19.0 million shares of our common stock using approximately 291 million of holding company resources. As of December 31, 2022, we had 114 million of authorization remaining to repurchase our common stock through the end of 2023 under a share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in October 2021. 
 
 The following table shows details of our share repurchase programs. 
 Repurchase Program Expiration Date Repurchased (in millions) Authorization Remaining (in millions) 2020 Authorization December 31, 2021 300 2021 Authorization December 31, 2023 386 114 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 293 million shares of common stock outstanding which was a decrease of 8.4 from December 31, 2021. 
 
 Dividends to shareholders 
 In the first and second quarters of 2022, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.08 per share to shareholders which totaled 51.0 million. In the third and fourth quarters of 2022, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.10 per share which totaled 60.7 million. On January 24, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to holders of the company's common stock of 0.10 per share payable on March 2, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2023. 
 
 For information about how the payment of dividends by our holding company will result in an adjustment to the conversion rate and price of our convertible securities, see our risk factor titled Your ownership in our company may be diluted by additional capital that we raise in Item 1A . 
 
 GSEs 
 We must comply with a GSE's PMIERs to be eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by that GSE. The PMIERs include financial requirements, as well as business, quality control and certain transaction approval requirements. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s Available Assets (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its Minimum Required Assets (which are generally based on an insurer s book of risk in force and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions, reduced for credit given for risk ceded under reinsurance transactions). 
 
 The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. 

If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our NIW, the substantial majority of which is for loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. In addition to the increase in Minimum Required Assets associated with delinquent loans, factors that may negatively impact MGIC s ability to continue to comply with the financial requirements of the PMIERs include the following: 

The GSEs may make the PMIERs more onerous in the future. The PMIERs provide that the factors that determine Minimum Required Assets will be updated periodically, or as needed if there is a significant change in macroeconomic conditions or loan performance. We do not anticipate that the regular periodic updates will occur more frequently than once every two years. The PMIERs state that the GSEs will provide notice 180 days prior to the effective date of updates to the factors; however, the GSEs may amend any portion of the PMIERs at any time. 

The PMIERS may be changed in response to the final regulatory capital framework for the GSEs which was established in February 2022. 
 Our future operating results may be negatively impacted by the matters discussed in our Risk Factors. Such matters could decrease our revenues, increase our losses or require the use of assets, thereby creating a shortfall in Available Assets. 
 Should capital be needed by MGIC in the future, capital contributions from our holding company may not be available due to competing demands on holding company resources, including for repayment of debt. 
 Our reinsurance transactions enable us to earn higher returns on our business than we would without them because they reduce the Minimum Required Assets we must hold under PMIERs. However, reinsurance may not always be available to us, or available on similar terms and our reinsurance subjects us to counterparty credit risk. Our access to reinsurance may be disrupted and the terms under which we are able to obtain reinsurance may be less attractive than in the past due to volatility stemming from circumstances such as higher interest rates, increased inflation, global events such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and other factors. In 2022, execution of transactions for XOL reinsurance through the ILN market was more challenging primarily due to increased pricing. 
 
 The calculated credit for XOL Transactions under PMIERs is generally based on the PMIERs requirement of the covered loans and the attachment and detachment point of the coverage. PMIERs credit is generally not given for the reinsured risk above the PMIERs requirement. Our existing reinsurance transactions are subject to periodic review by the GSEs and there is a risk we will not receive our current level of credit in future periods for the risk ceded under them. In addition, we may not receive the same level of credit under future transactions that we receive under existing transactions. If MGIC is not allowed certain levels of credit under the PMIERs, under certain circumstances, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions without penalties. 
 
 State Regulations 
 The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 46 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a MPP. MGIC's "policyholder position" includes its net worth or surplus and its, contingency reserve. 
 At December 31, 2022, MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was 10.2 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was 3.5 billion above the required MPP of 2.1 billion. Our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP reflect full credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded under such transactions. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the State Capital Requirements or the PMIERs, MGIC may terminate the reinsurance transactions, without penalty. At this time, we expect MGIC to continue to comply with the current State Capital Requirements; however, refer to our risk factor titled State capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis in Item 1A for more information about matters that could negatively affect such compliance. 
 The NAIC previously announced plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. In 2019, a working group of state regulators released an exposure draft of a revised Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act and a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers, although certain items were not completely addressed by the framework, including the treatment of ceded risk and minimum capital floors. In October 2022, the NAIC working group released a revised exposure draft of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act that does not include changes to the capital requirements of the existing Model Act. 
 GSE REFORM 
 The FHFA has been the conservator of the GSEs since 2008 and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential housing finance system through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change, including through administrative action, in ways that have a material adverse effect on us and that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. 
 
 It is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the residential housing finance system in the future. The timing and impact on our business of any resulting changes is uncertain. Many of the proposed changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. 
 
 For additional information about the business practices of the GSEs, see our Risk Factor titled Changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's ("the GSEs"), federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses . in Item 1A . 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted our 2020 financial results, as we reserved for losses associated with the increased delinquency notices received. Through December 31, 2022, the vast majority of those delinquency notices have cured, resulting in a decrease in losses incurred as we recognized favorable loss development. 
 Forbearance for borrowers who were affected by COVID-19 allows mortgage payments to be suspended for a period of time. Historically, forbearance plans have reduced the incidence of our losses on affected loans. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic impact of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the ultimate effect of COVID-19 related forbearances on our loss incidence. Whether a loan delinquency will cure, including through modification, when forbearance ends will depend on the economic circumstances of the borrower at that time. The severity of losses associated with delinquencies that do not cure will depend on economic conditions at that time, including home prices. 
 
 Foreclosures on mortgages purchased or securitized by the GSEs were suspended through July 31, 2021. Under a CFPB rule that was effective through December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions, servicers were required to ensure that at least one temporary procedural safeguard had been met before referring 120-day delinquent loans for foreclosure. Claim activity has not yet returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. 
 
 For additional information about how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future financial results, business, liquidity, and/or financial condition, see our Risk Factor titled The COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our business and future financial condition. 
 
 FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS 
 Our current and future business, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by macroeconomic conditions such as rising interest rates, home prices, housing demand, level of employment, inflation, restrictions and costs on mortgage credit, and other factors. For additional information on how on our business may be impacted see our Risk Factor titled Downturns in the domestic economy or declines in home prices may result in more homeowners defaulting and our losses increasing, with a corresponding decrease in our returns. 
 
 As noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 The future effects of changing climatic conditions on our business is uncertain. For information about possible effects, please refer to our Risk Factor titled Pandemics, hurricanes and other natural disasters may impact our incurred losses, the amount and timing of paid claims, our inventory of notices of default and our Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs. 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 47 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Our results of operations are affected by: 
 
 Premiums written and earned 
 Premiums written and earned in a year are influenced by: 
 NIW, which increases IIF. Many factors affect NIW, including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages from the FHA, the VA, other mortgage insurers, and other alternatives to mortgage insurance, including GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance. NIW does not include loans previously insured by us that are modified, such as loans modified under HARP. 
 
 Cancellations, which reduce IIF. Cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book, current home values compared to values when the loans in the in force book were insured and the terms on which mortgage credit is available. Home price appreciation can give homeowners the right to cancel mortgage insurance on their loans if sufficient home equity is achieved. Cancellations also result from policy rescissions, which require us to return any premiums received on the rescinded policies, and claim payments, which require us to return any premium received on the related policies from the date of default on the insured loans. Cancellations of single premium policies, which are generally non-refundable, result in immediate recognition of any remaining unearned premium. 
 
 Premium rates, which are affected by product type, competitive pressures, the risk characteristics of the insured loans, the percentage of coverage on the insured loans, and PMIERs capital requirements. The substantial majority of our monthly and annual mortgage insurance premiums are under premium plans for which, for the first ten years of the policy, the amount of premium is determined by multiplying the initial premium rate by the original loan balance; thereafter, the premium rate resets to a lower rate used for the remaining life of the policy. The remainder of our monthly and annual premiums are under premium plans for which premiums are determined by a fixed percentage of the loan s amortizing balance over the life of the policy. 
 
 Premiums ceded, net of profit commission under our QSR Transactions, and premiums ceded under our XOL Transactions, are primarily affected by the percentage of our IIF subject to our reinsurance transactions. The profit commission under our QSR Transactions also varies inversely with the level of ceded losses incurred on a dollar for dollar basis and can be eliminated at ceded loss levels higher than what we have experienced on our QSR Transactions. As a result, lower levels of losses incurred result in a higher profit commission and less benefit from ceded losses incurred; higher levels of losses incurred result in more benefit from ceded losses incurred and a lower profit commission (or for certain levels of accident year loss ratios, its elimination). See Note 9 Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 Premiums earned are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period. A change in the 

average IIF in the current period compared to an earlier period is a factor that will increase (when the average in force is higher) or reduce (when it is lower) premiums written and earned in the current period, although this effect may be enhanced (or mitigated) by the factors discussed above. 
 
 Investment income 
 Our investment portfolio is composed principally of investment grade fixed income securities. The principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield. As measured by amortized cost (which excludes changes in fair value, such as from changes in interest rates), the size of the investment portfolio is mainly a function of cash generated from (or used in) operations, such as net premiums written, investment income, net claim payments and expenses, and cash provided by (or used for) non-operating activities, such as debt or stock issuances or repurchases, and dividends. 
 
 Losses incurred 
 Losses incurred are the current expense that reflects claim payments, costs of settling claims, and changes in our estimates of payments that will ultimately be made as a result of delinquencies on insured loans. As explained under Critical Accounting Estimates below, except in the case of a premium deficiency reserve, we recognize an estimate of this expense only for delinquent loans. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of new delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern, with new delinquencies in the first part of the year lower than new delinquencies in the latter part of the year. The state of the economy, local housing markets, and various other factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. Losses incurred are generally affected by: 
 
 The state of the economy, including unemployment and housing values, each of which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency. 
 
 The product mix of the in force book, with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims. 
 
 The size of loans insured, with higher average loan amounts tending to increase incurred losses. 
 
 The percentage of coverage on insured loans, with deeper average coverage tending to increase incurred losses. 
 
 The rate at which we rescind policies or curtail claims. Our estimated loss reserves incorporate our estimates of future rescissions of policies and curtailments of claims, and reversals of rescissions and curtailments. We collectively refer to such rescissions and denials as rescissions and variations of this term. We call reductions to claims "curtailments." 
 
 The distribution of claims over the life of a book. Historically, the first few years after loans are originated are a period of relatively low claims, with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining, although persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment and housing prices, and other factors can affect this pattern. For example, a weak economy or housing 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 48 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

value declines can lead to claims from older books increasing, continuing at stable levels or experiencing a lower rate of decline. See further information under Mortgage insurance earnings and cash flow cycle below. 
 
 Losses ceded under reinsurance transactions. See Note 9 Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses 
 Underwriting and other expenses includes items such as employee compensation, fees for professional and consulting services, depreciation and maintenance expense, and premium taxes, and are reported net of ceding commissions associated with our QSR Transactions. Employee compensation expenses are variable due to share-based compensation, changes in benefits, and changes in headcount (which can fluctuate due to volume of NIW). See Note 9 Reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of ceding commission on our QSR Transactions. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense reflects the interest associated with our consolidated outstanding debt obligations discussed in Note 7 Debt to our consolidated financial statements and under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 Other 
 Certain activities that we do not consider being part of our fundamental operating activities may also impact our results of operations and are described below. 
 
 Gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments 
 Fixed income securities. Investment gains and losses reflect the difference between the amount received on the sale of a fixed income security and the fixed income security s cost basis, as well as any credit allowances and any impairments on securities we intend to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. The amount received on the sale of fixed income securities is affected by the coupon rate of the security compared to the yield of comparable securities at the time of sale. 
 
 Equity securities. Investment gains and losses are accounted for as a function of the periodic change in fair value. 
 
 Financial instruments. Investment gains and losses on the embedded derivative on our Home Re Transactions reflect the present value impact of the variation in investment income on assets on the insurance-linked notes held by the reinsurance trusts and the contractual reference rate used to calculate the reinsurance premiums we estimate we will pay over the estimated remaining life. 
 
 Loss on debt extinguishment 
 Gains and losses on debt extinguishment result from discretionary activities that are undertaken to enhance our capital position, improve our debt profile and/or reduce potential dilution from our outstanding convertible debt. Extinguishing our outstanding debt obligations early through these discretionary activities may result in losses primarily driven by the payment of consideration in excess of our carrying value , and the write off of 

unamortized debt issuance costs on the extinguished portion of the debt. 
 
 Refer to Explanation and reconciliation of our use of Non-GAAP financial measures below to understand how these items impact our evaluation of our core financial performance. 
 
 MORTGAGE INSURANCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW CYCLE 
 In general, the majority of any underwriting profit that a book generates occurs in the early years of the book, with the largest portion of any underwriting profit realized in the first year following the year the book was written. Subsequent years of a book may result in either underwriting profit or underwriting losses. This pattern of results typically occurs because relatively few of the incurred losses on delinquencies that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years of the book, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments) and increasing losses. The typical pattern is also a function of premium rates generally resetting to lower levels after ten years. The state of the economy, local housing markets and various other factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. 
 
 CYBERSECURITY 
 As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential and proprietary information, including personal information of consumers and employees, on our servers and those of cloud computing services. Federal and state laws designed to promote the protection of such information require businesses that collect or maintain personal information to adopt information security programs, and to notify individuals, and in some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities, of security breaches involving personally identifiable information. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including by cyber attacks, such as those involving ransomware. The Company discovers vulnerabilities and regularly blocks a high volume of attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that will hinder the Company s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. Such attacks may also increase as a result of retaliation by Russia in response to actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in connection with Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. The Company operates under a hybrid workforce model and such model may be more vulnerable to security breaches. 
 
 While we have information security policies and systems in place to secure our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive information, there can be no assurance with respect to our systems and those of our third-party vendors that unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the sensitive information, either through the actions of third parties or employees, will not occur. Due to our reliance on information technology systems, including ours and those of our customers and third-party service providers, and to the sensitivity of the information that we maintain, unauthorized access to the systems or disclosure of the information could adversely affect our reputation, severely disrupt our operations, result in a loss of business and expose us to material claims for damages and may require that we provide

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We believe that use of the Non-GAAP measures of adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss), adjusted net operating income (loss) and adjusted net operating income (loss) per diluted share facilitate the evaluation of the company's core financial performance thereby providing relevant information to investors. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. 
 
 Adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP income (loss) before tax, excluding the effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain and losses on debt extinguishment, and infrequent or unusual non-operating items where applicable. 
 
 Adjusted net operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the after-tax effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain and losses on debt extinguishment, and infrequent or unusual non-operating items where applicable. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax operating income (loss) are tax effected using a federal statutory tax rate of 21 . 
 
 Adjusted net operating income (loss) per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share by dividing (i) adjusted net operating income (loss) after making adjustments for interest expense on convertible debt, whenever the impact is dilutive by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from unvested restricted stock units and from convertible debt when dilutive under the if-converted method. 

Although adjusted pre-tax operating income (loss) and adjusted net operating income (loss) exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) impacted by both discretionary and other economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these adjustments. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us. 
 
 (1) Net realized investment gains (losses). The recognition of net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the timing of individual securities sales is highly discretionary and is influenced by such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles. 
 (2) Gains and losses on debt extinguishment. Gains and losses on debt extinguishment result from discretionary activities that are undertaken to enhance our capital position, improve our debt profile, and/or reduce potential dilution from our outstanding convertible debt. 
 (3) Infrequent or unusual non-operating items . Items that are non-recurring in nature and are not part of our primary operating activities.

MORTGAGE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO 
 MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS 
 The total amount of mortgage originations is generally influenced by the level of new and existing home sales, interest rates, the percentage of homes purchased for cash, and the level of refinance activity. PMI market share of total mortgage originations is influenced by the mix of purchase and refinance originations. PMI market share is also impacted by the market share of total originations of the FHA, VA, USDA, and other alternatives to mortgage insurance, including GSE programs that may reduce or eliminate the demand for mortgage insurance. 
 
 Total mortgage originations in 2022 as compared to 2021 reflects higher interest rates and home prices, contributing to a decrease in home purchase activity in 2022 after a strong 2021. Total mortgage originations are forecasted to be lower in 2023, in comparison to the last two years. Both purchase and refinance markets are forecasted to decrease in 2023 when compared to estimates for 2022.

 The following tables provide information about loan characteristics associated with our NIW. 
 The percentage of our NIW with DTI ratios over 45 and LTV's over 95 increased in 2022 compared with 2021. The increases were primarily driven by higher home prices and interest rates, and a higher percentage of NIW from purchase transactions.

 IIF AND RIF 
 Our IIF grew 7.6 in 2022, and 11.3 in 2021, as NIW more than offset policy cancellations. Cancellation activity is impacted by refinancing activity, policies cancelled when borrowers achieve the required amount of home equity, and cancellations due to claim payment. Refinancing activity has historically been affected by the level of mortgage interest rates and the level of home price appreciation. Cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates, although they generally lag a change in direction. 
 
 Persistency. Our persistency at December 31, 2022 was 79.8 compared to 62.6 at December 31, 2021. Since 2000, our year-end persistency ranged from a high of 84.7 at December 31, 2009 to a low of 47.1 at December 31, 2003. Our persistency rate is primarily affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates on our IIF, which affects the vulnerability of the IIF to refinancing; and the current amount of equity that borrowers have in the homes underlying our IIF.

CREDIT PROFILE OF OUR PRIMARY RIF 
 Our 2009 and later books possess significantly improved risk characteristics when compared to our 2005-2008 books. Modification and refinance programs, such as HAMP and HARP, which expired at the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively, but have been replaced by other GSE modification programs, make outstanding loans more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. As of December 31, 2022, modifications accounted for approximately 4.2 of our total primary RIF, compared to 5.4 at December 31, 2021. Loans associated with 87 of all our modifications were current as of December 31, 2022. For additional information on the composition of our primary RIF see "Business - Our Products and Services"

 POOL AND OTHER INSURANCE 
 MGIC has written no new pool insurance since 2008, however, for a variety of reasons, including responding to capital market alternatives to private mortgage insurance and customer demands, MGIC may write pool risk in the future. Our direct pool RIF was 276 million 196 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and 80 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2022 compared to 305 million 206 million on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and 99 million on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2021. If claim payments associated with a specific pool reach the aggregate loss limit, the remaining IIF within the pool would be cancelled and any remaining defaults under the pool would be removed from our default inventory. 
 
 In connection with the GSEs' CRT programs, an insurance subsidiary of MGIC provides insurance and reinsurance covering portions of the credit risk related to certain reference pools of mortgages acquired by the GSEs. Our RIF, as reported to us, related to these programs was approximately 226 million and 321 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following section of the MD A provides a comparative discussion of our Consolidated Results of Operations for the two-year period ended December 31, 2022. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates used by us that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see "Critical Accounting Estimates" below. 
 
 Revenues 
 Revenues Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Change Net premiums written 960.7 969.0 (1) Net premiums earned 1,007.1 1,014.4 (1) Investment income, net of expenses 167.5 156.4 7 Net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments (7.5) 5.9 N/M Other revenue 5.6 9.0 (38) Total revenues 1,172.8 1,185.7 (1) 

NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED 
 Net premiums written and earned decreased 1 , respectively, in 2022 compared with the prior year. The decrease in premiums written and earned in 2022 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in the direct premium yield, offset by a decrease in ceded premiums written and earned. 
 
 Premium yields 
 Premium yield is net premiums earned divided by average IIF during the year and is influenced by a number of key drivers, which have a varying impact from period to period. The following table provides information related to our premium yield for 2022, and 2021. 
 Premium Yield Year Ended December 31, (in basis points) 2022 2021 In force portfolio yield (1) 39.4 42.2 Premium refunds 0.1 (0.6) Accelerated earnings on single premium policies 1.0 3.2 Total direct premium yield 40.5 44.8 Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission and assumed premiums (2) (5.2) (5.9) Net premium yield 35.3 38.9 
 (1) Total direct premiums earned, excluding premium refunds and accelerated premiums from single premium policy cancellations divided by average primary insurance in force. 
 (2) Assumed premiums include those from our participation in GSE CRT programs, of which the impact on the net premium yield was 0.3 bps in 2022 and 0.4 bps in 2021 

Changes in the net premium yields when compared to the respective prior year periods reflect the following: 
 In force Portfolio Yield A larger percentage of our IIF is from book years with lower premium rates due to a decline in premium rates in recent years resulting from pricing competition, insuring mortgages with lower risk characteristics, lower required capital, the availability of reinsurance and certain policies undergoing premium rate resets on their ten-year anniversaries. Premium Refunds Premium refunds are primarily driven by claim activity and our estimate of refundable premiums on our delinquency inventory. The low level of claims received have resulted in a lower level of premium refunds. Our estimate of refundable premium on our delinquency inventory fluctuates with changes in our delinquency inventory and our estimate of the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim. Accelerated earnings on single premium policies The lower level of refinance transactions has reduced the benefit from accelerated earned premium from cancellation of single premium policies prior to their estimated policy life. Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission and assumed premiums Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission adversely impacts our net premium yield. Ceded premiums earned, net of profit commission, are associated with the QSR Transactions and the XOL Transactions. Assumed premiums consists primarily of premiums from GSE CRT programs. See Reinsurance Transactions below for further discussion on our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 As discussed in our Risk Factor titled "Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses," the private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and premium rates have declined over the past several years. With the smaller origination market, higher persistency rate, and continued high credit quality for NIW expected in 2023, we expect our in force portfolio premium yield to remain relatively flat during 2023.

See " Overview Factors Affecting Our Results " above for additional factors that also influence the amount of net premiums written and earned in a year. 
 
 REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS 
 Quota share reinsurance 
 Our quota share reinsurance affects various lines of our statements of operations and therefore we believe it should be analyzed by reviewing its total effect on our pre-tax income, as described below. 
 We cede a fixed percentage of premiums earned and received on insurance covered by the agreements. We receive the benefit of a profit commission through a reduction in the premiums we cede. The profit commission varies inversely with the level of losses incurred on a "dollar for dollar" basis and can be eliminated at loss levels higher than we are currently experiencing. As a result, lower levels of losses incurred result in a higher profit commission and less benefit from ceded losses incurred, higher levels of ceded losses incurred result in more benefit from ceded losses incurred and a lower profit commission (or for certain levels of losses of accident year loss ratios, its elimination). We receive the benefit of a ceding commission through a reduction in underwriting expenses equal to 20 of premiums ceded (before the effect of the profit commission). We cede a fixed percentage of losses incurred on insurance covered by the agreements. 
 
 The following table provides information related to our QSR Transactions for 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Quota share reinsurance As of and For the Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Statements of operations: Ceded premiums written and earned, net of profit commission 86,435 118,537 of direct premiums written 8 11 of direct premiums earned 7 10 Profit commission 176,084 153,759 Ceding commissions 52,071 53,460 Ceded losses incurred (19,837) 9,862 Mortgage insurance portfolio: Ceded RIF (in millions) 2015 QSR 889 2019 QSR 1,539 2020 QSR 3,902 4,754 2021 QSR 6,809 7,470 2022 QSR 5,027 Credit Union QSR 2,261 1,594 Total ceded RIF 17,999 16,246 

Ceded premiums written, and earned net of profit commission decreased in 2022 when compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in the profit commission, which reduces ceded premiums written and earned. The increase in profit commission was driven by negative losses incurred in 2022. 
 
 Ceded losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect favorable loss reserve development on previously received delinquency notices. See "Losses Incurred, net below for discussion of our loss reserves. 
 
 We terminated our 2015 and 2019 QSR Transactions effective December 31, 2022 and incurred an early termination fee of 2 million on our 2019 QSR Transaction. We terminated our 2017 and 2018 QSR Transactions effective December 31, 2021 and incurred an early termination fee of 5 million. The termination of the QSR Transactions reduce the amount of IIF and RIF subject to QSR transactions. 
 
 Covered Risk 
 The percentages of our NIW, new risk written, IIF, and RIF subject to our QSR Transactions as shown in the following table will vary from period to period in part due to the mix of our risk written during the period and the number of active QSR Transactions. 
 Quota share reinsurance As of and For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 NIW subject to QSR Transactions 87.4 81.9 New Risk Written subject to QSR Transactions 93.0 90.5 IIF subject to QSR Transactions 67.9 78.4 RIF subject to QSR Transactions 73.0 77.9 
 
 The NIW subject to quota share reinsurance increased in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was driven by a decrease in refinance transactions which resulted in a decrease in NIW with LTVs less than or equal to 85 , which generally have lower coverage percentages, and are excluded from the QSR Transactions. 
 
 2023 QSR Transaction. 
 We have agreed to terms on a quota share transaction with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers covering most of our NIW in 2023 (with an additional 10.0 quota share). This is in addition to the reinsurance agreements executed in 2022 that included a 15 quota share on eligible 2023 NIW.

Excess of loss reinsurance 
 We have Excess-of-loss transactions XOL Transactions with a panel of unaffiliated reinsurers executed through the traditional reinsurance market Traditional XOL Transaction and with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Transactions ). 
 
 The 2022 Traditional XOL Transaction provides 142.6 million of reinsurance coverage on eligible NIW in 2022. The Traditional XOL Transaction has contractual termination date after approximately ten years, with an optional termination date after seven years and quarterly thereafter. For the covered policies, we retain the first layer of the aggregate losses paid, and the reinsurers will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage is subject to adjustment based on the risk characteristics of the covered loans. The reinsurance premiums ceded to the Traditional XOL Transaction are based off the remaining reinsurance coverage levels. 
 
 The Home Re Transactions are executed with unaffiliated special purpose entities Home Re Entities through the issuance of insurance linked notes ILNs ). At December 31, 2022 our Home Re Transactions provided 1.6 billion of loss coverage on a portfolio of policies having an in force date from July 1, 2016 through March 31, 2019, and from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021; all dates inclusive. For this reinsurance coverage, we retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses paid, and a Home Re Entity will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance amount. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the premiums under most of our 2018-2021 reference the one-month LIBOR. As discussed in our risk factor titled "The Company may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate," the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, will cease publishing all USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023.

 LOSSES INCURRED, NET 
 As discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates below and consistent with industry practices, we establish case loss reserves for future claims on delinquent loans that were reported to us as two payments past due and have not become current or resulted in a claim payment. Such loans are referred to as being in our delinquency inventory. Case loss reserves are established based on estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. 
 
 IBNR reserves are established for delinquencies estimated to have occurred prior to the close of an accounting period, but have not yet been reported to us. IBNR reserves are established using estimated delinquencies, claim rates and claim severities. 
 
 Estimation of losses is inherently judgmental. Even in a stable environment, changes to our estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy, including unemployment, and the current and future strength of local housing markets; exposure on insured loans; the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing; and curtailments and rescissions. The actual amount of the claim payments may be substantially different than our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions, including unemployment, leading to a reduction in borrowers income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, the impact of past and future government initiatives and actions taken by the GSEs (including mortgage forbearance programs and foreclosure moratoriums), and a drop in housing values that could result in, among other things, greater losses on loans, and may affect borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the net value of the home is below the mortgage balance. Loss reserves in the future will also be dependent on the number of loans reported to us as delinquent. 
 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, losses incurred have followed a seasonal trend in which the second half of the year has weaker credit performance than the first half, with higher new notice activity and a lower cure rate. The state of the economy, local housing markets and various other factors, may result in delinquencies not following the typical pattern. 
 
 As discussed in our Risk Factors titled The Covid-19 pandemic may materially impact our business, and future financial condition, " the magnitude of any future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our incurred losses is uncertain and cannot be predicted. As discussed in our Risk Factor titled Because we 

establish loss reserves only upon a loan delinquency rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods if we have not received a notice of delinquency with respect to a loan and if we have not estimated the loan to be delinquent as of December 31, 2022 and recorded an IBNR reserve, then we have not yet recorded an incurred loss with respect to that loan. 
 
 Our estimates are also affected by any agreements we enter into regarding our claims paying practices. 
 
 Losses incurred, net decreased to (254.6) million compared to 64.6 million in 2021, primarily due to favorable loss reserve development. While new delinquency notices added approximately 149.6 million to losses incurred in 2022, our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in favorable development of approximately 404.1 million primarily related to a decrease in the estimated claim rate on delinquencies. The favorable development primarily resulted from greater than expected cure rates, as borrower reinstatements and servicer mitigation efforts resulted in more cures than originally estimated. Additionally, home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property. In 2021, new delinquency notices added approximately 124.6 million to losses incurred, and our re-estimation of loss reserves on previously received delinquency notices resulted in 60.0 million of favorable loss development, primarily due to the decrease in the claim rate on delinquencies received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was offset by the recognition of a probable loss of 6.3 million related to litigation of our claims paying practices and adverse development on LAE reserves and reinsurance.

 Historically, forbearance plans have reduced the incidence of our losses on affected loans. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic impact of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the ultimate effect of COVID-19 related forbearances on our loss incidence. Whether a loan delinquency will cure, including through modification, when forbearance ends will depend on the economic circumstances of the borrower at that time. The severity of losses associated with delinquencies that do not cure will depend on economic conditions at that time, including home prices.

Claims severity 
 Factors that impact claim severity include: 

economic conditions at that time, including home prices compared to home prices at the time of placement of coverage exposure on the loan, which is the unpaid principal balance of the loan times our insurance coverage percentage, length of time between delinquency and claim filing (which impacts the amount of interest and expenses, with a longer period between default and claim filing generally increasing severity), and curtailments. 

As discussed in Note 8 - "Loss Reserves," our loss reserves estimates take into consideration trends over time, because the development of the delinquencies may vary from period to period without establishing a meaningful trend. An increase in loss mitigation activities , primarily third party acquisitions (sometimes referred to as short sales ), has resulted in a decrease in the average claim paid and the average claim paid as a percentage of exposure in recent years. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of claims received decreased. Claim activity and the average claims paid as a percentage of exposure has not yet returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. The magnitude and timing of the increases are uncertain. 
 
 The majority of loans insured prior to 2009 (which represent 41 of the loans in the delinquency inventory) are covered by master policy terms that, except under certain circumstances, do not limit the number of years that an insured can include interest when filing a claim. Under our current master policy terms, an insured can include accumulated interest when filing a claim only for the first three years the loan is delinquent. In each case, the insured must comply with its obligations under the terms of the applicable master policy.

The length of time a loan is in the delinquency inventory can differ from the number of payments that the borrower has not made or is considered delinquent. These differences typically result from a borrower making monthly payments that do not result in the loan becoming fully current. The number of payments that a borrower is delinquent is shown in the following table. 
 
 Primary delinquent inventory - number of payments delinquent 2022 2021 3 payments or less 11,484 9,529 4 - 11 payments 8,026 9,208 12 payments or more (1) 
 6,877 14,553 Total 26,387 33,290 3 payments or less 44 28 4 - 11 payments 30 28 12 payments or more 26 44 Total 100 100 
 (1) Approximately 28 and 13 of the loans in the primary delinquency inventory with 12 payments or more delinquent have at least 36 payments delinquent as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 NET LOSSES AND LAE PAID 
 Net losses and LAE paid were flat in 2022 compared to 2021, while direct losses paid decreased slightly in 2022 compared to 2021. Our claims paid activity slowed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily due to forbearance and foreclosure moratoriums put in place. We expect net losses and LAE paid to increase, however, the magnitude and timing of the increases are uncertain. 
 
 The losses and LAE paid on reinsurance terminations decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily due to the losses and LAE recoverable from reinsurers at time of termination of the 2015 and 2019 QSR Transactions (effective December 31, 2022), compared to the losses and LAE recoverable from reinsurers at time of termination of the 2017 and 2018 QSR transaction (effective December 31, 2021). In a reinsurance termination, amounts for any incurred but unpaid losses are due to us from the reinsurer 

The table below presents our net losses and LAE paid for 2022 and 2021.

 (2) See Note 9 - "Reinsurance" for additional information on our reinsurance terminations 
 
 The primary average claim paid can vary materially from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including the local market conditions, average loan amount, average coverage percentage, the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing, and our loss mitigation efforts on loans for which claims are paid. 
 
 The primary average RIF on delinquent loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the top 5 jurisdictions (based on December 31, 2022 delinquency inventory) appears in the following table. 
 Primary average RIF - delinquent loans 2022 2021 Florida 59,515 56,227 Texas 53,364 51,037 Illinois 41,640 40,798 Pennsylvania 40,993 39,523 New York 74,760 74,836 All other jurisdictions 51,693 51,652 Total all jurisdictions 52,511 51,887 
 The primary average RIF on all loans was 64,784 and 59,518 at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in loans from recent years which generally have larger loan balances.

LOSS RESERVES 
 Our primary delinquency inventory was 26,387 at December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 21 from December 31, 2021. We also experienced a decrease in the average direct reserve per default as shown in the table below. The average direct reserve per default is influenced by the number of consecutive months a borrower has been delinquent. Generally, a defaulted loan with more missed payments is more likely to result in a claim. The number of delinquencies in inventory with twelve or more missed payments at December 31, 2022 decreased when compared to the prior year. (See Note 8 -"Loss Reserves ," table 8.4.) The average direct reserve per default is also impacted by the average RIF on delinquent loans as shown above. 
 
 The gross reserves as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 appear in the table below.

 On our primary business, the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third and fourth year after loan origination. However, the pattern of claim frequency can be affected by many factors, including persistency and deteriorating economic conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims. As of December 31, 2022, 80 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2019, 85 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2018, and 88 of our primary RIF was written subsequent to December 31, 2017. 
 
 UNDERWRITING AND OTHER EXPENSES, NET 
 Underwriting and other expenses includes items such as employee compensation costs, fees for professional and consulting services, depreciation and maintenance expense, and premium taxes, and are reported net of ceding commissions. 
 
 Underwriting and other expenses, net for 2022 increased to 236.7 million from 198.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to our technology investments, particularly in data and analytics, and an increase in pension expense. Pension expenses increased in 2022 as a result of settlement accounting charges during 2022. In 2023, we expect to incur settlement accounting charges as a result of lump sum settlements for employees who retired in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Underwriting expense ratio 25.2 20.6 
 The underwriting expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the underwriting and operating expenses, net and amortization of DAC of our combined insurance operations (which excludes underwriting and operating expenses of our non-insurance subsidiaries) to net premiums written. The underwriting expense ratio increased in 2022 compared with 2021 due to an increase in underwriting expenses and slight decreases in net premiums written. 
 
 LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT 
 In 2022, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 40.2 million, related to the repurchases of a portion our 9 Debentures, the redemption of our 5.75 Senior Notes, and the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the FHLB Advance. In 2021, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 36.9 million associated with the repurchase of most of our 9 Debentures. 
 
 See Note 7 - "Debt" to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on our debt. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 Interest expense for 2022 was 48.1 million compared to 71.4 million for 2021. The decrease is due to the debt transactions discussed above.

BALANCE SHEET REVIEW 
 The following sections focus on the assets and liabilities experiencing major developments in 2022.

 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
 The investment portfolio decreased to 5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 6.6 billion), primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio due to the increase in the prevailing market interest rates and the reduction of debt outstanding. 
 
 The return we generate on our investment portfolio is an important component of our consolidated financial results. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of a diverse mix of highly rated fixed income securities. The investment portfolio is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
 Operating Companies (1) 
 Holding Company Preserve PMIERs assets Provide liquidity with minimized realized loss Maximize total return with emphasis on book yield, subject to our other objectives Maintain highly liquid, low volatility assets Limit portfolio volatility Maintain high credit quality Duration 3.5 to 5.5 years Duration maximum of 2.5 years 
 (1) Primarily MGIC 
 
 To achieve our portfolio objectives, our asset allocation considers the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest. This asset allocation is informed by, and based on, the following factors: 
 economic and market outlooks; diversification effects; security duration; liquidity; capital considerations; and income tax rates. 
 
 The average duration and embedded investment yield of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the following table. 
 Portfolio duration and embedded investment yield December 31, 2022 2021 Duration (in years) 4.3 4.5 Pre-tax yield (1) 
 3.0 2.5 After-tax yield (1)

 (1) Embedded investment yield is calculated on a yield-to-worst basis. 
 
 The credit risk of a security is evaluated through analysis of the security's underlying fundamentals, including the issuer's sector, scale, profitability, debt coverage, and ratings. The investment policy guidelines limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. The following table shows the security ratings of our fixed income investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Our investment portfolio was invested in comparable security types for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. See Note 5 Investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our investment portfolio. 
 
 Investments outlook 
 The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC raised the federal funds rate seven times throughout 2022 from 0.25 to 4.5 as it weighed the ongoing economic impacts of tight labor markets, supply chain disruptions and other macroeconomic factors that elevated inflationary measures. In February, 2023 the FOMC increased the federal funds rate by an additional 0.25 and signaled continued restrictive monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures. Market yields have increased in response to the FOMC s actions, which has resulted in a decrease in our fixed income investment valuations. The actions of the FOMC and other ongoing macroeconomic factors could create significant economic uncertainty, such as increasing recessionary concerns, which may result in a widening of credit spreads. Market volatility resulting from these factors may continue to impact our investment valuations and returns. 
 
 We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and volatility by maintaining a diverse mix of high-quality securities with an intermediate duration profile. 
 
 While higher interest rates may adversely impact the fair values of our fixed income investments, they present a near-term opportunity for investment into securities with yields in excess of the book yield on our portfolio. Increases in market-based portfolio yields are expected to result in higher net investment income in future periods. In addition to fixed income securities, we also hold cash and cash equivalents which yield returns that trend with changes in the federal funds rate. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 6 of the fair value of our investment portfolio consisted of securities referencing LIBOR. As discussed in our risk factor titled " The Company may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate ," the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, will cease publishing all USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. 
 
 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased to 327.4 million, as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 284.7 million), as net cash generated from operating was substantially used in financing activities. 
 
 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES 
 Our net deferred tax asset was 124.8 million at December 31, 2022 and is separately stated in our consolidated balance sheets as Deferred income taxes, net. Our net deferred income tax liability was 39.4 million at December 31, 2021 and is included as a component of Other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The change in our deferred income tax asset and liability was primarily due to the tax effect of unrealized losses generated by the investment portfolio during 2022. We owned 661.7 million and 426.3 million of tax and loss bonds at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. See Note 12 Income Tax es to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE ON PAID LOSSES 
 Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses decreased to 18.1 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: 36.3 million). The decrease in the reinsurance recoverable on paid losses is primarily due from the losses recoverable from reinsurers at time of termination of the 2015 and 2019 QSR Transactions (effective December 31, 2022), compared to the losses recoverable from reinsurers at time of termination of the 2017 and 2018 QSR transaction (effective December 31, 2021). In a reinsurance termination, amounts for any incurred but unpaid losses are due to us from the reinsurers. 
 
 OTHER ASSETS 
 Other assets decreased to 111 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 134 million), primarily driven by a change in the net funded status of our employee benefit plans. See Note 11 - "Benefit Plans" to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our employee benefit plans.

 LOSS RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE ON LOSS RESERVES 
 Our loss reserves include estimates of losses and settlement expenses on (1) loans in our delinquency inventory (known as case reserves), (2) IBNR delinquencies, and (3) LAE. Our gross reserves are reduced by reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves to calculate a net reserve balance. Loss reserves decreased to 558.0 million as of December 31, 2022, from 883.5 million of December 31, 2021. Reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves were 28.2 million and 66.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in loss reserves from 2022 to 2021 is primarily due to favorable development of 404.1 million on previously received delinquency notices, partially offset by loss reserves established on new delinquency notices. The reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves is impacted by the change in direct reserves and the percentage of our delinquency inventory covered by reinsurance transactions. 
 
 LONG-TERM DEBT 
 Our long-term debt decreased to 662.8 million as of December 31, 2022 from 1,146.7 million as of December 31, 2021 as we paid down our long-term debt in 2022. We repurchased 89.1 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 Debentures, repaid the outstanding balance of the FHLB Advance of 155.0 million and we redeemed the 242.3 million of aggregate principal outstanding on our 5.75 Senior Notes due in 2023. 
 
 UNEARNED PREMIUM 
 Our unearned premium decreased to 195.3 million as of December 31, 2022 from 241.7 million as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to the run-off of our existing portfolio of single premium policies outpacing the level of NIW from single premium policies. 
 
 OTHER LIABILITIES 
 Other liabilities decreased to 155.0 million as of December 31, 2022 (2021: 191.7 million), primarily due to decreases in our deferred income tax liability, accrual for premium refunds, and interest payable. These were partially offset by an increase in our liability for pension obligation. 
 
 SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY 
 The decrease in shareholders' equity represents a decrease in the fair value of our investments portfolio discussed above, repurchases of our common stock, and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net income in 2022.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
 We have three primary types of cash flows: (1) operating cash flows, which consist mainly of cash generated by our insurance operations and income earned on our investment portfolio, less amounts paid for claims, interest expense and operating expenses, (2) investing cash flows related to the purchase, sale and maturity of investments and purchases of property and equipment and (3) financing cash flows generally from activities that impact our capital structure, such as changes in debt and shares outstanding, and dividend payments. The following table summarizes these three cash flows on a consolidated basis for the last two years. 
 Summary of consolidated cash flows Years ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 650,012 696,317 Investing activities 410,485 (160,749) Financing activities (1,032,542) (527,290) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 27,955 8,278 
 
 Operating activities 
 The following list highlights the major sources and uses of cash flow from operating activities: 
 Sources + Premiums received + Loss payments from reinsurers + Investment income Uses - Claim payments - Premium ceded to reinsurers - Interest expense - Operating expenses - Tax payments 
 Our largest source of cash is from premiums received from our insurance policies, which we receive on a monthly installment basis for most policies. Premiums are received at the beginning of the coverage period for single premium and annual premium policies. Our largest cash outflow is generally for claims that arise when a delinquency results in an insured loss. Based on historical experience, we expect our future claim payments associated with established case loss reserves to pay out at or within 5 years, with the majority of future claim payments made within one to three years. Our claims paid activity slowed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily due to forbearance and foreclosure moratoriums put in place. We expect net losses and LAE paid to increase, however, the magnitude and timing of the increases are uncertain. 
 
 We invest our net cash flow in various investment securities that earn interest. We also use cash to pay for our ongoing expenses such as salaries, debt interest, professional services and occupancy costs. 

We also have purchase obligations totaling approximately 22 million which consist primarily of contracts related to our continued investment in our information technology infrastructure in the normal course of business. The majority of these obligations are under contracts that give us cancellation rights with notice. In the next twelve months we anticipate we will pay approximately 10 million for our purchase obligations. 
 
 In connection with our reinsurance transactions, we cede, or pay out, part of the premiums we receive to our reinsurers and collect cash when claims subject to our reinsurance coverage are paid. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in income taxes paid, increase in underwriting and operating expenses paid, a decrease in investment income collected, and a decrease in premiums received. This was partially offset by a decrease in losses paid, net of reinsurance settlements and a decrease in interest payments. 
 
 Investing activities 
 The following list highlights the major sources and uses of cash flow from investing activities: 
 Sources + Proceeds from sales of investments + Proceeds from maturity of fixed income securities Uses - Purchases of investments - Purchases of property and equipment 
 
 We maintain an investment portfolio that is primarily invested in a diverse mix of fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio had a fair value of 5.4 billion, a decrease of 1.2 billion, or 17.9 from December 31, 2021. Net cash flows provided by investing activities in 2022 primarily reflect sales and maturities of fixed income and equity securities during the year that exceeded purchases as proceeds were used in financing activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 primarily reflects purchases of fixed income and equity securities during the year that exceeded sales of such securities as cash from operations was available for additional investment. In addition to investment portfolio activities, our investing activities included investment in our technology infrastructure to enhance our ability to conduct business and execute our strategies.

Financing activities 
 The following list highlights the major sources and uses of cash flow from financing activities: 
 Sources + Proceeds from debt and/or common stock issuances Uses - Repayment/repurchase of debt - Repurchase of common stock - Payment of dividends to shareholders - Payment of withholding taxes related to share-based compensation net share settlement 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2022 primarily reflects repurchase of our common stock, repayment of our 5.75 Notes and our FHLB Advance, the repurchase of a most of our 9 Debentures and payment of dividends to shareholders. Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 primarily reflect repurchases of our common stock, repurchase of a portion of our 9 Debentures, payment of dividends to shareholders and the payment of withholding taxes related to share-based compensation net share settlement. 
 
 For a further discussion of matters affecting our cash flows, see " Balance Sheet Review " above and "Debt at our Holding Company and Holding Company Liquidity" below. 
 
 CAPITALIZATION 
 Capital Risk 
 Capital risk is the risk of adverse impact on our ability to comply with capital requirements (regulatory and GSE) and to maintain the level, structure and composition of capital required for meeting financial performance objectives. 
 
 A strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and is important to maintain a competitive position in our industry. Our capital strategy focuses on long-term stability, which enables us to build and invest in our business, even in a stressed environment. 
 
 Our capital management objectives are to: 
 influence and ensure compliance with capital requirements, maintain access to capital and reinsurance markets, manage our capital to support our business strategies and the competing priorities of relevant stakeholders 
 assess appropriate uses for capital that cannot be deployed in support of our business strategies, including the size and form of capital return to shareholders, and 
 support business opportunities by enabling capital flexibility and efficiently using company resources. 
 
 These objectives are achieved through ongoing monitoring and management of our capital position, mortgage insurance portfolio stress modeling, and a capital governance framework. Capital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. The focus we place on any individual objective may change over time due to factors that include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, changes at the GSEs, competition, and alternative transactions to transfer mortgage risk. 

Capital Structure 
 The following table summarizes our capital structure as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. 
 (In thousands, except ratio) 2022 2021 Common stock, paid-in capital, retained earnings, less treasury stock 5,124,251 4,741,685 Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax (481,511) 119,697 Total shareholders' equity 4,642,740 4,861,382 Long-term debt, par value 671,086 1,157,500 Total capital resources 5,313,826 6,018,882 Ratio of long-term debt to shareholders' equity 14.5 23.8 
 
 The decrease in shareholders' equity in 2022 represents a decrease in the fair value of our investments portfolio, repurchases of our common stock, and dividends paid, partially offset by net income in 2022. See Note 13 - "Shareholders' Equity" for further information. 
 
 DEBT AT OUR HOLDING COMPANY AND HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY 
 Debt obligations - holding company 
 The 5.25 Notes and 9 Debentures are obligations of our holding company, MGIC Investment Corporation, and not of its subsidiaries. We have no debt obligations due within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2022, our 5.25 Notes had 650 million of outstanding principal due in 2028 and our 9 Debentures had 21.1 million of outstanding principal due in April 2063. 
 
 In 2022, we repurchased 89.1 aggregate principal of our 9 debentures, redeemed the outstanding principal balance on our 5.75 Notes, and repaid the outstanding balance of our FHLB advance. 
 
 The 9 Debentures are a convertible debt issuance. Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, holders of the 9 Debentures may convert their notes into shares of our common stock at their option prior to certain dates prescribed under the terms of their issuance, in which case our corresponding obligation will be eliminated prior to the scheduled maturity. 
 
 See Note 7 - "Debt" for further information on our outstanding debt obligations and transactions impacting our consolidated financial statements in 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Liquidity analysis - holding company 
 As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had approximately 647 million and 663 million, respectively, in cash and investments at our holding company. These resources are maintained primarily to service our debt interest expense, pay debt maturities, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders, and to settle intercompany obligations. While these assets are held, we generate investment income that serves to offset a portion of our cash requirements. The payment of dividends from MGIC are the principal source of holding company cash inflow and their payment is restricted by insurance regulation. See Note 14 - Statutory Information to our consolidated financial statement for additional information about 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 71 

MGIC Investment Corporation and Subsidiaries 

MGIC s dividend restrictions. The payment of dividends from MGIC is also influenced by our view of the appropriate level of excess PMIERs Available Assets to maintain. Raising capital in the public markets is another potential source of holding company liquidity. The ability to raise capital in the public markets is subject to prevailing market conditions, investor demand for the securities to be issued, and our deemed creditworthiness. 
 
 Over the next twelve months the principal demand on holding company resources will be interest payments on our 5.25 Notes and 9 Debentures approximating 36.0 million, based on the debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. We believe our holding company has sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its payment obligations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 During 2022 and 2021, we used approximately 386 million and 291 million respectively, of available holding company cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Through February 17, 2023 we used approximately 42.6 million of available holding company cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. The repurchase programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time. See Overview - Capital of this MD A for a discussion of our share repurchase programs. 
 
 We may use additional holding company cash to repurchase additional shares or to repurchase our outstanding debt obligations. Such repurchases may be material, may be made for cash (funded by debt) and/or exchanges for other securities, and may be made in open market purchases (including through 10b5-1 plans), privately negotiated acquisitions or other transactions. See "Overview-Capital" of this MD A for a discussion of our share repurchase programs. 
 
 In 2022, we used 110.9 million to pay cash dividends to shareholders. On January 24, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per common share to shareholders of record on February 17, 2023, payable on March 2, 2023. 
 
 Our holding company cash and investments decreased 16 million, to 647 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Significant cash and investments inflows during the year: 
 800 million dividends received from MGIC, 
 94 million intercompany tax receipts, and 
 8 million of investment income. 
 
 Significant cash outflows during the year: 
 386 million of net share repurchase transactions, 
 248 million of 5.75 Notes redemption, 
 121 million of 9 Debenture repurchases, 
 111 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders, and 
 53 million of interest payments on our 5.75 Notes, 5.25 Notes, and 9 Debentures. 
 
 The net unrealized losses on our holding company investment portfolio were approximately 14.0 million at December 31, 2022 and the portfolio had a modified duration of approximately 1.1 years. 

Scheduled debt maturities beyond the next twelve months include 650 million of our 5.25 Notes in 2028 and 21.1 million of our 9 Debentures in 2063. The principal amount of the 9 Debentures is currently convertible, at the holder s option, at a conversion rate, which is subject to adjustment, of 77.962 common shares per 1,000 principal amount of debentures. This represents a conversion price of approximately 12.83 per share. We may redeem the 9 Debentures in whole or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 9 Debentures being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds 16.67 (adjusted pro rata for changes in the conversion price) for at least 20 of the 30 trading days preceding notice of the redemption. We expect to provide a redemption notice for the Debentures when this requirement is met and would expect the majority of the holders of the Debentures would elect to convert their Debentures into common stock before the redemption date. Under the terms of the Debenture, we may pay cash in lieu of issuing shares. 
 
 See Note 7 Debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt. The description in Note 7 - Debt" to our consolidated financial statements is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the notes and debentures. The terms of our 9 Debentures are contained in the Indenture dated as of March 28, 2008, between us and U.S. Bank National Association filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 12, 2008. The terms of our 5.25 Notes are contained in a Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 12, 2020, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, which is included as an exhibit to our 8-K filed with the SEC on August 12, 2020, and in the Indenture dated as of October 15, 2000 between us and the trustee. 
 
 Although not anticipated in the near term, we may also contribute funds to our insurance operations to comply with the PMIERs or the State Capital Requirements. See Overview Capital above for a discussion of these requirements. 
 
 DEBT AT SUBSIDIARIES 
 MGIC is a member of the FHLB, which provides MGIC access to an additional source of liquidity via a secured lending facility. In the first quarter of 2022, we prepaid the outstanding principal balance of 155.0 million on the FHLB Advance and incurred a prepayment fee of 1.3 million. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 PMIERs 
 We operate under each of the GSE's PMIERs. Refer to " Overview - Capital - GSEs " of this MD A for further discussion of PMIERs. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, MGIC s Available Assets under PMIERs totaled approximately 5.7 billion, an excess of approximately 2.3 billion over its Minimum Required Assets; and MGIC is in compliance with the requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans delivered to or purchased by the GSEs. Maintaining a sufficient level of excess Available Assets will allow MGIC to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements.

The table below presents the PMIERS capital credit for our reinsurance transactions. 
 
 PMIERs - Reinsurance Credit December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 QSR Transactions 1,228 1,129 Home Re Transactions 948 765 Traditional XOL Transactions 138 Total capital credit for Reinsurance Transactions 2,314 1,894 
 
 Our 2023 QSR transaction terms are generally comparable to our existing QSR transactions and will also provide PMIERs capital credit. Refer to Note 9 - "Reinsurance" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance transactions. 
 The PMIERs generally require us to hold significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans and the Minimum Required Assets required to be held increases as the number of payments missed on a delinquent loan increases. 
 
 We plan to continuously comply with the PMIERs through our operational activities or through the contribution of funds from our holding company, subject to demands on the holding company's resources, as outlined above. 
 
 RISK-TO-CAPITAL 
 We compute our risk-to-capital ratio on a separate company statutory basis, as well as on a combined insurance operations basis. The risk-to-capital ratio is our net RIF divided by our policyholders position. Our net RIF includes both primary and pool RIF and excludes risk on policies that are currently in default and for which case loss reserves have been established and the risk covered by reinsurance. The risk amount includes pools of loans with contractual aggregate loss limits and without these limits. MGIC's policyholders position consists primarily of statutory policyholders surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. A mortgage insurance company is required to make annual additions to a contingency reserve of approximately 50 of earned premiums. These contributions must generally be maintained for a period of ten years. However, with regulatory approval a mortgage insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35 of earned premiums in a calendar year. 

The table below presents MGIC's risk-to-capital calculation. 
 
 Risk-to-capital - MGIC December 31, (In millions, except ratio) 2022 2021 RIF - net (1) 
 56,292 50,298 Statutory policyholders' surplus 921 1,217 Statutory contingency reserve 4,597 4,056 Statutory policyholders' position 5,518 5,273 Risk-to-capital 10.2:1 9.5:1 
 (1) RIF net, as shown in the table above, is net of reinsurance and exposure on policies currently delinquent 1.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and for which case loss reserves have been established. 
 
 The 2022 increase in MGIC's risk-to-capital was due to an increase in RIF, net of reinsurance, partially offset by an increase in our statutory policyholder's position. The increase in statutory policyholders' position was primarily due to an increase in statutory contingency reserves and net income during 2022, offset by dividends paid to our holding company of 800 million. The increase in our RIF, net of reinsurance, was primarily due to an increase in our IIF and the termination of our 2015 and 2019 QSR Transaction, offset by a decrease in our reduction to risk on policies that are currently in default for which loss reserves have been established. Our risk-to-capital ratio will increase if the percentage increase in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The accounting estimate described below requires significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 LOSS RESERVES 
 The estimation of case loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgement by management. Changes to our estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated results and financial position, even in a stable economic environment. 
 
 Case Reserves 
 Case reserves are established for estimated insurance losses when notices of delinquency on insured mortgage loans are received. Such loans are referred to as being in our delinquency inventory. For reporting purposes, we consider a loan delinquent when it is two or more payments past due and has not become current or resulted in a claim payment. Even though the accounting standard, ASC 944, regarding accounting and reporting by insurance entities specifically excluded mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to loss reserves, we establish loss reserves using the general principles contained in the insurance standard. However, consistent with industry standards for mortgage insurers, we do not establish case loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently delinquent. 
 
 We establish reserves using estimated claim rates and claim severities in estimating the ultimate loss. 
 
 The estimated claim rates and claim severities are used to determine the amount we estimate will actually be paid on the delinquent loans as of the reserve date. If a policy is rescinded we do not expect that it will result in a claim payment and thus the rescission generally reduces the historical claim rate used in establishing reserves. In addition, if a loan cures its delinquency, including through a successful loan modification, the cure reduces the historical claim rate used in establishing reserves. To establish reserves, we utilize a reserving model that continually incorporates historical data into the estimated claim rate. The model also incorporates an estimate for the amount of the claim we will pay, or severity. The severity is estimated using the historical percentage of our claims paid compared to our loan exposures, as well as the RIF of the loans currently in default. We do not utilize an explicit rescission rate in our reserving methodology, but rather our reserving methodology incorporates the effects rescission activity has had on our historical claim rate and claim severities. We review recent trends in the claim rate, claim severity, levels of defaults by geography and average loan exposure. As a result, the process to determine reserves does not include quantitative ranges of outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur. 
 
 The claim rates and claim severities are affected by external events, including actual economic conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, interest rates or housing values, pandemics and natural disasters. Our estimation process does not include a correlation between claim rates and claim severities to projected economic conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, interest rates or housing values. Our experience is that analysis of that nature would not produce reliable results as the change in one economic condition cannot be isolated to determine its 

specific effect on our ultimate paid losses because each economic condition is also influenced by other economic conditions. Additionally, the changes and interactions of these economic conditions are not likely homogeneous throughout the regions in which we conduct business. Each economic condition influences our ultimate paid losses differently, even if apparently similar in nature. Furthermore, changes in economic conditions may not necessarily be reflected in our loss development in the quarter or year in which the changes occur. Actual claim results generally lag changes in economic conditions by at least nine to twelve months. 
 
 Our estimates are also affected by any agreements we enter into regarding our claims paying practices as discussed in Note 17 Litigation and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our estimate of loss reserves is sensitive to changes in claim rate and claim severity; it is possible that even a relatively small change in our estimated claim rate or claim severity could have a material impact on reserves and, correspondingly, on our consolidated results of operations even in a stable economic environment. For example, as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other factors remain constant, a 1,000 increase/decrease in the average claim severity reserve factor would change the reserve amount by approximately +/- 10 million. A one percentage point increase/decrease in the average claim rate reserve factor would change the reserve amount by approximately +/- 15 million. Historically, it has not been uncommon for us to experience variability in the development of the loss reserves through the end of the following year at this level or higher, as shown by the historical development of our loss reserves in the table below: 
 Historical development of loss reserves (In thousands) Losses incurred related to prior years (1) 
 Reserve at end of prior year 2022 (404,130) 883,522 2021 (60,015) 880,537 2020 19,604 555,334 2019 (71,006) 674,019 2018 (167,366) 985,635 
 (1) A negative number for a prior year indicates a redundancy of loss reserves. A positive number for a prior year indicates a deficiency of loss reserves. 
 
 See Note 8 Loss Reserves to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent loss development.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our investment portfolio is essentially a fixed income portfolio and is exposed to market risk. Important drivers of the market risk are credit spread risk and interest rate risk. 
 
 Credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads. Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. 
 
 We manage credit risk via our investment policy guidelines which primarily require us to place our investments in investment grade securities and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. Guideline and investment portfolio detail is available in "Business Section C, Investment Portfolio" in Item 1 . 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the characteristics of our interest bearing assets. 
 
 One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is modified duration. Modified duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to the changes in spreads. At December 31, 2022, the modified duration of our fixed income investment portfolio was 4.3 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 4.3 in the fair value of our fixed income portfolio. For an upward shift in the yield curve, the fair value of our portfolio would decrease and for a downward shift in the yield curve, the fair value would increase. A discussion of portfolio strategy appears in "Management's Discussion and Analysis Balance Sheet Review Investment Portfolio" in Item 7 .

 The substantial majority of our NIW is for loans purchased by the GSEs. The current private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements ("PMIERs") of the GSEs include financial requirements, as well as business, quality control and certain transactional approval requirements. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer s "Available Assets" (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its "Minimum Required Assets" (which are based on an insurer's book of risk in force, calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions). Based on our application of the PMIERs, as of December 31, 2022, MGIC s Available Assets are in excess of its Minimum Required Assets; and MGIC is in compliance with the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs.

 or more payments past due and has not become current or resulted in a claim payment. Even though the accounting standard, ASC 944, regarding accounting and reporting by insurance entities specifically excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to loss reserves, we establish loss reserves using the general principles contained in the insurance standard. However, consistent with industry standards for mortgage insurers, we do not establish case reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently delinquent. 
 
 Case reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim

Targeted Improvements for Long Duration Contracts: ASU 2018-12 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the amortization of deferred insurance policy acquisition costs. It also provides updates to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long duration contracts, which generally do not apply to mortgage insurance. The updated guidance requires deferred acquisition costs to be amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts, versus in proportion to premium, gross profits, or gross margins. In November 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-11 deferring the effective date, so that it applies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those annual periods. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, and determined it will not have a material impact. 
 
 Reference Rate Reform: ASU 2022-06 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 to provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform. It provided optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, extending the election and application from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 (originally December 31, 2022). The adoption of, and future elections under, this standard are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as the standard will ease, if warranted, the requirements for accounting for the future effects of reference rate reform. We continue to monitor the impact the discontinuance of LIBOR or other reference rates will have on our contracts and other transactions.

 The Federal Home Loan Bank Advance (the FHLB Advance was an obligation of MGIC. In the first quarter of 2022, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of the FHLB Advance at a prepayment price of million, incurring a prepayment fee of million. 
 
 In July 2022, we redeemed the outstanding principal balance of the 5.75 Senior Notes 5.75 Notes through a make-whole price of million plus accrued interest. The excess of the make-whole price over the carrying value, plus the write-off of unamortized issuance costs on the par value, resulted in a million loss on debt extinguishment. The make-whole amount was calculated as the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at the treasury rate defined in the notes plus 50 basis points and accrued interest. The 5.75 Notes were an obligation of our holding company. 
 
 2021 Transactions 
 In December 2021, we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our Debentures at a purchase price of million, plus accrued interest. The repurchase of Debentures resulted in a million loss on debt extinguishment on our consolidated statement of operations and a reduction in our potentially dilutive shares by approximately million shares. 

2020 Transactions 
 In August 2020, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which are due in 2028 and received net proceeds, after the deduction of underwriting fees, of million. In addition to underwriting fees, we incurred approximately million of other expenses associated with the issuance of these notes. 
 
 We repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our notes at a purchase price of million, plus accrued interest, using proceeds from the 5.25 Notes issuance. The excess of the purchase price over the carrying value, plus the write-off of unamortized issuance costs on the par value, is reflected as a loss on debt extinguishment of million on our consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 We repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 Debentures at a purchase price of million, plus accrued interest, using proceeds from the 5.25 Notes issuance. The repurchase of 9 Debentures resulted in a million loss on debt extinguishment on our consolidated statement of operations; a reduction in our shareholders' equity of million related to the reacquisition of the equity component of the Debentures; and a reduction in our potentially dilutive shares by approximately million shares. 
 
 Notes 
 Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. Prior to August 15, 2023, we may redeem the Notes at an amount equal to the sum of (a) the greater of: (i) the sum of the principal amount and the make-whole amount; and (ii) of principal; and (b) accrued and unpaid interest. The make-whole amount is the excess of: (1) the present value of the remaining principal, premium and interest payments that would be payable with respect to the note if such note were redeemed on August 15, 2023 (at of principal), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate specified in the notes, plus 50 basis points, over (2) the outstanding principal amount of such note. 
 
 On and after August 15, 2023, we may redeem the notes at of principal; on or after August 15, 2024, we may redeem the notes at of principal; and on or after August 15, 2025, we may redeem the notes at of principal; in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 The Notes have covenants and events of default customary for securities of this nature, and further provide that the trustee or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare them immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events of default after the expiration of the applicable grace period. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries, the Notes will become due and payable immediately. This description is not intended to be complete in all respects and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Notes, including their covenants and events of default.

Debentures 
 Interest on the 9 Debentures is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year. The Debentures are currently convertible, at the holder's option, at a conversion rate, which is subject to adjustment, of common shares per principal amount of the Debentures at any time prior to the maturity date. This represents a conversion price of approximately per share. If a holder elects to convert their Debentures, deferred interest, if any, owed on the Debentures being converted is also converted into shares of our common stock. The conversion rate for any deferred interest is based on the average price that our shares traded at during a -day period immediately prior to the election to convert. 
 
 The Debentures include a feature that allows us, at our option, to make a cash payment to converting holders in lieu of issuing shares of common stock upon conversion of the Debentures. We may redeem the Debentures in whole or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Debentures being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds (adjusted pro rata for changes in the conversion price) for at least of the trading days preceding notice of the redemption. 
 
 This description is not intended to be complete in all respects and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Debentures, including their covenants and events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2022. The Debentures rank junior to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness.

or more payments past due and have not become current or resulted in a claim payment. Such loans are referred to as being in our delinquency inventory. Case reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. 
 
 IBNR reserves are established for estimated losses from delinquencies we estimate have occurred prior to the close of an accounting period, but have not yet been reported to us. IBNR reserves are also established using estimated claim rates and claim severities. 
 
 Estimation of losses is inherently judgmental. The conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy, including unemployment and the current and future strength of local housing markets; exposure on insured loans; the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing (all else being equal, the longer the period between delinquency and claim filing, the greater the severity); and curtailments and rescissions. The actual amount of the claim payments may be substantially different than our loss reserve estimates. Our estimates could be adversely affected by several factors, including a deterioration of regional or national economic conditions, including unemployment, leading to a reduction in borrowers income and thus their ability to make mortgage payments, the impact of past and future government initiatives and actions taken by the GSEs (including mortgage forbearance programs and foreclosure moratoriums), and a drop in housing values which may affect borrower willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the value of the home is below the mortgage balance. Loss reserves in future periods will also be dependent on the number of loans reported to us as delinquent. 
 
 Changes to our estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position, even in a stable economic environment. Given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, including the effectiveness of loss mitigation efforts, change in home prices, and changes in unemployment, our loss reserve estimates may continue to be impacted. 
 
 In considering the potential sensitivity of the factors underlying our estimate of loss reserves, it is possible that even a relatively small change in our estimated claim rate or claim severity could have a material impact on loss reserves and, correspondingly, on our consolidated results of operations even in a stable economic environment. For example, as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other factors remain constant, a 1,000 increase/decrease in the average severity reserve factor would change the loss reserve amount by approximately +/- million. A one percentage point increase/decrease in the average claim rate reserve factor would change the loss reserve amount by approximately +/- million. 

The Losses incurred section of table 8.1 below shows losses incurred on delinquencies that occurred in the current year and in prior years. The amount of losses incurred relating to delinquencies that occurred in the current year represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on such delinquencies. The amount of losses incurred relating to delinquencies that occurred in prior years represents the difference between the actual claim rate and claim severity associated with those delinquencies resolved in the current year compared to the estimated claim rate and claim severity at the prior year-end, as well as a re-estimation of amounts to be ultimately paid on delinquencies continuing from the end of the prior year. This re-estimation of the claim rate and claim severity is the result of our review of current trends in the delinquency inventory, such as percentages of delinquencies that have resulted in a claim, the amount of the claims relative to the average loan exposure, changes in the relative level of delinquencies by geography and changes in average loan exposure. 
 
 Losses incurred on delinquencies that occurred in the current year increased in 2022, compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to an increase in estimated severity on current year delinquencies. In addition, there was a decrease in IBNR reserve estimates by million in 2021, while IBNR estimates increased by million in 2022. 
 
 In 2022, we experienced favorable loss development of million on previously received delinquencies primarily related to a decrease in the estimated claim rate. The favorable development primarily resulted from greater than expected cure rates, as borrower reinstatements and servicer mitigation efforts resulted in more cures than originally estimated. Additionally, home price appreciation experienced in recent years has allowed borrowers to cure their delinquencies through the sale of their property. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we experienced favorable loss development of million on previously received notices primarily due to the decrease in the claim rate on delinquencies received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was offset by the recognition of a probable loss of million related to litigation of our claims paying practices and adverse development on LAE reserves and reinsurance.

We receive the benefit of a ceding commission equal to of premiums ceded before profit commission. We also receive the benefit of a profit commission through a reduction of premiums we cede. The profit commission varies inversely with the level of losses on a dollar for dollar basis and can be eliminated at annual loss ratios higher than we have experienced on our QSR transactions.

 We have agreed to terms with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers for a reinsurance transaction with an effective date of January 1, 2023 with a similar structure to our existing QSR transactions that will cover most of our NIW in 2023 (with an additional quota share). Generally, we will receive an annual profit commission provided the annual loss ratio on the loans covered under the transaction remain below . 
 
 We can elect to terminate the QSR Transactions under specified scenarios without penalty upon prior written notice, including if we will receive less than for the Credit Union QSR Transaction) of the full credit amount under the PMIERs, full financial statement credit or full credit under applicable regulatory capital requirements for the risk ceded in any required calculation period. Early termination of the QSR agreements can also be elected by us for a fee, or under specified scenarios for no fee upon prior written notice. 

We incurred an early termination fee of million for the termination of our 2019 QSR Transaction effective December 31, 2022 and million for the termination of our 2017 and 2018 QSR Transactions effective December 31, 2021. We also terminated our 2015 QSR Transaction effective December 31, 2022. The reinsurance recoverable on paid losses due from reinsurers for loss and LAE reserves incurred at the time of termination includes million as of December 31, 2022 from reinsurers participating in the 2015 and 2019 QSR Transactions and included million as of December 31, 2021 due from reinsurers participating in the 2017 and 2018 QSR Transactions. 
 
 Ceded premiums written and earned, net of profit commission, decreased in 2022 due to the increase in profit commission. The increase in profit commission was a result of ceded losses incurred. Ceded losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily reflect favorable loss reserve development. See Note 8 - Loss Reserves for discussion of our loss reserves.

million as of December 31, 2022 and million as of December 31, 2021. The reinsurance recoverable balance is secured by funds on deposit from the reinsurers, the minimum amount of which is based on the greater of 1) a reinsurer's funding requirements under PMIERs or 2) ceded reserves and unpaid losses. Each of the reinsurers under our quota share reinsurance agreements described above has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better (or a comparable rating) by Standard and Poor's Rating Services, A.M. Best, Moody's, or a combination of the three. An allowance for credit losses was not required for 2022 or 2021. 
 EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE 

We have Excess-of-loss transactions XOL Transactions with a panel of unaffiliated reinsurers executed through the traditional reinsurance market Traditional XOL Transaction and with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Transactions ). 
 
 The 2022 Traditional XOL Transaction provides reinsurance coverage on eligible NIW in 2022. For the covered policies, we retain the first layer of the aggregate losses paid, and the reinsurers will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage is subject to adjustment based on the risk characteristics of the covered loans. 
 
 We can elect to terminate our Traditional XOL Transaction under specified scenarios without penalty upon prior written notice, including if we will receive less than the full credit amount under the PMIERs, full financial statement credit or full credit under applicable regulatory capital requirements for the risk ceded in any required calculation period. The reinsurance premiums ceded to the Traditional XOL Transaction are based off the remaining reinsurance coverage levels. The reinsured coverage levels are secured by funds on deposit from reinsurers, the minimum amount of which is based on the greater of 1) a reinsurer's funding requirements under PMIERs or 2) ceded reserves and unpaid losses. 
 
 The Home Re Transactions are executed with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Home Re Entities ). For the reinsurance coverage periods, we retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses paid, and a Home Re Entity will then provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. We retain losses paid in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. Subject to certain conditions, the reinsurance coverage decreases over a period of either or years, depending on the transaction, as the underlying covered mortgages amortize or are repaid, or mortgage insurance losses are paid. 
 
 The Home Re Entities financed the coverages by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes ILNs to unaffiliated investors in an aggregate amount equal to the initial reinsurance coverage amounts. Each ILN is non-recourse to any assets of MGIC or affiliates. The proceeds of the ILNs, which were deposited into reinsurance trusts for the benefit of MGIC, will be the source of reinsurance claim payments to MGIC and principal repayments on the ILNs. 
 
 When a Trigger Event is in effect, as defined in the related insurance-linked notes transaction agreements, payment of principal on the related notes will be suspended and the reinsurance coverage available to MGIC under the transactions will not be reduced by such principal payments. As of December 31, 2022, a "Trigger Event" has occurred on our Home Re 2019-1 transaction because the reinsured principal balance of loans that were reported 60 or more days delinquent exceeded a percentage of the total reinsured principal balance of loans specified under each transaction. A "Trigger Event" has also occurred on the Home Re 2022-1 transaction because the credit enhancement of the most senior tranche is less than the target credit enhancement.

 In selecting a discount rate, we performed a hypothetical cash flow bond matching exercise, matching our expected pension plan and postretirement medical plan cash flows, respectively, against a selected portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. The modeling was performed using a bond portfolio of noncallable bonds with at least million outstanding. The average yield of these hypothetical bond portfolios was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate. In selecting the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the classes of funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits of these plans. This included considering the trusts' targeted asset allocation for the year and the expected returns likely to be earned over the next years.

 The following describes the valuation methodologies used for pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan assets at fair value. 
 Domestic Mutual Funds: Securities are priced at the net asset value ("NAV"), which is the closing price published by the mutual fund on the reporting date. These financial assets are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 U.S. Government Securities: See Note 6 - "Fair Value Measurements" for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for U.S. Treasury Securities and Obligations of U.S. Government Corporations and Agencies. 
 Corporate Debt: See Note 6 - "Fair Value Measurements" for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for Corporate Debt. 
 Foreign Debt: These financial assets are represented by corporate debt securities issued by entities domiciled outside of the United States. See Note 6 - "Fair Value Measurements" for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for Corporate Debt.

 The pension plan has implemented a strategy to reduce risk through the use of a targeted funded ratio. The liability driven component is key to the asset allocation. The liability driven component seeks to align the duration of the fixed income asset allocation with the expected duration of the plan liabilities or benefit payments. Overall asset allocation is dynamic and specifies target allocation weights and ranges based on the funded status. 
 
 An improvement in funded status results in the de-risking of the portfolio, allocating more funds to fixed income and less to equity. A decline in funded status would result in a higher allocation to equity. The maximum equity allocation is .

The fixed income objective is to preserve capital and to provide monthly cash flows for the payment of plan liabilities. Fixed income investments can include government, government agency, corporate, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and municipal securities, and other classes of bonds. The duration of the fixed income portfolio has an objective of being within one year of the duration of the accumulated benefit obligation.

Statutory policyholders' surplus Contingency reserve 
 
 The decrease in statutory policyholders' surplus from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 is primarily due to dividend payments to the parent company (discussed below), offset by statutory net income. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 there were no contributions made to MGIC or distributions from other insurance subsidiaries to us. Dividends paid by MGIC are shown in table 14.2 below.

In 2020, MGIC distributed to the holding company, as a dividend, its ownership in the 9 Debentures held at an amortized cost of million. 
 
 STATUTORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 The insurance laws of jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the RIF (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the State Capital Requirements and, together with the GSE Financial Requirements, the Financial Requirements. While they vary among jurisdictions, the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of . A risk-to-capital ratio will increase if (i) the percentage decrease in capital exceeds the percentage decrease in insured risk, or (ii) the percentage increase in capital is less than the percentage increase in insured risk. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position ("MPP"). MGIC's policyholder position includes its net worth or surplus, and its contingency loss reserve. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, MGIC s risk-to-capital ratio was , below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements and its policyholder position was billion above the required MPP of billion. The calculation of our risk-to-capital ratio and MPP reflect credit for the risk ceded under our reinsurance transactions. It is possible that under the revised State Capital Requirements discussed below, MGIC will not be allowed full credit for the risk ceded to the reinsurers. If MGIC is not allowed an agreed level of credit under either the

Adjusted statutory net income is defined for this purpose to be the greater of statutory net income, net of realized investment gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend or statutory net income, net of realized investment gains, for the three calendar years preceding the date of the dividend less dividends paid within the first two of the preceding three calendar years. The maximum dividend that could be paid is reduced by dividends paid in the twelve months preceding the dividend payment date. Before making any dividend payments in 2023, we will notify the OCI to ensure it does not object.

 We have an omnibus incentive plan that was adopted on April 23, 2020. When the 2020 plan was adopted, no further awards could be made under our previous 2015 plan. The purpose of the 2020 plan is to motivate and incentivize performance by, and to retain the services of, key employees and non-employee directors through receipt of equity-based and other incentive awards under the plan. Awards issued under the plan that are subsequently forfeited will not count against the limit on the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the plan. The 2020 plan provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, as well as cash incentive awards. No awards may be granted after April 23, 2030 under the 2020 plan. The vesting provisions of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units are determined at the time of grant.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of MGIC Investment Corporation 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGIC Investment Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 

consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Valuation of Loss Reserves Primary Case Reserves 
 
 As described in Notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company establishes case reserves for estimated insurance losses when notices of delinquency on insured mortgage loans are received. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s recorded loss reserves were 558 million. A significant portion of total loss reserves relate to primary case reserves established for the Company s primary insurance business. Case reserves are established by estimating the 

MGIC Investment Corporation 2022 Form 10-K | 118 

number of loans in the delinquency inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. The Company s case reserve estimates are primarily established based upon historical experience, including rescissions of policies, curtailments of claims, and loan modification activity. The conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy, including unemployment and the current and future strength of local housing markets; exposure on insured loans; the amount of time between delinquency and claim filing; and curtailments and rescissions. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of loss reserves primary case reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the primary case reserves; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the claim rate and claim severity significant assumptions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of loss reserves, including controls over the development of significant assumptions related to the claim rate and claim severity. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the primary case reserves and comparing this independent estimate to management s recorded primary case reserves to evaluate the reasonableness of the recorded primary case reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing assumptions related to the claim rate and claim severity.

 MANAGEMENT'S CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, however, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which appears herein. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER 
 There are no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Business Combination Statute. Sections 180.1140 to 180.1144 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law regulate a broad range of business combinations between a Wisconsin corporation and an interested stockholder. Under this law, the Company generally cannot engage in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person becomes an interested stockholder, unless the Company's board of directors approved the business combination or the acquisition of the stock that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, in each case before such acquisition of stock. 
 Fair Price Statute. Sections 180.1130 to 180.1133 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law also regulate certain mergers, share exchanges or sales, leases, exchanges or other dispositions of assets in a transaction involving a significant shareholder and a Wisconsin corporation, unless specified minimum price and procedural requirements are met.

 Insurance Regulations. Wisconsin s insurance statutes and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of the Company unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Wisconsin (the OCI ). The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person directly or indirectly owns or has the right to vote more than 10 of the voting securities. In addition, the insurance regulations of other states in which the Company's subsidiary, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation MGIC is a licensed insurer require notification to the state s insurance department a specified time before a person acquires control of the Company. If such states disapprove the change of control, the Company's or MGIC's licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated. In addition, the OCI may seize securities owned by a person who has or is proposing to acquire securities in violation of the Wisconsin statute.

Exhibit 10.6 

The 2023 bonus plan for our executive officers determines bonuses by the extent to which three financial performance goals and various business performance objectives are met. 
 
 Threshold, target and maximum performance achievement levels have been established for each financial performance goal and each financial performance goal is assigned a percentage weight. A percentage for each financial performance goal is calculated based on the company s achievement against the goal. That percentage is multiplied by the weight for that goal. The individual financial performance goals, as generally described, and their weightings are ROE (calculated as adjusted net operating income, divided by beginning of the year shareholders equity excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and adjusted for financial impacts of GSE-mandated mortgage insurance cancellations inconsistent with prior business practices) (45 new insurance written (15 ), except that new insurance written during any month is included only to the extent such volume is projected to generate, as of such month in which it is written, a lifetime return, including the effects of quota share reinsurance, that exceeds a hurdle rate and insurance in force, as adjusted for financial impacts of GSE-mandated mortgage insurance cancellations inconsistent with prior business practices (15 ). 
 
 Performance against the business objectives is assigned a percentage in the aggregate, which is multiplied by 25 . The subjects addressed by the business performance objectives are transforming our business to sustain our success certain Corporate Sustainability considerations and ensuring we have the appropriate amount and form of capital to support our strategies and meet the needs of our stakeholders. 
 
 The resulting percentages for achievement against the financial performance goals and the business objectives are added. The resulting pay-out, if any, can range from threshold, which is 50 of target, to maximum, which is 200 of target. The Committee has discretion to decrease by as much as 10 percentage points or increase by as much as 10 percentage points the resulting percentage (the Bonus Pool Percentage ), but the Bonus Pool Percentage will not exceed maximum.
