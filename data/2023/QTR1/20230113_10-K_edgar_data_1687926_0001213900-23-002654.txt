company and our business refer, to The OLB Group, Inc., including its subsidiaries named herein. Certain statements,
other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and
expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. These

future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital,

Overview of Operations 

We are a Data Centric company
with business activities focused three main areas: 

ZEUUS Data Centers 

ZEUUS Energy 

ZEUUS Cyber Security 

All four divisions work synergistically
with each other in an synergetic ecosystem which enables growth and business protection. These technologies and divisions all stem from
the massive requirements in our Data Centers. 

While we are currently negotiating
for the purchase of three data centers, the recent acquisition by our ZEUUS Energy division of a unique, and scalable Wind Turbine technology
has us very excited. We have recently opened a 500 sqm, brand new research and development facility in Montenegro where the final designs
for the Wind Turbines are being tested and refined. We expect full commercial production of the Wind Turbines by the end of 3rd Quarter
2022. 

We are also in negotiations
for the acquisition of two cyber security companies and will update the market after we enter into definitive acquisition agreements. 

Our mandate and focus are
to harness the Cloud and provide all aspects of Data Services from protection to facilitation, to storage, to the sustainable energy consumption
at all our Data Center locations.

expense, offset with 1,624 of other income. 

Net Loss 

Our net loss for the year ended September 30,
2022 was 833,922 compared to 360,344 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in our net loss is due to our increased expenses
as discussed above.

of 58,623, consisting primarily of cash. We had total current liabilities of 1,314,734 consisting mostly of loans from related parties. 

Changes in Cash Flows 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the year ended September 30, 2022, we used
 715,816 of cash in operating activities compared to 282,239 for the year ended September 30, 2021.

proceeds from the sale of common stock of 125,626 and cash from related party loans of 584,900. For the year ended September 30, 2021,
net cash provided by financing activities was 439,973. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. Since its inception,
the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing of funds. 

3 

Going Concern 

We have not attained profitable
operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their
report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without
further financing. 

The Company has not yet established
an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs for the next fiscal year and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses
until it becomes profitable. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Refer to Note 2 of our financial
statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a summary of our critical accounting policies and recently adopting and issued accounting

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ZEUUS,
INC.: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of ZEUUS, INC. (the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and schedules
(collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
two years in the period ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered
recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are
matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We determined that there
are no critical audit matters.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2022, that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
our principal executive and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over our financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
using the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2022. 

We are aware of the following material weaknesses
in internal control that could adversely affect the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data: 

Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel
to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly
account for complex or unusual transactions 

Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place 

5 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial
reporting has inherent limitations, which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance,
interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel
factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process, which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses
in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion
or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2022, that have
materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS, RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

Director Independence 

For purposes of determining
director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which shares of Common Stock are
quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of Independent Officer means a person
other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company s Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 

According to the NASDAQ definition,
Bassam A.I. Al-Mutawa is not an independent director because he is an executive officer of the Company. 

Related Party Transactions 

Since March 20, 2016, (inception)
through September 30, 2022, Meshal Al Mutawa, the Company s former president, treasurer and director, and son of Bassam Al-Mutawa,
