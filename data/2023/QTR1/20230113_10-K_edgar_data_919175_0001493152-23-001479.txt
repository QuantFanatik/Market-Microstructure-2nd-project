PART
I 

Item
1. Business 

General 

Sugarmade,
Inc. (hereinafter referred to as we , us or the Company was originally incorporated on June
5, 1986 in California as Lab, Inc., and later that month, on June 24, 1986 changed its name to Software Professionals, Inc. On May 21,
1996, the Company changed its name to Enlighten Software Solutions, Inc. On June 20, 2007, Enlighten Software Solutions, Inc. was incorporated
in Delaware for the purpose of merging with Enlighten Software Solutions, Inc. a California corporation so as to effect a redomicile
to Delaware. On January 24, 2008, the Company changed its name to Diversified Opportunities, Inc. On May 9, 2011 we closed on a Share
Exchange Agreement with Sugarmade, Inc., a California corporation founded in 2010, and on June 24, 2011 changed our name to Sugarmade,
Inc. 

On
October 24, 2014 we acquired SWC Group, Inc., a California corporation doing business as, CarryOutSupplies.com Carry Out Supplies ). 

Our
Company operates much of its business activities through our subsidiaries, SWC Group, Inc., a California corporation SWC ),
NUG Avenue, Inc., a California corporation and 70 owned subsidiary of the Company NUG Avenue ), and Lemon Glow Company,
Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Lemon Glow ), SugarRush a California Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company SugarRush ), and SugarRush
5058, a California Limited Liability Company and 66.66 owned subsidiary of the company. 

Shares
of our common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets. Our trading symbol is SGMD . Our corporate website is
www.sugarmade.com. 

As
of the date of this filing, we are involved in several business sectors and business ventures: 

Paper
and paper-based products: The supply of disposable products to the quick-service restaurant sub-sector of the restaurant
industry, and as an importer and distributor of non-medical personal protection equipment to business and consumers, via our Carry
Out Supplies subsidiary. Carry Out Supplies is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies, has serviced more
than 3,000 quick-service restaurants, since inception. The primary products are plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups,
ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, edible packaging, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons, and similar products for
this market sector. This subsidiary, which was formed in 2009. 

Cannabis
products delivery services: Following the end of the COVID cannabis delivery boom, along with a challenging cannabis retail climate
from inflation, the black market, increased marketing expenses, and the cannabis excise tax moving from distribution to retail, the company
has decided to reduce investments in retail operations. The company made this decision as we see more promising opportunities to increase
shareholder equity by pivoting the business strategy to deploy capital to invest in cannabis real estate, cultivation, and wholesale
sectors vs. cannabis retail operations. 

After
discussions with ECGI, Inc. and the management of Nug Avenue, we could not find a path to short term profitability. The company then
decided to cease investing in Nug Avenue, which ultimately led to Nug Avenue discontinuing operations. 

As part of pivoting our business strategy, the company negotiated with
Indigo Dye Group Corp. Indigo to exchange our 32 stake in Budcars for a stake in a distribution and indoor cultivation
company in Santa Rosa, California. The company has already executed a share exchange agreement with Indigo. However, the final documents
and terms of the new company are still being finalized. The company expects to complete the documents and announce the transition to new
business post filing of this 10K. 

Selected
cannabis and hemp projects: On May 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement by and between Carnaby Spot Bay Corp, a
California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), Lemon Glow Company and Ryan Santiago
as shareholder representative, pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge with and into Lemon Glow, with Lemon Glow being the surviving
corporation (the Merger ). Upon the closing of the merger, Lemon Glow was merged into the Company. The purpose of the transactions
was to establish a licensed and permitted entity which Sugarmade would cultivate, manufacture, and distribute cannabis to the California
markets. At the time of the transactions, none of Lemon Glow, Merger Sub, or Sugarmade was permitted and licensed for such activities.

 Table of Contents 

On
October 28, 2021, Lemon Glow obtained a conditional Use Permit (UP) number from the Community Development Department of the County of
Lake, California, which the Company believes is an important step towards the conditional UP for commercial cannabis cultivation at its
property. The issuance of the conditional UP number by the County of Lake allows the Company to proceed with the state cannabis cultivation
license application, and potentially obtain certain applicable permits, such as from the Department of Cannabis Control, Department of
Food and Agriculture, Department of Pesticide Regulation, Department of Fish and Wildlife, The State Water Resources Control Board, Board
of Forestry and Fire Protection, Central Valley or North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, Department of Public Health, and
Department of Consumer Affairs, as may be required. The Company believes that obtaining the conditional UP number by the County of Lake
could be the first step toward full approval to cultivate cannabis on up to 32 acres out of the total 640 acres of the property. 

As
of the date of this filing, Sugarmade is working diligently on satisfying the conditions required by the County of Lake to allow the
Company to cultivate cannabis. It is the Company s intention to begin such activities at the earliest time possible, assuming permits
are ultimately issued. Upon issuance, the company will determine the amount of acreages to grow initially based on market demand and
pre-orders. However, no such license or permits have yet been issued, and applications are still pending. There can be no assurance that
any such license or permits will be issued in the near future or at all. 

Once
licensing and permits are issued, the company plans to divide the 32 canopy grow acres between four separate grow areas. These separate
grow areas will allow the company to start with a single area and expand with demand. While waiting for demand to rise, dividing into
separate grow areas will also provide an opportunity to lease the other grow areas to 3rd party or through partnership under Managed
Service Agreement to generate additional revenue for the company. 

We
believe the market demand will increase upon federal legalization allowing for interstate commerce of cannabis. Opening the doors for
out of state licensees to purchase California grown cannabis flowers. 

Once
fully completed, we estimate the output of 32 acres of canopy, will have the capacity of 64 tons of dry flower or 300 tons of fresh frozen,
requiring approximately 300,000 sq ft of storage space. We will continue to make plans to build more storage space while concurrent with
the licensing process.

Government
Regulations 

There
can be no assurance of continued inaction by U.S. federal authorities relative to our operations. Our business is at least partially
focused on cannabis, hemp, and associated products and the legal sales of cannabis permitted under California law. Cannabis is a Schedule
1 illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 811 (hereafter referred to as the CSA ). As is discussed
below, Hemp containing less than 0.3 percent THC is not a Schedule 1 drug under the CSA. Any actions by U.S. federal agencies could have
a significant negative impact on our abilities to generate revenue and/or profits. 

As
of the date of this filing, thirty-five states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. Territories currently have laws broadly legalizing
cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state-specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in
some states, cannabis, and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC are Schedule 1 drugs under the CSA and are illegal
under federal law. Active enforcement of the current CSA regarding cannabis and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC may directly
and adversely affect our revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial
holdings, and stated federal policy remain uncertain. 

On
August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal
and/or recreational use. The Cole Memorandum provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory
and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those
laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities
by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states,
prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated
market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state
efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies
should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to
protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to
continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms. 

On
January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under
the CSA. Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including
the August 29, 2013 Cole Memorandum . 

In
rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis
activity based upon factors including the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative
impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana
continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. 

On
March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a 1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as Rohrabacher-Blumenauer, 
which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states from implementing their own State laws
that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis. 

On
December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the Farm
Bill . Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so
illegal under the federal CSA. 

With
the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation containing less than 0.3 percent THC is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly
allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the
sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. 

Under
Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis
that produces the psychoactive high associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC
would be considered non-hemp cannabis or marijuana under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation
and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.

 Table of Contents 

Additionally,
there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm
Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan
that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the USDA ).
A state s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state s plan. In states
opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states
must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states
had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational
Health and Safety Act both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems. 

The
Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license
or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators
to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses. 

One
of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort.
Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further,
section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes
the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there
is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives. 

In
late January 2021, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers are in the process of merging various cannabis bills, including
his own legalization legislation. He is working to enact reform in this Congressional session. This would include the Marijuana Freedom
and Opportunity Act, which would federally de-schedule cannabis, reinvest tax revenue into communities most affected by the drug war,
and fund efforts to expunge prior cannabis records. It is likely that the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE)
Act would be incorporated. 

Other
federal legislation under review for possible submission includes the SAFE Banking Act (or Secure and Fair Enforcement Act), a bill that
would allow cannabis companies to access the federally insured banking system and capital markets without the risk of federal enforcement
action, and the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (or STATES Act), a bill that seeks protection for businesses
and individuals in states that have legalized and comply with state laws). 

Our
operations may also be affected by regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Enforced by FinCEN, the act requires us to report currency
transactions in excess of 10,000, including identification of the customer by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation
also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds 5,000 that we know, suspect, or have
reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify
sources of funds. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. If we fail to comply with
these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Active
enforcement of the current CSA on cannabis and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC may directly and adversely affect our revenues
and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA considering Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy
remains uncertain. 

As
a result of the conflicting state and federal laws regarding cannabis, our investments and operations of cannabis businesses in the U.S.
are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. Laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry are constantly changing, which
could detrimentally affect our operations. Local, state, and federal cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to
evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In
addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect
on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business.
These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns.
We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional
governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. 

Any
changes relative to the above areas, could significantly negatively impact our abilities to generate both revenue and profits.

Environmental
- Climate Change, Wild Fires, and Drought Conditions 

Hemp
and cannabis cultivation can be impacted by weather patterns and these unpredictable weather patterns may affect our operations in that
our supplier might not be able to fully our operations on a consistent basis. Severe weather, including drought, hail and excessive heat,
can destroy a cannabis crop, which could result in us having no cannabis to sell to our customers. These situations could substantially
affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. 

In
the future, our operations could also be affected by global climate change. Earth s climate has changed over the past century.
The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, sea levels have risen, and glaciers and ice sheets have decreased in size. The best available
evidence indicates that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the leading cause. Continuing increases in greenhouse gases
will produce further warming and other changes in Earth s physical environment and ecosystems. While our business operations have
seen no adverse effects from climate change, such issues could affect our operations in the future. Over the coming years, we plan to
closely monitor weather conditions to determine how changes could affect our future operations and plans for corporate growth. 

We
are also subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the
discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status
and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws
and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management
of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government.
It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of
soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations. 

The
2021 wildfire season in California experienced an unusually early start amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir
levels. According the State of California Division of Forestry, the long-term trend is that wildfires in the state are increasing due
to climate change in California. In terms of the amount of fires burned, the 2021 season has been outpacing the 2020 season, which itself
was the most significant season in the state s recorded history. According to the State, as of July 11, 2021 more than three times
as many acres have burned compared to the previous year through that date, with drought, extreme heat, and reduced snowpack contributing
to the severity of the fires. [ The state also faces an increased risk of post-wildfire landslides. While we have seen no negative
effects from such wildfires, our business operations could be affected by such conditions in the future. 

Our
future operations could also be affected by State of California and/or local governmental restrictions on water usage. Droughts are a
recurring feature of California s climate and are becoming increasingly severe due to climate change. According to the State
of California. In the last century, the most significant statewide droughts occurred during the six-year period from
1929 to 1934, the two-year period from 1976 to 1977, the six-year period from 1987 to 1992, and the five-year period from 2012 to 2016.
The 2012-2016 drought was one of extreme proportions, with record-high temperatures and record-low levels of snowpack and
precipitation. In 2021, California finds itself yet again in a drought, with water conditions at the end of the wet season far
below normal for the second year in a row. Continued drought in the California could affect our future business in that our suppliers
may not be able to provide products for us to sell to our customers, which would affect our ability to generate revenues and produce
profits. Drought conditions could also impact our abilities to cultivate cannabis in the future in that we may be unable to obtain adequate
water rights or access to suitable water to cultivate future cannabis crops, if we decided in the future to attempt cannabis cultivation,
although the Company currently has not such plans. 

There
can be no assurance that global climate changes and ongoing, or worsening, drought conditions and/or issue relative to wildfires within
the state of California will not negatively impact our operations during future periods. 

As
a result, such issues could severely impact our ability to generate revenues and profits.

RISK
FACTORS 

Cautionary
Statements 

The
discussions and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain both historical and forward-looking statements. To the extent
that the Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding the financial condition, operating results, business
prospects, or any other aspect of our business, please be advised that our actual financial condition, operating results, and business
performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in forward-looking statements. We have attempted to identify,
in context, certain of the factors we currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations. 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. Our auditors, WWC P.C., have indicated in their report on the Company s financial statements for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern due to our recurring losses from operations and substantial decline in our working capital. A going concern 
opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing
alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon the availability and terms of future funding, continued
growth, improved operating margins and our ability to profitably meet service commitments. If we are unable to achieve these goals,
our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue. If we ceased operations, it is likely that all of our
investors would lose their investment. 

We
face risks associated with strategic acquisitions. 

Our
business strategy includes strategically acquisitions of businesses and assets, some of which may be material. We plan to investigate
and acquire strategic businesses with the potential to be accretive to earnings, increase our market penetration, brand strength and
our market position or enhancement our existing product offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or successfully
complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. 

These
acquisitions may involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges,
including the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations: 

Any
 acquired business could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance
 with our anticipated timetable; 

We
 may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions; 

Acquisitions
 could cause our results of operations to differ from our own or the investment community s expectations in any given period,
 or over the long term; and 

Acquisitions
 could create demands on our management that we may be unable to effectively address, or for which we may incur additional costs. 

- 6 - 

 Table of Contents 

Additionally,
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through additional financing
from banks, through possible public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or through other arrangements. There
can be no assurance that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. 

Acquisitions
could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results.
We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities from acquired businesses or assets that arise after the acquisition and that are not adequately
covered by indemnities. Following any business acquisition, we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, financial
and other systems, and in retaining key employees and customers. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations,
our operating results, business and financial position may suffer. 

In
addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. We may record goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated
balance sheet in connection with our acquisitions. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur
charges relating to the impairment of these assets, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may have difficulties integrating acquisitions or identifying new acquisitions. 

A
major part of our strategy is to grow through acquisition. However, we may be unable to identify and consummate additional acquisitions
or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage the product lines or businesses that we have recently acquired or may acquire in
the future. In addition, we may be unable to achieve a substantial portion of any anticipated cost savings from acquisitions or other
anticipated benefits in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Moreover, any acquired product lines or businesses may require a greater
than anticipated amount of trade, promotional and capital spending. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the
assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies, personnel turnover and the diversion of
management s attention from other business concerns. Any inability by us to integrate and manage any product lines or businesses
that we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve a substantial
portion of any anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any
unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity. Moreover, future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional
indebtedness, being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

We
may need additional capital in the future, which could dilute the ownership of current shareholders or we may be unable to secure additional
funding in the future or to obtain such funding on favorable terms. 

Historically,
we have raised equity capital, including debt convertible into equity capital, to support and expand our operations. To the extent that
we raise additional equity capital, existing shareholders will experience a dilution in the voting power and ownership of their shares
of Common Stock, and earnings per share, if any, would be negatively impacted. Our inability to use our equity securities to finance
our operations could materially limit our growth. Any borrowings made to finance operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn
in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions, or increases in interest rates on borrowings that are subject to interest
rate fluctuations. The amount and timing of such additional financing needs will vary principally depending on the timing of new product
launches, investments and/or acquisitions, and the amount of cash flow from our operations. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy
our cash requirements, we may seek to issue additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. If our cash flow from operations
is insufficient to meet any debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations,
or dispose of assets in order to meet debt service requirements. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us
when needed or will be available on terms acceptable to us. Our failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions
could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Uncertainty
of profitability 

Our
business strategy may result in increased volatility of revenues, loses and/or earnings. As we will only develop a limited number of
products at a time, our overall success will depend on a limited number of products, which may cause variability and unsteady profits
and losses depending on the products and/or services offered and their market acceptance. 

Our
revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the market for our products. Our business
is also subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition. 

Because
of the anticipated nature of the products that we offer and attempt to develop, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating
results and these items could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors. These factors may include, among other things, the
following: 

Our ability to raise sufficient
 capital to take advantage of opportunities and generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses. 

Our ability to source strong
 opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns. 

Our ability to manage our
 capital and liquidity requirements based on changing market conditions. 

The amount and timing of
 operating and other costs and expenses. 

The nature and extent of
 competition from other companies that may reduce market share and create pressure on pricing and investment return expectations. 

We
cannot guarantee that we will succeed in achieving our goals, and our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results 

Some
of business initiatives in the hydroponic sector are new and are only in early stages of commercialization. As is typical in a new and
rapidly evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of
uncertainty and risk. Because the market for our Company is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict with any certainty the size
of this market and its growth rate, if any. We cannot guarantee that a market for our Company will develop or that demand for our products
will emerge or be sustainable. If the market fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors,
our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. 

Our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the
recent COVID-19 outbreak. 

Outbreaks
of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the
outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The slow-down in the global economy and the reduced levels of international and domestic travel
experienced since the beginning of January would affect our business adversely. The Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain
and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken
globally to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all
costs that may arise from all such possible events. We are still assessing our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on
our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact
from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.

We
have incurred losses since our inception, have yet to achieve profitable operations and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses
for the foreseeable future. 

Even
if we obtain more customers or increase sales to our existing customers, there is no guarantee we will be able to generate a profit.
Because we are a small company and have limited capital, we must limit our products and services. Because we will be limiting our marketing
activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to buy our products to operate profitably. Further, we are subject to raw
material pricing which can erode the profitability of our products and put additional negative pressure on profitability. If we cannot
operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations. 

For
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 we incurred an operating loss of 11,072,926. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we
incurred an operating loss of 5,926,134. At June 30, 2022 we had an accumulated deficit of 85,437,392. Although we have generated
revenues, they are insufficient to make the Company profitable. We plan to increase our expenses associated with the development of our
business. There is no assurance we will be able to derive revenues from the development of our business to successfully achieve positive
cash flow or that our business will be successful. If we achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profits on a
quarterly or annual basis. 

We
do not have sufficient cash on hand. 

As
of June 30, 2022, we had 161,014 cash on hand. These cash resources are not sufficient for us to execute our business plan. If
we do not generate sufficient cash from our intended financing activities and sales, we will be unable to continue our operations. We
estimate that within the next 12 months we will need at least 5,000,000 in cash from either investors or operations. While we intend
to engage in several equity or debt financings, there is no assurance that these will actually occur. Nor can we assure our shareholders
that we will not be required to obtain additional financing on terms that are dilutive of their interests. You should recognize that
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or obtain debt or equity financing, we will not be able to earn profits and may not
be able to continue operations. 

The
success of our new and existing products and services is uncertain. 

We
expect to continue to commit significant resources and capital to develop and market existing and new products, services and enhancements.
These products and services are relatively untested, and there is no assurance that we will achieve market acceptance for these products
and services, or other new products and services that we may offer in the future. Moreover, these and other new products and services
may face significant competition with new and existing competitors. In addition, new products, services and enhancements may pose a variety
of technical challenges and require us to attract additional qualified employees. The failure to successfully develop and market these
new products, services or enhancements could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
we are subject to raw material pricing which can erode the profitability of our products and put additional negative pressure on profitability.
Moreover, if we fail to accurately project demand for our new or existing products, we may encounter problems of overproduction or underproduction
which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation
and brand.

Third-party
suppliers could fail to fulfill our orders for parts used to assemble our products, which would disrupt our business, increase our costs,
harm our reputation, and potentially cause us to lose our market. 

We
depend on international third-party suppliers, including in The People s Republic of China, for materials used to assemble our
products. Changing federal tariffs could adversely affect our international third-party suppliers. We cannot predict the nature of any
future tariffs, laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations
or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our suppliers and our business. These suppliers could
increase prices to us, fail to produce products to our specifications or in a workmanlike manner and may not deliver the material or
products on a timely basis. Our suppliers may also have to obtain inventories of the necessary parts and tools for production. Any change
in our suppliers approach to tariffs or resolving production issues could disrupt our ability to fulfill orders and could also
disrupt our business due to delays in finding new suppliers, providing specifications and testing initial production. Such disruptions
in our business and/or delays in fulfilling orders would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations, as well as damage our reputation and brand. 

Even
if we expand our customer base, there is no assurance that we will continue to make a profit. 

Our
revenue growth has been derived from the sale of our products. Our success and the planned growth and expansion of our business depend
on us achieving greater and broader acceptance of our products and expanding our customer base. There can be no assurance that customers
will purchase our products or that we will continue to expand our customer base. If we are unable to effectively market or expand our
product offerings, we will be unable to grow and expand our business or implement our business strategy. Even if we obtain more customers,
there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to generate a profit. Because we have limited capital, we may be required to limit
our products and services. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to buy
our products to operate profitably. If we cannot market our new and existing products and services profitably, we may have to limit or
suspend or cease operations. 

Even
if we are able to expand our business operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth . 

If
we are able to continue expanding our operations, we may experience periods of rapid growth that will require additional resources. Any
such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate,
and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals.
In addition, we will need to expand the scope of our infrastructure and develop further physical resources. Any failure to expand these
areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with the business objectives
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Our
inability to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial
condition. 

Our
strategy envisions growing our business. We plan to expand our product, sales, administrative and marketing operations. Any growth in
or expansion of our business is likely to continue to place a strain on our management and administrative resources, infrastructure and
systems. As with other growing businesses, we expect that we will need to further refine and expand our business development capabilities,
our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. We also will need to hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees.
These processes are time consuming and expensive, will increase management responsibilities and will divert management attention.

If
we do not successfully generate additional products and services, or if such products and services are developed but not successfully
commercialized, we could lose revenue opportunities. 

Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings. To that end we have engaged in the process
of identifying new product opportunities to provide additional products and related services to our customers. The processes of identifying
and commercializing new products is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging
trends, our business could be harmed. We have already and may have to continue to commit significant resources to commercializing new
products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully
on commercializing those products because of errors in product planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely
fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and a reduction
in net sales and earnings. 

The
success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, timely completion, and introduction of these
products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance
that we will successfully identify additional new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner,
or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies
obsolete or noncompetitive. 

Our
business may suffer if we are unable to attract or retain talented personnel. 

Our
success will depend in large measure on the abilities, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of Management, as well
as other personnel. We have a small management team, and the loss of a key individual or our inability to attract suitably qualified
replacements or additional staff could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends on the ability of Management to form and
maintain key commercial relationships within the marketplace. No assurance can be given that key personnel will continue their association
or employment with us or that replacement personnel with comparable skills will be found. If we are unable to attract and retain key
personnel and additional employees, our business may be adversely affected. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive
employees. 

The
loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business 

We
depend on the continued services of our executive officers and senior management team as they work closely with independent associate
leaders and are responsible for our day-to-day operations. Our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers,
to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management
team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our senior management team, and do not believe that any of them are planning
to leave or retire in the near term, we cannot assure you that our senior managers will remain with us. The loss or limitation of the
services of any of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, or the inability to attract additional qualified
management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or independent
associate relations.

The
lack of available and cost-effective directors and officer s insurance coverage in our industry may cause us to be unable to attract
and retain qualified executives, and this may result in our inability to further develop our business. 

Our
business depends on attracting independent directors, executives and senior management to advance our business plans. We currently do
not have directors and officer s insurance to protect our directors, officers and the company against to possible third-party claims.
This is due to the significant lack availability of such policies in the cannabis industry at reasonably competitive prices. As a result,
the Company and our executive directors and officers are susceptible to liability claims arising by third parties, and as a result, we
may be unable to attract and retain qualified independent directors and executive management causing the development of our business
plans to be impeded as a result. 

If
we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our larger customers, our business may be harmed. 

We
do not have and are unlikely to enter into long-term fixed quantity supply agreements with our customers. Due to competition or other
factors, we could lose future business from our customers, either partially or completely. The future loss of one or more of our significant
customers or a substantial future reduction of orders by any of our significant customers could harm our business and results of operations.
Moreover, our customers may vary their order levels significantly from period to period and customers may not continue to place orders
with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods. In the event that in the future we lose any of our larger customers, we
may not be able to replace that revenue source. This could harm our financial results. 

Management
of growth will be necessary for us to be competitive 

Successful
expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively attract and manage staff, strategic business relationships, and shareholders.
Specifically, we will need to hire skilled management and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships to navigate shifts in the
general economic environment. Expansion has the potential to place significant strains on financial, management, and operational resources,
yet failure to expand will inhibit our profitability goals. 

We
import many of our products from Asian countries, including the People s Republic of China. Disruptions or a change in the tariff
situation may negatively affect our business 

Many
of the products we market are manufactured in Asian countries and are then imported to our facilities in the United States and ultimately
sold to our customers. There can be no assurance of the reliability of such channels and disruption would likely have a significant impact
on our business operations, our ability to retain customers and on our ability to generate profits. A significant change in trade tariffs
could also negatively affect our business operations. 

If
product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we will incur substantial liabilities. 

From
time to time, we may receive complaints from customers regarding our goods and services. We may become subject to product liability lawsuits
from customers alleging injury because of a purported defect in our products or services, claiming substantial damages and demanding
payments from us. Liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers
inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer
protection acts. We may be in the chain of ownership when we supply or distributes products, and therefore is subject to the risk of
being held legally responsible for such products. Given the nature of these products (including their relation to cannabis or for other
reasons), these claims may not be subject to insurance coverage or covered by insurance policies. Any resulting litigation, regardless
of the merits or eventual outcome, could decrease demand for our products, result in product recalls or withdrawals, be costly, divert
management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, and financial condition. Any litigation or even negative publicity generated as a result of customer frustration or disagreement
with the products or services could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

RISKS
OF GOVERNMENT ACTION AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY 

The
Farm Bill recently passed, and undeveloped shared state-federal regulations over hemp cultivation and production may impact our business. 

The
Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. Under Section 10113
of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state s governor and chief law enforcement officer to
devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of USDA. A state s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once
the Secretary of USDA approves that state s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will need to construct
a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. The
details and scopes of each state s plans are not known at this time and may contain varying regulations that may impact our business.
Even if a state creates a plan in conjunction with its governor and chief law enforcement officer, the Secretary of the USDA must approve
it. There can be no guarantee that any state plan will be approved. Review times may be extensive. There may be amendments and the ultimate
plans, if approved by states and the USDA, may materially limit our business depending upon the scope of the regulations. 

Laws
and regulations affecting our industry to be developed under the Farm Bill are in development 

As
a result of the Farm Bill s recent passage, there will be a constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the hemp industry
could detrimentally affect our operations. Local, state and federal hemp laws and regulations may be broad in scope and subject to changing
interpretations. These changes may require us to incur substantial costs associated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require
us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations, could disrupt our business and result in
a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations
or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. While we have not
identified any direct liabilities or business issue relative to the above items, there can be no assurance that any such issues will
not arise in the future. Thus, there can be no assurance the Company will not be subject to contingent liabilities in the future relative
to the above.

U.S.
Federal and foreign regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of cannabis laws and regulations and may negatively
impact our revenue, or we may be found to be violating the Controlled Substances Act or other U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws. 

The
Company does have plans to cultivate, process, market or distribute cannabis or any products that contain cannabis, some of our customers
do engage in such activities. Cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal
under federal law. Even in those states where the use of cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, has been legalized,
its use remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted
medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of
Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe
psychological or physical dependence. 

At
present, numerous states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical cannabis. Additionally, many states have approved
legalization of cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, for adult recreational use. The laws of these states relative
to cannabis as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis,
as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, use and possession illegal on a national level. If the federal government decides to enforce
the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, persons that are charged with
distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, could be subject
to fines and imprisonment. Any such change in the federal government s enforcement of current federal laws will cause significant
financial damage to us. 

The
approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change, which creates uncertainty for our business. 

As
a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, as not strictly defined in
the 2018 Farm Bill, investments in, and the operations of, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations.
Laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our operations. Local,
state and federal cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to
incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations
of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations
may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal
tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations,
interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and
procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH BANK AND INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

We
and our customers may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which may make it difficult to sell our products and service s
 and manage our cash flows. 

Since
the commerce in cannabis, as not strictly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, is illegal under federal law, federally most chartered banks
will not accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with cannabis. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry
often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for our
customers to operate. There does appears to be recent movement to allow state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to
the industry, but as of the date of this report there are only nominal entities that have been formed that offer these services.

 Table of Contents 

Financial
transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering
statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. Despite guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury
suggesting it may be possible for financial institutions to provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations
under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks remain hesitant to offer banking services to cannabis-related businesses. Consequently, those businesses
involved in the cannabis industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships. Our inability to maintain our
current bank accounts would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational,
logistical and security challenges and could result in our inability to implement our business plan. Similarly, many of our customers
are directly involved in cannabis sales and further restriction to their ability to access banking services may make it difficult for
them to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
are subject to certain federal regulations relating to cash reporting. 

The
Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by FinCEN, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of 10,000, including identification of the
customer by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including
any transaction that exceeds 5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed
to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us
if we fail to comply with this regulation. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Due
to our involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate
our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial liability 

Insurance
that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability, and directors and officer s insurance, is more difficult for us
to find, and more expensive, because we are service providers to companies in the cannabis industry. There are no guarantees that we
will be able to find such insurances in the future, or that the cost will be affordable to us. If we are forced to go without such insurances,
it may prevent us from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit our growth, and may expose us to additional risk and financial
liabilities. 

RISK
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INDUSTRY 

Our
business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in the target markets that we serve or reduced demand for the
types of products we sell. 

Demand
for our products is often affected by general economic conditions as well as product-use trends in our target markets. These changes
may result in decreased demand for our products. The occurrence of these conditions is beyond our ability to control and, when they occur,
they may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations. The inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay a premium
for our products due to general economic conditions or a downturn in the economy may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and
results of operations.

Changes
within the cannabis industry may adversely affect our financial performance. 

Changes
in the identity, ownership structure and strategic goals of our competitors and the emergence of new competitors in our target markets
may harm our financial performance. New competitors may include foreign-based companies and commodity-based domestic producers who could
enter our specialty markets if they are unable to compete in their traditional markets. The paper industry has also experienced consolidation
of producers and distribution channels. Further consolidation could unite other producers with distribution channels through which we
intend to sell our products, thereby limiting access to our target markets. 

We
are subject to certain tax risks and treatments that could negatively impact our results of operations. 

Section
280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with trafficking-controlled
substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act). The IRS has invoked Section 280E in tax audits
against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are permitted under applicable state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification
allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and
general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative
and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E
favorable to cannabis businesses. 

The
Company s industry is highly competitive, and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them
and advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete. 

We
are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches,
who may have far greater resources, more experience, and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may give our competitors
an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products less desirable to consumers or obsolete.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities. 

We
may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in the industry and such change may increase costs and competition that may
adversely affect our business 

Rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards characterize our market. The continued
growth of the Internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbates these market characteristics. Our future success will depend
on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our products.
We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of our products. In
addition, any new enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market
acceptance. We could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products and services or infrastructures to adapt to these
changes. 

We
also expect that new competitors may introduce products or services that are directly or indirectly competitive with us. These competitors
may succeed in developing, products and services that have greater functionality or are less costly than our products and services and
may be more successful in marketing such products and services. Technological changes have lowered the cost of operating communications
and computer systems and purchasing software. These changes reduce our cost of selling products and providing services, but also facilitate
increased competition by reducing competitors costs in providing similar products and services. This competition could increase
price competition and reduce anticipated profit margins.

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

We
may need additional capital that will dilute the ownership interest of investors. 

We
may require additional capital to fund our future business operations. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related
or convertible debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of holders
of our shares of common stock, who may experience dilution of their ownership interest of our shares of Common Stock. We cannot predict
whether additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Since our inception, we have experienced
negative cash flow from operations and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future. The issuance
of additional shares of Common Stock by our board of directors may have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest
and voting power of holders of our shares of Common Stock. 

We
have the ability to issue additional shares of our shares of preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause
your investment to be diluted. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The power of the Board
of Directors to issue shares of Common Stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of Common Stock or preferred
stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our shares of Common Stock, or shares
of preferred stock that may be convertible into Common Stock, may have the effect of diluting your investment. 

Our
shares of Common Stock qualify as a penny stock. As such, we are subject to the risks associated with penny stocks . Regulations
relating to penny stocks limit the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares and, as a result, our shareholders
may have to hold their shares indefinitely. 

Our
shares of Common Stock are deemed to be penny stock as that term is defined in Rule_3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Penny stocks are stocks: (a) with a price of less than 5.00 per share; (b) that
are not traded on a recognized national exchange; (c) whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system
(NASDAQ - where listed stocks must still meet requirement (a) above); or (d) in issuers with net tangible assets of less than 2,000,000
(if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or 5,000,000 (if in continuous operation for less than three
years), or with average revenues of less than 6,000,000 for the last three years. 

Section
15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 240.15g(c)2 promulgated under the Exchange Act require broker dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide
potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of
the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor s account. Potential investors in our shares of
Common Stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares of Common Stock that are deemed to be
 penny stock . 

- 17 - 

 Table of Contents 

Moreover,
Regulation 240.15g-9 of the SEC requires broker dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such
stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker dealer to: (a) obtain from the investor information
concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (b) reasonably determine, based on that information,
that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be
reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (c) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth
the basis on which the broker dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (d) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement
from the investor confirming that it accurately reflects the investor s financial situation, investment experience and investment
objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for investors in our shares of Common Stock to resell their
shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. Holders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, dated April
17, 1991, the market for penny stocks suffers from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: 

control of the market for
 the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

manipulation of prices
 through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

boiler room practices involving
 high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons; 

excessive and undisclosed
 bid-ask differential and mark-ups by selling broker-dealers; and 

the wholesale dumping of
 the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting
 inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. 

Our
Management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position
to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, Management will strive within the confines
of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock and to deposit certificates in paper
form or to clear shares for trading under Safe Harbor exemptions and regulations for unregistered shares. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing
that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-
dealers to recommend that their customers buy our shares of Common Stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and
have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for our investor to deposit paper stock
certificates or to clear our shares of Common Stock that are transferred electronically to brokerage accounts. There can be no assurances
that our investors will be able to clear our shares for eventual resale. 

Costs
and expenses of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act may be burdensome and prevent us from achieving profitability 

As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended
(the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our
legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant
strain on our personnel, systems and resources.

 Table of Contents 

The
trading market for our common stock is limited. 

We
are quoted on the OTC Markets Group s OTC Pink market tier under the trading symbol SGMD . This may result in limited
shareholder interest and hence lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained. 

Our
principal stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert a
significant control over matters submitted to the stockholders for approval. 

Our
officers and directors, and stockholders who own more than 5 of our common stock beneficially own a significant percentage of our common
stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors
often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. These stockholders, if they acted together,
could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by the stockholders, including the election of directors. The interests
of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend
on appreciation in the price of our common stock . 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We
currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate
declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock
will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value
or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. 

If
we fail to establish or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial
results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may, therefore, be adversely impacted. 

As
a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting for each of our fiscal years and to report any
material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting, which
must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we decide not to avail ourselves of the exemptions
provided under federal laws. Management has presently concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective and
has reported such conclusions in management s report in this annual report on Form 10-K. In the event that the Company s
status with the SEC changes to that of an accelerated filer from a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting
firm will be required to attest to and report on our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. Under such circumstances, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting are
effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our management s assessment, or may
issue a report that is qualified, if it is not satisfied with our controls, or the level at which our controls are documented, designed,
operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. 

Shareholders
and investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock
could be negatively affected, we could become subject to investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ),
or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could damage our reputation and
diminish the value of our brand name.

The
market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control. The market price of our
common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors: 

variations in our operating
 results and market conditions specific to our business; 

the emergence of new competitors
 or new technologies; 

operating and market price
 performance of other companies that investors deem comparable; 

changes in our Board or
 management; 

sales or purchases of our
 common stock by insiders; 

commencement of, or involvement
 in, litigation; 

changes in governmental
 regulations, in particular with respect to the cannabis industry; and 

general economic conditions
 and slow or negative growth of related markets. 

In
addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market
price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any
of the foregoing occurs, it could cause the price of our common stock to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful,
could be costly to defend and a distraction to our Board of Directors and management. 

The
application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and increase your transaction
costs to sell those shares. 

Our
shares of Common Stock are considered to be penny stocks as the SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1, which establishes the definition
of a penny stock, to include any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise
price of less than 5.00 per share and because they are not registered on a national securities exchange or listed on an automated quotation
system sponsored by a registered national securities association, pursuant to Rule 3a51-1(a) under the Exchange Act. For any transaction
involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in
penny stocks and that the broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity
and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a
disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer
made the suitability determination and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the
transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules.
This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.

Revenues 

For
the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, revenues were 4,715,822 and 3,979,049 respectively. The increase was primarily due to the COVID
19 pandemic which had significant impact on the restaurant supply industry for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

Cost
of goods sold 

For
the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, cost of goods sold were 1,900,496 and 2,153,311 respectively. The decrease was primarily due
to the COVID 19 pandemic which had significant impact on the restaurant supply industry. 

Gross
Profit 

For
the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, gross profit was 2,815,325 and 1,825,738, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the
higher margin from the Cannabis delivery business. The gross profit margin was 59.70 and 45.88 , respectively, for the years ended June
30, 2022 and 2021. 

Selling,
general and administrative, expenses 

For
the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8,028,913 and 5,767,335, respectively. The
increase was mainly due to increase in payroll, advertising and promotion expenses during the year ended June 30, 2022.

Non-operating
income expenses 

The
Company had total non-operating expense of 6,461,589 and 2,091,204 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase
in non-operating income is mainly related to the changes in fair value of derivative liabilities, and unrealized loss on securities. 

Net
loss 

Net
loss totaled 11,072,926 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of 5,926,134 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The
increase was due to above changes during the year ended June 30, 2022. 

Outstanding
Litigation 

From
time to time and in the course of business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief.
The amount of the ultimate liability, if any, from such claims cannot be determined. As of June 30, 2022, there were no legal claims
pending or threatened against the Company that, in the opinion of our management, would be likely to have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, as of the date of this filing, we were involved in the following
legal proceedings. 

On December 11, 2013, the Company was served with a complaint from two convertible note holders and investors in
the Company. On February 21, 2017, the Company signed a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the matter of Hannan vs. Sugarmade.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to pay the plaintiffs 227,000 to settle all claims against the Company,
which included the payoff of two notes outstanding. The parties had estimated the value of the notes at approximately 80,000. Third parties
had purchased the two notes during the year ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2022, there remains a balance, plus accrued interest on
the 227,000 and on the 80,000 due under the notes. 

There
can be no assurances the ultimate liability relative to these lawsuits will not exceed what is outlined above. 

Related
Party Transactions 

On
January 23, 2013, SWC received a loan from an employee for 40,000. The loan bears no interest. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the balance
of loans payable is 0 and 15,427, respectively. 

On
July 7, 2016, SWC received a loan from an employee. The amount of the loan bears no interest and amortized on a monthly basis over the
life of the loan. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the balance of the loans payable were 0 and 49,447, respectively. 

On
November 21, 2016, SWC received a loan from an employee. The amount of the loan bears no interest and due in September 30, 2017. As of
June 30, 2022 and 2021, the balance of the loans payable were 0 and 83,275, respectively. 

On
September 1, 2017, the Company had related party transaction with LMK Capital LLC, a related party company owned by Jimmy Chan, the Company s
CEO. The amount of the loan payable/receivable bears no interest and due on demand. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the balance of the
loan payable to LMK were 278,006 and 26,452, respectively. 

On
May 25, 2021, Lemon Glow received a loan from an officer. The amount of the loan bears no interest and due on demand. As of June 30,
2022 and 2021, the balance of the loans were 2,289 and 3,000, respectively. 

Leverage
Ratio 

Due
to net losses from the previous years, the Company s insolvency is a result of their stockholder s deficit. Total
liabilities amounted to 19,965,734 and the stockholders equity was negative 2,970,874, resulting in a negative
debt-to-equity ratio of -6.7:1.

Going
Concern 

The
Company sustained continued operating losses during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company s continuation as a going
concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, in which it has not been
successful, and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however,
the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
is endeavoring to increase revenue-generating operations. While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the
Company s products, management is also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including
the sale of the Company s equity and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired and our operating results
will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on us and/or our stockholders.
Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions
limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing
stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current
holders of our common stock. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We have primarily financed our operations through the sale of unregistered
equity, loans and convertible notes payable. As of June 30, 2022, our Company had a cash balance of 161,014, current assets of 1,083,483
and total assets of 16,869,910. We had current liabilities of 13,794,327 and total liabilities of 19,840,784. Stockholders deficit
was 2,970,874 as of June 30, 2022.

 Table of Contents 

Our
capital requirements going forward will consist of financing our operations until we are able to reach a level of revenues and gross
margins adequate to equal or exceed our ongoing operating expenses. Other than the notes payable discussed above, borrowings from our
bank and the production credit facility with our suppliers, we do not have any credit agreements or other sources of liquidity immediately
available to us. 

Given
estimates of our Company s future operating results and our credit arrangements with our suppliers, we are currently forecasting
that we will need to secure additional financing to obtain adequate financial resources to reach profitability. As of the date of this
report, we estimate that the cash necessary to implement our current business plan for the next twelve (12) months is approximately 5,000,000. 

Based
on our need to raise additional funds to implement our business plans for the next twelve months, we have included a discussion concerning
the presentation of our financial statements on a going concern basis in the notes to our financial statements and our independent public
accountants have included a similar discussion in their opinion on our financial statements through June 30, 2022. We will be required
in the near future to issue debt or sell our Company s equity securities in order to raise additional cash, although there are
no firm arrangements in place for any such financing at this time. We cannot provide any assurances as to whether we will be able to
secure the necessary financing, or the terms of any such financing transaction if one were to occur. The failure to secure such financing
could severely curtail our plans for future growth or in more severe scenarios, the continued operations of our Company. 

Capital
Expenditures 

Our
current plans call for our Company to expend significant amounts for capital expenditures for the foreseeable future beyond relatively
insignificant expenditures for office furniture and information technology related equipment and employees as it is part of the requirement
to build the infrastructure needed to support the current growth. At the same time, we will continually evaluating the production processes
of our third party contract manufacturers to determine if there are investments, we could make in their processes to achieve manufacturing
improvements and significant cost savings. Any such desired investments would require additional cash above our current forecast requirements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions 

Use
of Fair Value 

ASC
Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure
of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level
1 - observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

 Level
2 - include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 

 Level
3 - unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 

The
Company used Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities in determining the fair value using the Binomial
option-pricing model for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with ASC No. 606, Revenue Recognition. Sugarmade applied a five-step approach in determining the amount
and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in
the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. 

Substantially
all of the Company s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.

 Table of Contents 

Cash 

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of amounts held as bank deposits and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less. 

From
time to time, we may maintain bank balances in interest bearing accounts in excess of the 250,000 currently insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation for interest bearing accounts (there is currently no insurance limit for deposits in noninterest bearing accounts).
We have not experienced any losses with respect to cash. Management believes our Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk
with respect to its cash. 

Accounts
receivable 

Accounts
receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We grant unsecured
credit to our customer s deemed credit worthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by
management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance
is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company had accounts receivable net of allowances of 29,822 as of June 30, 2022
and of 435,598 as of June 30, 2021. 

Inventory 

Inventory
consists of finished goods paper and paper-based products ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. We value inventories
using the weighted average costing method (approximate FIFO costing method). We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of
future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realizable value of our inventory is less than cost, we make
provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value. 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment is stated at the historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for both financial and income tax reporting purposes as follows: 

Machinery and equipment 
 3-5 years 
 
 Furniture and equipment 
 1-15 years 
 
 Vehicles 
 2-5 years 
 
 Leasehold improvements 
 5-30 years 
 
 Building 
 31.5 years 
 
 Production molding 
 5 years 

Expenditures
for renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations
in the year in which they are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase
in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset, the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost
of the asset. 

Upon
sale or disposal of an asset, the historical cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of such asset were removed from
their respective accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the statements of income. 

The
Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition.
In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment
include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition and other economic factors. Based on this assessment, no impairment expenses for property, plant, and equipment was recorded
in operating expenses during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill
is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under
the acquisition method. Intangible assets represent purchased intangible assets including developed technology and in-process research
and development, technologies acquired or licensed from other companies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and
trademarks and tradenames. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Technologies acquired or licensed from other companies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and trademarks and tradenames
are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the terms of the agreement, or estimated useful life. We capitalized the cannabis cultivation
license acquired as part of a business combination. 

Derivative
Instruments 

The
fair value of derivative instruments is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations under non-operating income (expense). 

- 30 - 

 Table of Contents 

Our
Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially
recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated
statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Lattice Binomial model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could
be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Stock
Based Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation cost to employees is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the stock-based award, and will
be recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). We estimate
the fair value of employee stock options granted using the Binomial Option Pricing Model. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value
of stock options will include the exercise price of the award, the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, the expected
option term, the risk-free interest rate at the date of grant, the expected volatility and the expected annual dividend yield on our
common stock. We use our company s own data among other information to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected
forfeiture rate. Stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value
of the services rendered or the fair value of the stock-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. 

Loss
Per Share 

We
calculate basic loss per share by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without
considering common stock equivalents. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents, such as options and warrants.
Options and warrants are only included in the calculation of diluted earning per share when their effect is dilutive. 

Income
taxes 

We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

As
a result of the implementation of certain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which clarifies the accounting
and disclosure for uncertainty in tax position, as defined, ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain
aspect of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. We adopted the provisions of ASC 740 as of October
2, 2008 and have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns,
as well as open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and California as our major tax jurisdictions
and generally, we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2013 U.S. federal income tax returns. However, we have
certain tax attribute carryforwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute
of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized. 

We
believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will
result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant
to ASC 740. In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Our policy for recording
interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes. We have no interest
or penalties as of June 30, 2022.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures
(Topic 323), and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815), which clarifies the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method
of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. The guidance clarifies how to account for the
transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when considering observable transactions under the measurement alternative.
The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those
annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on the consolidated financial statements in the year ended
June 30, 2021. The adoption had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40) ASU 2020-06 ).
ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible
instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB s simplification initiative, which aims
to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements. 

On
March 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-03, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Accounting Alternative for Evaluating
Triggering Events ASU 2021-03 ). The amendments in ASU 2021-03 provide private companies and not-for-profit
entities with an accounting alternative to perform the goodwill impairment triggering event evaluation as required in ASC 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill
and Other Goodwill, as of the end of the reporting period, whether the reporting period is an interim or annual period. An entity
that elects this alternative is not required to monitor for goodwill impairment triggering events during the reporting period but, instead,
should evaluate the facts and circumstances as of the end of each reporting period to determine whether a triggering event exists and,
if so, whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. The amendments in this ASU are effective on a prospective basis
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that
have not yet been issued as of March 30, 2021. The Company adopted this ASU on the consolidated financial statements in the year ended
June 30, 2021. The adoption had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. 

On
April 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic
470-50), Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40): Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options 
 ASU 2021-04 to clarify the accounting by issuers for modifications or exchanges of equity-classified warrants.
The new ASU is effective for all entities in fiscal years starting after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-04 on its financial statements. 

On
July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments ,
which upon adoption requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments (that do not depend on a rate or index) as an
operating lease on commencement date if classifying the lease as a sales-type or direct financing lease would result in a selling loss.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities in fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2021. The adoption had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

On
July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Stock Compensation ASU
2021-07 to address the concerns from stakeholders about the cost and complexity of determining the fair value of equity-classified
share-based awards for private companies. It specifically permits private companies to use 409A valuations prepared under U.S. Treasury
regulations to estimate the fair value of certain awards under ASC 718. The Update is effective for private companies in fiscal years
starting after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-07 on its financial
statements. 

On
August 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 to require an acquirer to recognize and measure
contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue recognition guidance as if the
acquirer had originated the contract. That is, such acquired contracts will not be measured at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for
privately held companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on its financial statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Sugarmade,
Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sugarmade, Inc. and Subsidiary the Company as of June 30,
2021 and 2020 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, cash flows and the related notes to consolidated
financial statements (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements) for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows
for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

The
Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, recurring losses, and expects continuing
future losses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
evaluation of the events and conditions and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Deconsolidation
of Variable Interest Entities 

As
discussed in Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company holds an equity investment in Indigo Dye Group Indigo and accounts for its investment as a consolidated variable interest entity VIE for the year ended June 30, 2020. During
the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company ceased their control and deconsolidated the VIE and now accounts its investment under the equity
method. To reach its accounting conclusion, the Company claimed it holds no controlling financial interest in Indigo. We identified the
assessment of the controlling financial interest in Indigo as a critical audit matter. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

Evaluating
 if the Company has power to direct the activities of Indigo that the most significantly impact Indigo s economic performance. 

Evaluating
 the Company s obligation to absorb losses of Indigo that could potentially be significant to Indigo or the right to receive
 benefits from Indigo that could potentially be significant to Indigo. 

Investments
Impairment 

As
discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the investment as of June 30, 2021 was 441,407. The Company performs
an impairment testing at least once a year, or as deemed necessary due to the identification of a triggering event. The Company recognized
a total impairment charge of 43,800 during the year ended June 30, 2021. The Company tests the investment asset utilizing a discounted
cash flow method to determine the estimated fair value. 

We
identified the assessment of the fair value of the Company s investments to be a critical audit matter. The discount rates and
revenue growth rates are subjective measures and changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the Company s
assessment of the investment s fair value. Inherent uncertainties exist related to the Company s revenue growth rates and
how various economic and other factors, including the projected impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect the Company s forecasted
assumptions of future cash flows. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment, including
the need for specialized skills and knowledge. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address the investments impairment included the following: 

Assessing
 the Company s ability to estimate future cash flows, including projected revenues, by comparing the Company s historical
 cash flow forecasts by investment to actual results. 

Evaluating
 the reasonableness of assumptions used in the Company s estimate of fair value, including the revenue growth rate, given the
 inherent uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Utilizing
 personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology applied
 in estimating the fair values of the Company s investments, discount rate used in the Company s estimate of the fair
 value, including performing sensitivity analysis. 

Intangible
Assets Impairment 

As
discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s intangible assets were 10.6 million as of June
30, 2021. The Company s intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with business acquisitions. The intangible
assets mainly related to the cannabis cultivation license. In accordance with ASC 360, 
definite-lived intangible assets were reviewed for impairment if a triggering event occurred. As of June 30, 2021, no triggering
event was identified. As a result of that analysis, the Company concluded there was no impairment for intangible assets as of such
date. 

- 35 - 

 Table of Contents 

We
identified the intangible assets impairment assessment as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions
management used in the analysis. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required
a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals
with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address the intangible assets impairment included the following: 

Performed
 qualitative procedures to identify if any indications to the impairment. 

Performed
 a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions, particularly as it relates to revenue growth rates and operating margins and evaluating
 the impact on the fair values that would result from changes in the assumptions. 

Utilizing
 personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology applied
 in estimating the fair values of the Company s intangible assets and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions used
 in valuation. 

Goodwill
Impairment 

As
discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s goodwill was 757,648 as of June 30, 2021. The Company s
goodwill was recognized in connection with business acquisitions. In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill is reviewed for impairment at
least once a year. As of June 30, 2021, the Company concluded there was no impairment for intangible assets as of such date. 

We
identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis for goodwill as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and
assumptions management used in the analysis. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions
required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals
with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address the goodwill impairment included the following:

Utilizing
 personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in analysis to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology applied
 in estimating the fair values of the Company s goodwill and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions used in analysis. 

Convertible
Notes 

As
discussed in Notes 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had various debt instruments which included conversion
features requiring bifurcation and separate accounting. Management evaluated the required accounting, significant estimates, and judgments
around the valuation for these embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives were initially measured at fair value and have subsequently
been remeasured to fair value at each reporting period and at settlement. 

There
is no current observable market for these types of features and, as such, the Company determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives
using a binomial option pricing model to measure the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment
and effort was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the conclusions reached by management, as well as the inputs to the
Company s binomial option pricing model. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

We
 obtained an understanding of the controls and processes surrounding the evaluation, initial measurement and revaluation of the bifurcated
 derivatives. 

We
 evaluated management s assessment and the conclusions reached to ensure these instruments were recorded in accordance with
 the relevant accounting guidance. 

We
 evaluated the fair value of the bifurcated derivatives that included testing the valuation models and assumptions utilized by management.
 We reviewed and tested the fair value model used, significant assumptions, and underlying data used in the model.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To: 
 The
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Sugarmade,
 Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Sugarmade, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the
 Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in
stockholders (deficit) equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Emphasis
of Matter Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses during the year ended June 30, 2021, and had a working capital
deficit, which had raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. As of and for the year ended June 30, 2022,
the Company continued to incur substantial losses during the year ended June 30, 2022, and as of June 30, 2022, the Company had a net
working capital deficit; accordingly, the substantial doubt that the Company will continue as a going concern that existed at June 30,
2021, was not alleviated, and therefore, the as of June 30, 2022 and up to the date of this report, the substantial doubt the Company
will continue as a going concern still exists. Management s plans to address this substantial doubt is set forth in Note 2. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Intangible
Assets 

We
assessed the carrying value of intangible assets as a critical audit matter. As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements,
as of June 30, 2022, the Company s intangible assets balance was 10.6 million which was quantitatively material to the financial
statements as a whole, and the account requires challenging, subjective and complex judgment and assumptions regarding the estimation
of future cash flows to determine that the balance is reasonable and not materially misstated. 

- 37 - 

 Table of Contents 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address the carrying value of the intangible assets and related the impairment included the following: 

Performed
 a sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions from management by researching wholesale and retail market value of cannabis products,
 particularly as it relates to revenue growth rates and operating margins, and evaluating the impact on the fair values that would
 result from changes in the assumptions. 

Performed
 quantitative analysis by using an undiscounted cash flow calculation model to test if any impairment exists and developed a range
 of independent estimates for assumption valuation ratios and compared those to ratios selected by management 

Utilized
 personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology applied
 in estimating the fair values of the Company s intangible assets. 

Performed
 active market research to obtain the fair market value of the cannabis for valuation and for our calculation model data, in-person
 inquiry with the local governmental agricultural department to obtain the license permit status and using the historical approval
 data to estimate the foreseen permit approval rate which applies in our calculation model. 

Obtained
 the third-party report from the professional consultant to verify the license application process and evaluated their opinion for
 the approval status of the agricultural permit. 

The
accounts relevant to this critical audit matter include the gross value of the intangible assets, the related accumulated amortization, amortization
expense and impairment expense, and the related disclosure in the accompanying notes 2 and 14 to the financial statements. 

Goodwill 

We
assessed the carrying value of goodwill as a critical audit matter. As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company s goodwill balance was 757,648 as of June 30, 2022. The account requires challenging, subjective, and complex judgment
and assumptions regarding the estimation of future cash flows and finding the appropriate weighted average cost of capital to determine
that the balance is reasonable, properly disclosed, and not materially misstated. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address the goodwill impairment included the following: 

Evaluated
 management of significant assumptions and estimates which is particularly related to future revenue growth rates, capital expenditures,
 operating margins on evaluating the impact on the fair values according to the changes in the assumptions 

Performed
 quantitative analysis by using valuation model to evaluate the fair value and test whether impairment exists 

Utilized
 personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in analysis to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology applied
 in estimating the fair values of the Company s goodwill and evaluating the reasonableness of certain ratios and assumptions
 used in analysis. 

The accounts relevant to this critical audit matter
include the gross value of the goodwill, and related impairment expense, and the related disclosure in the accompanying note 15 to the
financial statements. 

Convertible
Notes and Derivative Liabilities 

We assessed the carrying value and allocation of the
convertible notes and related derivative liabilities as a critical audit matter. As discussed in notes 20 and 21 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company had various debt instruments which included conversion features requiring bifurcation and separate accounting.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company s convertible notes and derivate liabilities balance were 1,467,437 and 5,521,284, respectively
which these amounts were material to the financial statements as a whole, and the account requires challenging, subjective, and complex
judgment and assumptions in order to properly value and allocate such value to the convertible notes and the derivative liabilities; additionally,
the finding appropriate comparable market data and inputs for the valuation models employed can be challenging; selection of the appropriate
model to measure the fair value of the embedded derivatives requires a great deal of judgment; the Company s management employed
binomial option pricing model to measure the fair value of the bifurcated securities; these circumstances give rise to complex judgment
in determining the management s estimate of the balance is reasonable and not materially misstated. 

Our
principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

We
 obtained an understanding of the controls and processes surrounding the evaluation, initial measurement and revaluation of the bifurcated
 derivatives. 

We
 evaluated management s assessment and the conclusions reached to ensure these instruments were recorded in accordance with
 the relevant accounting guidance. 

We
 evaluated the value of these debt instruments by sending confirmation and vouching the related agreement 

We
 reviewed and tested the significant assumption and recalculated related underlying data used in the valuation model used by the management
 to verify the reasonableness of valuation models used. 

We performed research to determine that the model was appropriate to the
facts and circumstances. 

The accounts relevant to this critical audit matter
include the gross value of the notes, the related debt discount amortization account, and amortization of debt discount, and the gross
value of the derivative liabilities, and the related change in fair value of derivative liabilities and the related disclosures in the
accompanying notes 20 and 21 to the financial statements.

owned subsidiary of the Company NUG Avenue ), and Lemon Glow Company,
Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Lemon Glow ). 

Shares
of our common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets. Our trading symbol is SGMD . Our corporate website is
www.sugarmade.com. 

As
of the date of this filing, we are involved in several business sectors and business ventures: 

Paper
and paper-based products: The supply of consumable products to the quick-service restaurant sub-sector of the restaurant industry,
and as an importer and distributor of non-medical personal protection equipment to business and consumers, via our Carry Out Supplies
subsidiary. Carry Out Supplies is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies, servicing more than 2,000 quick-service
restaurants. The primary products are plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, edible
packaging, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons, and similar products for this market sector. This subsidiary, which was
formed in 2009. 

Cannabis
products delivery services: Following the end of the COVID cannabis delivery boom, along with a challenging cannabis retail climate
from inflation, the black market, increased marketing expenses, and the cannabis excise tax moving from distribution to retail, the company
has decided to reduce investments in retail operations. The company made this decision as we see more promising opportunities to increase
shareholder equity by pivoting the business strategy to deploy capital to invest in cannabis real estate, cultivation, and wholesale
sectors vs. cannabis retail operations. 

After
discussions with ECGI, Inc. and the management of Nug Avenue, we could not find a path to short term profitability. The company then
decided to cease investing in Nug Avenue, which ultimately led to Nug Avenue discontinuing operations. 

As
part of pivoting our business strategy, the company negotiated with Indigo Dye Group Corp. Indigo to exchange our 
stake in Budcars for a stake in a distribution and indoor cultivation company in Santa Rosa, California. The company has already executed
a share exchange agreement with Indigo. However, the final documents and terms of the new company are still being finalized. The company
expects to complete the documents and announce the transition to new business post filing of this 10K. 

Selected
cannabis and hemp projects: On May 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement by and between Carnaby Spot Bay Corp, a
California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), Lemon Glow Company and Ryan Santiago
as shareholder representative, pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge with and into Lemon Glow, with Lemon Glow being the surviving
corporation (the Merger ). Upon the closing of the merger, Lemon Glow was merged into the Company. The purpose of the transactions
was to establish a licensed and permitted entity which Sugarmade would cultivate, manufacture, and distribute cannabis to the California
markets. At the time of the transactions, none of Lemon Glow, Merger Sub, or Sugarmade was permitted and licensed for such activities. 

On
October 28, 2021, Lemon Glow obtained a conditional Use Permit (UP) number from the Community Development Department of the County of
Lake, California, which the Company believes is an important step towards the conditional UP for commercial cannabis cultivation at its
property. The issuance of the conditional UP number by the County of Lake allows the Company to proceed with the state cannabis cultivation
license application, and potentially obtain certain applicable permits, such as from the Department of Cannabis Control, Department of
Food and Agriculture, Department of Pesticide Regulation, Department of Fish and Wildlife, The State Water Resources Control Board, Board
of Forestry and Fire Protection, Central Valley or North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, Department of Public Health, and
Department of Consumer Affairs, as may be required. The Company believes that obtaining the conditional UP number by the County of Lake
could be the first step toward full approval to cultivate cannabis on up to 32 acres out of the total 640 acres of the property. 

As
of the date of this filing, Sugarmade is working diligently on satisfying the conditions required by the County of Lake to allow the
Company to cultivate cannabis. It is the Company s intention to begin such activities at the earliest time possible, assuming permits
are ultimately issued. Upon issuance, the company will determine the amount of acreages to grow initially based on market demand and
pre-orders. However, no such license or permits have yet been issued, and applications are still pending. There can be no assurance that
any such license or permits will be issued in the near future or at all. 

Once
licensing and permits are issued, the company plans to divide the 32 canopy grow acres between four separate grow areas. These separate
grow areas will allow the company to start with a single area and expand with demand. While waiting for demand to rise, dividing into
separate grow areas will also provide an opportunity to lease the other grow areas to 3rd party or through partnership under Managed
Service Agreement to generate additional revenue for the company. 

We
believe the market demand will increase upon federal legalization allowing for interstate commerce of cannabis. Opening the doors for
out of state licensees to purchase California grown cannabis flowers. 

Once
fully completed, we estimate the output of 32 acres of canopy, will have the capacity of 64 tons of dry flower or 300 tons of fresh frozen,
requiring approximately 300,000 sq ft of storage space. We will continue to make plans to build more storage space while concurrent with
the licensing process. 

The
most significant effects of the adoption of the new standard relate to the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our
balance sheet for office operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. 

The
new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity s ongoing accounting. The Company has also elected the short-term
leases recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means that the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities,
and this includes not recognizing ROU assets and lease liabilities, for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. The
Company also currently expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases. All existing
leases are reported under this rule. 

Under
ASC 840, leases were classified as either capital or operating, and the classification significantly impacted the effect the contract
had on the company s financial statements. Capital lease classification resulted in a liability that was recorded on a company s
balance sheet, whereas operating leases did not impact the balance sheet.

Expenditures
for renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations
in the year in which they are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase
in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset, the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost
of the asset. 

Upon
sale or disposal of an asset, the historical cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of such asset were removed from
their respective accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the statements of income. 

The
Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition.
In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment
include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition and other economic factors. Based on this assessment, impairment expenses for property, plant, and equipment was recorded
in operating expenses during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

Recoverability
of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows,
an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair
value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
Based on its review, there was 0 and impairment loss of its long-lived assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

On
July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments ,
which upon adoption requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments (that do not depend on a rate or index) as an
operating lease on commencement date if classifying the lease as a sales-type or direct financing lease would result in a selling loss.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities in fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2021. The adoption had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the year ended June 30, 2022. 

On
July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Stock Compensation ASU
2021-07 to address the concerns from stakeholders about the cost and complexity of determining the fair value of equity-classified
share-based awards for private companies. It specifically permits private companies to use 409A valuations prepared under U.S. Treasury
regulations to estimate the fair value of certain awards under ASC 718. The Update is effective for private companies in fiscal years
starting after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-07 on its financial
statements. 

On
August 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 to require an acquirer to recognize and measure
contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue recognition guidance as if the
acquirer had originated the contract. That is, such acquired contracts will not be measured at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for
privately held companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08 on its financial statements.

Assumptions
in the Allocations of Purchase Price 

Management
prepared the purchase price allocations for Lemon Glow relied upon reports of a third party valuation expert to calculate the fair value
of certain acquired assets, which primarily included identifiable intangible assets, and property and equipment. 

Estimates
of fair value require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to
the acquired workforce, and other benefits that the Company believes will result from integrating the operations of the Lemon Glow with
the operations of Sugarmade . Certain liabilities included in the purchase price allocations are based on management s best estimates
of the amounts to be paid or settled and based on information available at the time the purchase price allocations were prepared. 

The
fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired from the Lemon Glow was estimated using an income approach. Under the income
approach, an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership
of the asset. Indications of value are developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of
return. More specifically, the fair value of the cannabis cultivation license was determined using the MPEEM method. MPEEM is an income
approach to fair value measurement attributable to a specific intangible asset being valued from the asset grouping s overall cash-flow
stream. MPEEM isolates the expected future discounted cash-flow stream to its net present value. Significant factors considered in the
calculation of the cannabis cultivation license intangible assets were the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood
of government regulation and market acceptance. 

In
connection with the acquisition of Lemon Glow, the Company has assumed certain operating liabilities which are included in the respective
purchase price allocations above. 

Goodwill
recorded in connection with Lemon Glow was approximately . The Company does not expect to deduct any of the acquired goodwill
for tax purposes. 

and respectively. The vast majority of
these revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were derived from a large number of customers. 

Suppliers 

For
the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we purchased products for sale by SWC, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary from several
contract manufacturers located in Asia and the U.S. A substantial portion of the Company s inventory was purchased from two suppliers
which accounted over 10 of the total purchases. The two suppliers accounted for and , respectively, of the Company s
total inventory purchase for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

Segment
reporting information 

A
reconciliation of the Company s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for June 30, 2022 and 2021
is as follows: 

Cannabis products delivery 

Total operating income 

of Indigo s outstanding equity and as of September 30, 2020, involved its day-to-day operations, which gave the
Company the power to direct the activities of Indigo that most significantly impact its economic performance. Accordingly, the Company
recognized the carrying value of the non-controlling interest as a component of total stockholders equity, and the consolidated
financial statements included the financial position and results of operations of Indigo as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2020
and September 30, 2020. 

Starting
on October 1, 2020, the Company planned to open new locations via purchasing equity in other brand/franchises to cover delivery for the
entire California. Therefore, the Company is not likely at this time to exercise its option to acquire the additional interest in
Indigo. In addition, the Company is no longer involved in day-to-day operations of Indigo and going forward, the Company intends to pursue
cannabis delivery independent from Indigo. As of October 1, 2020, the Company ceased to have control over the day-to-day business of
Indigo and it was deconsolidated and recorded as an investment in nonconsolidated affiliate at its estimated fair value and
changed to equity method of accounting. Pursuant to the terms of the Indigo agreement, if the Company determines, in its discretion not
to continue to make monthly payments, its ownership interest in Indigo will be decreased according to the payment then made. As of
December 31, 2020, the Company made in additional payments, and holds approximately of the ownership of Indigo. 

The

with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

Our Chief Executive Officer conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 (COSO 2013 Framework)
and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This
was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected
our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were the
relative inexperience of our management and supporting personnel with the compliance and control requirements of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting
compliance. 

We have taken, and are continuing to take, certain
actions to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We plan to hire additional credentialed professional
staff and consulting professionals with greater knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP and related regulatory requirements to oversee our
financial reporting process in order to ensure our compliance with U.S. GAAP and other relevant securities laws. In addition, we plan
to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on U.S. GAAP, and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of
financial statements. 

Notwithstanding the above identified material weakness,
the Company s management believes that its condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in
all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that
this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements,
in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.

registered public accounting firm to be able to form an opinion on our consolidated financial statements. The board of directors preapproves
specified annual audit services engagement terms and fees and other specified audit fees. All other audit services must be specifically

changes in terms, conditions, and fees resulting from changes in audit scope or other items.

within preapproved fee levels. All other audit-related services must be preapproved by the board of directors.

of directors preapproves specified tax services that it believes would not impair the independence of the independent registered public
accounting firm and that are consistent with the SEC rules and guidance. The board of directors must specifically approve all other tax
