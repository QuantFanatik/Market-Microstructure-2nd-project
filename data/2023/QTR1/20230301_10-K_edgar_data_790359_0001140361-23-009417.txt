 Trust I and Alliance Financial Capital Trust II, which were formed in 2003 and 2006, respectively. The Company guarantees, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust
 preferred securities. The Trusts are variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ). In accordance with ASC, the
 accounts of the Trusts are not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Competition

The financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial products and services in our market
 area. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of the rate environment, changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers and the accelerating pace of consolidation among
 financial services providers. The Company competes for loans, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money
 market funds, credit unions and other nonbank financial service providers.

The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance
 companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. In addition,
 technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.

Some of the Company s nonbanking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of the Company s competitors have assets, capital and lending
 limits greater than that of the Company, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Company. These institutions may have the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may be
 able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than the Company can offer. Some of these institutions offer services, such as credit cards and international banking, which the Company does not directly offer.

Various in-state market competitors and out-of-state banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter or expand their presence in the market areas where the Company currently operates. With
 the addition of new financial services providers within our market, the Company expects increased competition for loans, deposits and other financial products and services.

In order to compete with other financial services providers, the Company stresses the community nature of its banking operations and principally relies upon local promotional activities, personal
 relationships established by officers, directors and employees with the Company s customers and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. We also offer certain customer services, such as agricultural lending, that
 many of our larger competitors do not offer. While the Company s position varies by market, the Company s management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making and awareness of customer
 needs.

Data Privacy and Security Practices

The Company s enterprise security strategy revolves around people, processes and technology. The Company employs a defense in depth strategy, which combines physical control measures with logical
 control measures and uses a layered security model to provide end-to-end security of Company and client information. The high-level objective of the information security program is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all
 information assets in our environment. We accomplish this by building our program around six foundational control areas: program oversight and governance, safeguards and controls, security awareness training, service provider oversight, incident
 response and business continuity. The Company s data security and privacy practices follow all applicable laws and regulations including the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 2001 GLBA and applicable privacy laws described under the heading Supervision
 and Regulation in this Item 1. Business section.

The controls identified in our enterprise security program are managed by various stakeholders throughout the Company and monitored by the information security team. All employees are required to
 complete information security and privacy training when they join the Company and then complete annual online training certification and ad hoc face to face trainings. The Company engages outside consultants to perform periodic audits of our
 information and data security controls and processes including penetration testing of the Company s public facing websites and corporate networks. The Board of Directors requires the Company s Information Security Officer to report to them the
 status of the overall information security and data privacy program on a recurring basis. More information can be located on the Company s website https://www.nbtbank.com/Personal/Customer-Support/Fraud-Information-Center.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion DEI initiatives remains stronger than ever. In 2022 the Company named a full-time Chief Diversity Officer after several years of leaders executing
 the responsibility of this role in a shared capacity. With full-time focus, the Chief Diversity Officer will continue to advance our DEI journey with strategies connected to engagement, careers and recruitment, innovation and measurement.

The Company s DEI strategy has a commitment to enhancing our diversity making us more innovative and effective at meeting the needs of our customers and communities. The Company utilizes a variety of
 approaches to maximize diversity within each pool of candidates through both internal and external recruitment practices. It is the Company s belief that these efforts will provide equitable opportunities and contribute to improved products and
 services, better customer engagement and ultimately enhanced stockholder return.

Both grassroots and executive sponsored strategies continue to be critical to our DEI initiatives. Executive sponsored strategies support leadership opportunities with cross functional/geographic
 teams, panel discussions and a fireside chat in support of women s empowerment and being your authentic self and a financial contribution to a community center supporting LGBTQ youth. Our DEI Inclusion Roundtable supports grassroots efforts
 focusing on raising awareness of various cultural and diverse interests. NBT Communities is an internal social media forum where employees with similar interests across the footprint can connect and get to know each other around a variety of
 topics. In addition, the Inclusion Roundtable launched Coffee and Connections as a way for employees to convene for thirty minutes over coffee in a virtual setting to discuss generational diversity, neurodiversity, travel interests and more.

The Company has a DEI steering committee comprised of members of the executive team, including the Chief Executive Officer. The plan is shared with our Board of Directors, management and employees,
 who are often included in implementing specific action items.

Investment in Our People

The Company s focus on investing in our people includes key initiatives to attract, develop and retain our valued employees. Talent acquisition and more importantly, retention, continue to be top
 priorities especially in the post-pandemic environment and considering the current challenges in the labor market. An Employee Referral Program was implemented in the third quarter resulting in current employees referring 18 of the new employees
 hired in 2022.

While our employee retention rate remains consistently high, significant effort is placed on retaining our valued employees - stay interviews, career planning conversations, an on-going coaching
 process, goal setting, individual development plans and enhanced communications all play a part in employee satisfaction. Our 2022 Employee Engagement survey provided insights leading to specific initiatives to enhance future engagement including
 clarity around business strategies, decision making and development opportunities. Positive feedback relating to high levels of interaction between managers and employees was received.

The Company offers total rewards that address employees at various stages of their personal lives and careers, including a student loan repayment program, financial wellness programs, undergraduate
 and graduate tuition, paid parental leave, more flexibility in work schedules and paid leave benefits and a retirement transition option. The Company s incentive programs recognize employees at all levels and are designed to motivate employees to
 support achievement of company success, with appropriate risk assessment and prevention measures designed to prevent fraud.

Learning and Career Development

The Company s main priority is to attract and retain top talent by encouraging and promoting internal development. We invested in a variety of development tools and resources for all employees,
 including the introduction of LinkedIn Learning Library. The LinkedIn Learning Library is intended to make learning and development accessible to all employees in a concise, easily consumable format that enables employees to get the development
 they need to achieve individual career aspirations. In addition to the library, there are distinct training and development programs strategically designed to attract top talent early in their careers and to further foster the growth and retention
 of our high potential and emerging leaders. These programs have been designed to meet the objectives outlined in our succession plan. Our Management Development Program aims to attract diverse talent, primarily college seniors by offering
 accelerated career advancement and mentoring with senior executives. The Company also offers two programs designed for high potential employees, one for employees with prior professional experience and another one targeted to our more experienced
 employees with direct leadership responsibility. Both programs include a mentor, a coach, 360-degree feedback, individual development plans, presentation skill development and increased visibility to executive leadership. The programs accommodate
 delivery in both remote and in person learning environments, made possible by utilizing our Microsoft Teams technology which was implemented across the Company to strengthen internal communications, collaboration, and talent development. To support
 career development, we employ an internal career manager to work as a liaison with employees and managers. The Company also has a robust annual talent review and succession planning process that includes the Board of Directors and senior
 management.

Engaging Employees

The Company seeks to further refine its culture by soliciting employee opinions using engagement surveys. In addition, the Company regularly uses pulse surveys to explore further the sentiments behind
 employee well-being, attitudes about remote work, productivity, and work-life balance. A full Engagement Survey was completed in September 2022 to assess the overall level of employee engagement. We were pleased at the high level of engagement and
 participation in the survey. Divisional and Corporate actions are being developed to address areas employees suggested would be helpful. The Company believes engaged employees will drive retention, encourage discretionary employee effort, and
 ultimately produce better experiences for our customers.

Conduct and Ethics

The Board of Directors and senior management have vigorously endorsed a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases and unethical behavior. The Company s values-based Code of Business Conduct

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ), U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation
 and oversight. The Trump administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies enacted some legislation and took other steps to modify and scale back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain of its implementing regulations. It is not
 clear at this time what the effect on the Company would be of any legislation or regulatory changes that may be enacted or implemented by the Biden administration, though major changes are not expected in the near term.

Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a bank holding company as defined by the BHC Act. The BHC Act generally limits the business of the Company to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB
 has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Company has also qualified for and elected to be a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain
 the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (2) complementary to a financial
 activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system (as solely determined by the FRB). If a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities
 permitted under the BHC Act for financial holding companies, (1) the bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well-capitalized and well-managed, as defined in the FRB s Regulation Y and (2) it must file a
 declaration with the FRB that it elects to be a financial holding company. In order for a financial holding company to commence any activity that is financial in nature, incidental thereto, or complementary to a financial activity, or to acquire
 a company engaged in any such activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the
 Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA ). See the section titled Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 for further information relating to the CRA.

Regulation of Mergers and Acquisitions

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of depository institutions and their holding companies. The BHC Act requires prior FRB approval for a bank
 holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25 or more of any class of voting
 securities of a bank or bank holding company (and sometimes a lower percentage if there are other indications of control). Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a
 bank without providing 60 days prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency.

Under the Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the OCC is required for a national bank to merge with another bank where the national bank is the surviving bank or to purchase the assets or assume the
 deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other criteria, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the
 capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant s performance record under the CRA and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.

As a financial holding company, the Company is permitted to acquire control of non-depository institutions engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are incidental to
 financial activities without prior FRB approval. However, the BHC Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires prior written approval from the FRB or prior written notice to the FRB before a financial holding company may acquire control of a
 company with consolidated assets of 10 billion or more.

Capital Distributions

The principal source of the Company s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. The OCC oversees the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions, including dividends. The OCC generally prohibits a
 depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. The OCC s prior approval is required if the
 total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank s net income for that year and its undistributed net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. The
 National Bank Act also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank s allowance for loan losses.

The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking
 organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, based on the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank, that the payment of
 dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment.

Affiliate and Insider Transactions

Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the Company, are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA and the FRB s implementing Regulation W. An
 affiliate of a bank includes any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank and companies that are controlled
 by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses in transactions with affiliates. These sections place quantitative and
 qualitative limitations on covered transactions between the Bank and its affiliates and require that all transactions between a bank and its affiliates occur on market terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to the Bank s and its affiliates directors, executive officers and principal stockholders Insiders ). Under Section 22(h),
 loans to Insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the Bank s loan-to-one borrower limit. Loans to Insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior
 approval of the Bank s Board of Directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other
 persons, except that such Insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the Bank s employees and does not give preference to the Insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA
 places additional limitations on loans to the Bank s and its affiliates executive officers.

Federal Deposit Insurance and Brokered Deposits

The FDIC s deposit insurance limit is 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category, in accordance with applicable FDIC regulations. The Bank s deposit accounts are
 fully insured by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF up to the deposit insurance limits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating CAMELS rating ). The risk
 matrix uses different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for deposit insurance assessments is the consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment
 rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed.

Under FDIC laws and regulations, no FDIC-insured depository institution can accept brokered deposits unless it is well-capitalized or unless it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the
 FDIC. Applicable laws and regulations also limits the interest rate that any depository institution that is not well-capitalized may pay on brokered deposits.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA ), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound
 condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank s management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of its
 deposit insurance.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of New York, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The
 Bank is subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the requirement to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.125 of mortgage related assets at the beginning of each year.
 The Bank was in compliance with FHLB rules and requirements as of December 31, 2022.

Debit Card Interchange Fees

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. FRB regulations
 mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act limit interchange fees on debit cards to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. The rule also permits a fraud-prevention adjustment of 1 cent per transaction conditioned
 upon an issuer developing, implementing and updating reasonably designed fraud-prevention policies and procedures. Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have less than 10 billion of assets, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee
 standards. In addition, FRB regulations prohibit all issuers, including the Company and the Bank, from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.

In December 2020, the OCC, together with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC, issued an interim final rule to temporarily mitigate transition costs related to the
 COVID-19 pandemic on community banking organizations with less than 10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019. The rule allowed organizations, including the Company, to use assets as of December 31, 2019, to determine the applicability of
 various regulatory asset thresholds. During 2020, the Company crossed the 10 billion threshold but elected to delay the regulatory implications of crossing the 10 billion threshold until 2022 for these debit card interchange fee standards. The
 Company became subject to the new standards starting in July 2022.

Source of Strength Doctrine

FRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codifies the requirement that bank
 holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. A bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by
 the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of FRB regulations or both. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to
 provide such resources. Any capital loan by the Company to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides that, in the event of a bank holding
 company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

In addition, under the National Bank Act, if the Bank s capital stock is impaired by losses or otherwise, the OCC is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the Company. If
 the assessment is not paid within three months, the OCC could order a sale of Bank stock held by the Company to cover any deficiency.

The CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide national emergency economic relief measures.
 Many of the CARES Act s programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, and have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including
 the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and the Bank. Furthermore, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory
 authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation, lifecycle, and eligibility requirements for the various CARES Act programs as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for the COVID-19 pandemic. In
 addition, it is possible that Congress will enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act and
 other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, as extended by certain provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, also initially permitted banks to suspend requirements under
 generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that would otherwise have been characterized as troubled debt restructurings and suspended any determination
 related thereto if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications were related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurred between March 1, 2020 and January 1, 2022. Federal bank regulatory
 authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19.

Paycheck Protection Program

Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), a program that was administered by the Small Business Administration SBA to provide loans to small businesses for
 payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. The Company participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by
 the SBA. Additionally, loan payments are deferred for the first six months of the loan term. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. As a participating
 lender in the PPP, the Bank continues to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto.

Temporary Regulatory Capital Relief Related to Impact of CECL

Concurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, in March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on
 regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of Accounting Standards Updates 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments CECL ).

The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology s effect on
 regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.

Capital Adequacy

In July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the Capital Rules that established a new capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement
 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s (the Basel Committee December 2010 final capital framework referred to as Basel III for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of
 regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions 
 regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach.

11 

Table of Contents 

The Capital Rules: (1) require a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (2) specify that Tier 1 capital consists
 of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (3) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (4) expand the
 scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including the Company, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative
 perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules specific requirements.

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are:

4.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets;

6.0 Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;

8.0 Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and

4.0 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio ).

The Capital Rules also require a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb
 losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument
 repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally until when, on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in, resulting in the capital standards
 applicable to the Company and the Bank including an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of CET1, and effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 ,
 (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 and (3) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 . The risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories,
 depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. The Capital Rules provide for a
 number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1.

In addition, under the prior general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss AOCI items included in stockholders equity (for example,
 marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale AFS portfolio) under GAAP were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded;
 however, banking organizations not using the advanced approaches, including the Company and the Bank, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in January 2015. The Capital Rules also preclude certain
 hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from inclusion in bank holding companies Tier 1 capital.

Management believes that the Company is in compliance with the targeted capital ratios.

Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness

Pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action PCA should an insured depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy
 standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or
 prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration
 plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, may be
 treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such
 treatment.

For purposes of PCA, to be: (1) well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8 , a CET1
 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 ; (2) adequately capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at
 least 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 ; (3) undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital
 ratio of less than 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4 ; (4) significantly undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than
 6 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than 3 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3 .; (5) critically undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a ratio of tangible
 equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2 . At December 31, 2022, the Bank qualified as well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital standards.

Bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound
 practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of
 directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders
 against officers, directors and other institution affiliated parties; the termination of the insured depository institution s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the insured depository institution; and the
 enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the FDIC, as receiver, would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

Volcker Rule

Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities from: (1) engaging in proprietary trading and (2) investing in or sponsoring certain
 covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA ), depository institutions and their holding companies with less than 10 billion in assets, are excluded from
 the prohibitions of the Volcker Rule. During 2020, the Company crossed the 10 billion threshold, accordingly, we are subject to the Volcker Rule again. Given the Company s size and the scope of its activities, the implementation of the Volcker
 Rule did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Depositor Preference

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as
 subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and
 uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository
 institution.

Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing and examining
 compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The Company grew its asset base in excess of 10 billion in 2020. The Company is now subject to the CFPB s examination authority with regard to compliance with federal consumer financial laws and
 regulations, in addition to the OCC as the primary regulatory of the Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general are empowered to enforce rules issued by the CFPB.

The Company is subject to federal consumer financial statutes and the regulations promulgated thereunder including, but not limited to:

the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA ), prohibiting discrimination in connection with the extension of credit;

the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA ), requiring home mortgage lenders, including the Bank, to make available to the public expanded information regarding the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the
 rate spread between the annual percentage rate and the average prime offer rate for mortgage loans of a comparable type;

the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA ), governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and

the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.

The Bank s failure to comply with any of the consumer financial laws can result in civil actions, regulatory enforcement action by the federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice.

USA PATRIOT Act

The Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 USA PATRIOT Act ), imposes
 obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of
 terrorism. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an
 exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the GLBA and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign
 individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns and are prohibited from dealing with foreign shell banks and
 persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. Since May 11, 2018, the Bank has been required to comply
 with the Customer Due Diligence Rule, which clarified and strengthened the existing obligations for identifying new and existing customers and explicitly included risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. All financial
 institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial
 institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Company has a BSA and USA PATRIOT Act board-approved compliance program commensurate with its risk profile.

Identity Theft Prevention

The FCRA s Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g., consumer bank accounts and loans) to develop, implement and administer an identity theft prevention program. This
 program must include reasonable policies and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such as inconsistencies in personal information or changes in account activity.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The United States government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the OFAC rules based on
 their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (1)
 restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to
 making investments in or providing investment-related advice or assistance to a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting
 transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license
 from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Financial Privacy and Data Security

The Company and the Bank are subject to federal laws, including the GLBA and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other
 financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from nonaffiliated financial institutions. These provisions require
 notice of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations.

The GLBA requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer
 information. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the GLBA and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. The
 Bank follows all GLBA obligations.

The Bank is also subject to data security standards, privacy and data breach notice requirements, primarily those issued by the OCC. The federal banking agencies, through the Federal Financial
 Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cyber security risks and identify, assess and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third party services providers.

Community Reinvestment Act of 1977

The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA
 does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community,
 consistent with the CRA. Regulators periodically assess the Bank s record of compliance with the CRA. The Bank s failure to comply with the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the
 Company. The Bank s most current CRA rating was Satisfactory. 

Future Legislative Initiatives

Congress, state legislatures and financial regulatory agencies may introduce various legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect the financial services industry, generally. Such
 initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and/or depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking
 statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive
 balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on
 the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.

Employees

At December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,861 full-time equivalent employees. The Company s employees are not presently represented by any collective bargaining group.

ITEM 1A. 

RISK FACTORS 

There are risks inherent to the Company s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Any of the following risks could affect the
 Company s financial condition and results of operations and could be material and/or adverse in nature. You should consider all of the following risks together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risks Related to our Business and Industry

The Company may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

The economy in the United States and globally has experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There
 can be no assurance that economic conditions will not worsen. Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or
 increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, the timing and impact of changing governmental policies, natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (including COVID-19), terrorist attacks, acts of war or a
 combination of these or other factors. A worsening of business and economic conditions could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:

investors may have less confidence in the equity markets in general and in financial services industry stocks in particular, which could place downward pressure on the Company s stock price and resulting market
 valuation;

consumer and business confidence levels could be lowered and cause declines in credit usage and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates;

the Company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches the Company uses to select, manage and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future
 behaviors;

the Company could suffer decreases in demand for loans or other financial products and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with the Company;

demand for and income received from the Company s fee-based services could decline;

customers of the Company s trust and benefit plan administration business may liquidate investments, which together with lower asset values, may reduce the level of assets under management and administration and
 thereby decrease the Company s investment management and administration revenues;

competition in the financial services industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions or otherwise; and

the value of loans and other assets or collateral securing loans may decrease.

As economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved, the Federal Reserve has shifted its focus to limiting inflationary and other potentially adverse effects of the extensive
 pandemic-related government stimulus, which signals the potential for a continued period of economic uncertainty even though the pandemic has subsided. In addition, there are continuing concerns related to, among other things, the level of U.S.
 government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt, a potential resurgence of economic and political tensions with China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all of which may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets
 and economic activity. Economic pressure on consumers and overall economic uncertainty may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits. These economic conditions and/or other negative developments in the
 domestic or international credit markets or economies may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and
 sales volumes and high unemployment or underemployment may also result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative
 events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.

Deterioration in local economic conditions may negatively impact our financial performance.

The Company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in central and upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont, southern
 Maine, central Connecticut and the specific local markets in which the Company operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers
 primarily in the upstate New York areas of Norwich, Syracuse, Oneonta, Amsterdam-Gloversville, Albany, Binghamton, Utica-Rome, Plattsburgh, Glens Falls and Ogdensburg-Massena, the northeastern Pennsylvania areas of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre,
 Berkshire County, Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire, Vermont, southern Maine and central Connecticut. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company s products and services as well as the
 ability of the Company s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company s deposit funding sources.

16 

Table of Contents 

A downturn in our local economies could cause significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could negatively impact our earnings. Declines in real estate values in our market areas could cause
 any of our loans to become inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to greater risk of loss. Additionally, a decline in real estate values could result in the decline of originations of such loans, as most of our loans and the collateral
 securing our loans are located in those areas.

Severe weather, flooding and other effects of climate change and other natural disasters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or
 liquidity.

Our branch locations and our customers properties may be adversely impacted by flooding, wildfires, high winds and other effects of severe weather conditions that may be caused or exacerbated by
 climate change. These events can force property closures, result in property damage and/or result in delays in expansion, development or renovation of our properties and those of our customers. Even if these events do not directly impact our
 properties or our customers properties, they may impact us and our customers through increased insurance, energy or other costs. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, including federal, state or city laws, relating to climate change could
 result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our branch locations and/or our customers properties.

Variations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The Company s earnings and financial condition, like that of most financial institutions, are largely dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and
 investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect the Company s earnings and financial condition. The Company cannot predict with certainty, or control, changes in interest
 rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect rates and, therefore, interest income and interest expense. In order to address rising inflation, the FRB
 raised interest rates in 2022 and may continue to do so; however, the magnitude of any such further increase is not currently known. High interest rates could also affect the amount of loans that the Company can originate because higher rates could
 cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages or cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost. The Company may also experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing on both
 deposits and loans. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect
 net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If the Company is not able to reduce its funding costs sufficiently, due to either
 competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then the Company s net interest margin will decline.

Any substantial or unexpected change in, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. See the
 section captioned Net Interest Income in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk located elsewhere in this report for
 further discussion related to the Company s management of interest rate risk.

Our lending, and particularly our emphasis on commercial lending, exposes us to the risk of losses upon borrower default.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 50 of the Company s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, agricultural, commercial construction and commercial real estate loans. These types
 of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers and, for
 construction loans, the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers
 compared to residential real estate loans. Because the Company s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, agricultural, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the
 deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and/or
 an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned Loans in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
 Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our commercial and industrial, agricultural, construction and commercial real estate loans.

Our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
 and results of operations.

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is an allowance established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management s best estimate of expected
 credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the
 allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks, forecast economic conditions and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.
 Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Company s control, may require an increase in the allowance
 for loan losses. Bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from
 those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. These potential increases in the allowance for loan
 losses would result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned Risk Management Credit Risk in Item 7.
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.
 Management expects that the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses from quarter to quarter as changes in the level of allowance for loan losses will be dependent upon, among other things, macroeconomic
 forecasts and conditions, loan portfolio volumes and credit quality.

Strong competition within our industry and market area could adversely affect our performance and slow our growth.

The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
 primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which the Company operates. Additionally, various banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which the Company currently
 operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial
 intermediaries. The financial services industry could continue to become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it
 possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Company s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.
 Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company can.

The Company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:

the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;

the ability to expand the Company s market position;

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;

the rate at which the Company introduces new products, services and technologies relative to its competitors;

customer satisfaction with the Company s level of service;

industry and general economic trends; and

the ability to attract and retain talented employees.

Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Company s competitive position, which could adversely affect the Company s growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have
 a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect net interest income and earnings.

The purpose of the Company s liquidity management is to meet the cash flow obligations of its customers for both deposits and loans. The primary liquidity measurement the Company utilizes is called
 basic surplus, which captures the adequacy of the Company s access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding mix of average liabilities. This approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity
 from short and long-term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources, which can be accessed when necessary. However, competitive pressure on deposit pricing could result in a decrease in the Company s deposit base or an
 increase in funding costs. In addition, liquidity will come under additional pressure if loan growth exceeds deposit growth. These scenarios could lead to a decrease in the Company s basic surplus measure to an amount below the minimum policy level
 of 5 . To manage this risk, the Company has the ability to purchase brokered time deposits, borrow against established borrowing facilities with other banks (Federal funds) and enter into repurchase agreements with investment companies. Depending
 on the level of interest rates applicable to these alternatives, the Company s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. See the section captioned Liquidity Risk in Item 7.

Our ability to service our debt, pay dividends and otherwise pay our obligations as they come due is substantially dependent on capital distributions from our
 subsidiaries.

The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source
 of funds to pay dividends on the Company s common stock and interest and principal on the Company s debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In addition, the
 Company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company
 may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company s common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of
 operations.

A reduction in the Company s credit rating could adversely affect our business and/or the holders of our securities.

The credit rating agency rating our indebtedness regularly evaluates the Company and the Bank. Credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate
 earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain our
 current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of the Company or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, significantly increase our cost of funds, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties
 willing to lend to the Company or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.

The Company relies on third parties to provide key components of its business infrastructure.

The Company relies on third parties to provide key components for its business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and
 services, internet connections and network access. While the Company selects these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other
 disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of
 services by a vendor, could adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company s
 operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors also could create significant delays and expense that adversely affect the Company s business and performance.

There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing
 lines of business.

From time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with
 these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for
 the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive
 alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact
 on the effectiveness of the Company s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the
 Company s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Changes

We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our
 financial results.

We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, the DIF and the safety and soundness of the banking
 system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Company s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review
 banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in
 substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or limit the pricing the Company may charge on certain banking services,
 among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.

Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned Supervision
 and Regulation in Item 1. Business of this report for further information.

We are subject to heightened regulatory requirements because we now exceed 10 billion in total consolidated assets.

As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of approximately 11.74 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act, including the Durbin Amendment, and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory
 requirements on bank holding companies with more than 10 billion in total consolidated assets. For bank holding companies with more than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, such requirements include, among other things:

applicability of Volcker Rule requirements and restrictions;

increased capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management standards;

examinations by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations; and

limits on interchange fees from debit cards transactions.

The EGRRCPA, which was enacted in 2018, amended the Dodd-Frank Act to raise the 10 billion stress testing threshold to 250 billion, among other things. The federal financial regulators issued final
 rules in 2019 to increase the threshold for these stress testing requirements from 10 billion to 250 billion, consistent with the EGRRCPA.

We expect that our regulators will consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements that now apply to us (in addition to regulatory requirements that applied to us previously) when examining
 our operations or considering any request for regulatory approval. We may, therefore, incur associated compliance costs and may be required to maintain compliance procedures.

Failure to comply with these new requirements may negatively impact the results of our operations and financial condition. To ensure compliance, we will be required to invest significant resources,
 which may necessitate hiring additional personnel and implementing additional internal controls. These additional compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or
 compelling banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The U.S. bank regulators issued a Statement on LIBOR Transition on November 30, 2020 and subsequent guidance encouraging banks to transition away from U.S. Dollar (USD) LIBOR by December 31, 2021 at
 the latest for new contracts. LIBOR is currently anticipated to be fully phased out by June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR is the rate that
 represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently
 working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. The Company is in the process of transitioning legacy LIBOR loans to SOFR by June 30, 2023.

We have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from
 LIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR, could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to
 us, could create considerable costs and additional risk and could have an adverse impact on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing
 new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage
 this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.

Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and
 operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations
 related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be held responsible for environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title, resulting in significant financial loss.

A significant portion of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to
 environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with
 environmental contamination or may be required to clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner
 or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect our
 business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions including the FHLB of New York.

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated
 as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers
 and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry
 generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our
 credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not
 materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The Company owns common stock of FHLB of New York in order to qualify for membership in the FHLB system, which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB of New York s advance program. The carrying
 value and fair market value of our FHLB of New York common stock was 26.8 million as of December 31, 2022. There are 11 branches of the FHLB, including New York, which are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the
 extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system s debt, other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment. Any adverse effects on the FHLB of New York could adversely affect the value of our
 investment in its common stock and negatively impact our results of operations.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain banking laws, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third
 party.

Provisions of the Company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could
 delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, despite the possible benefit to the Company s stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Company s common stock. These provisions include supermajority
 voting requirements for certain business combinations and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company s Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the
 Company is subject to Delaware law, which among other things prohibits the Company from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless
 certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company s common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the
 holders of the Company s common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than candidates nominated by the Board.

The Company has risk related to legal proceedings.

The Company is involved in judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from our business activities and fiduciary responsibilities. The Company establishes reserves
 for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if a reserve is not established. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal
 claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending or future legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations
 and financial condition.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

The Company faces operational risks and cybersecurity risks associated with incidents which have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause material harm to
 our financial condition, result in misappropriation of assets, compromise confidential information and/or damage our business relationships and cannot guarantee that the steps we and our service providers take in response to these risks will be
 effective.

We depend upon data processing, communication systems, and information exchange on a variety of platforms and networks and over the internet to conduct business operations. In addition, we rely on the
 services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Although we require third party providers to maintain certain levels of security, such providers remain vulnerable to breaches, security incidents, system
 unavailability or other malicious attacks that could compromise sensitive information. The risk of experiencing security incidents and disruptions, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions has generally increased as the number,
 intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions by organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties has increased. These security incidents may result in disruption of our operations;
 material harm to our financial condition, cash flows and the market price of our common stock; misappropriation of assets; compromise or corruption of confidential information; liability for information or assets stolen during the incident;
 remediation costs; increased cybersecurity and insurance costs; regulatory enforcement; litigation; and damage to our stakeholder and customer relationships.

Moreover, in the normal course of business, we and our service providers collect and retain certain personal information provided by our customers, employees and vendors. If this information gets
 mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost or stolen, we could suffer significant financial, business, reputational, regulatory or other harm. These risks may increase as we continue to increase and expand our usage of web-based products and
 applications.

These risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify potential cybersecurity risks, and upgrade and expand our
 technologies, systems and processes to adequately address the risk. We provide on-going training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other malicious schemes. Such attention diverts time and resources from other
 activities and, while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to maintain the security and integrity of the information we and our service providers collect on our and their computer systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts
 will be effective. Likewise, while we have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal information and prevent or limit the effect of possible incidents, we can provide no assurance that a security breach or disruption
 will not be successful or damaging, or, if any such breach or disruption does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.

Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not
 recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other
 preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.

The Company may be adversely affected by fraud.

As a financial institution, the Company is inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers and other third parties targeting the
 Company and/or the Company s customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to
 maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.

We continually encounter technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could have a material adverse impact on our business.

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology
 increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to serve customers better and to reduce costs. The Company s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and
 services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company s operations. Many of the Company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may
 not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial
 services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company s business and, in turn, the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to an Investment in the Company s Securities

There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company s equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company s stock.

The Company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The
 Company also grants shares of common stock to employees and directors under the Company s incentive plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of the Company s common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable
 for or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of the Company s common stock. Holders of the Company s common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle
 such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. Because the Company s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions, its acquisition activity and other factors,
 the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings. Thus, the Company s stockholders bear the risk of the Company s future offerings reducing the market price of the Company s common stock and diluting their
 stock holdings in the Company.

Risks Related to the Merger

The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, that may delay the merger or
 adversely impact the Company s and Salisbury s ability to complete the merger.

The completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Before the merger may be completed, various approvals, waivers and/or consents must be obtained from
 state and federal governmental authorities, including the FRB, the OCC and the Connecticut Department of Banking CTDOB ). Satisfying the requirements of these governmental authorities may delay the date of completion of the merger. In addition,
 these governmental authorities may include conditions on the completion of the merger, or require changes to the terms of the merger. While it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed promptly following the receipt of all required
 regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that no effect, event, development or change will transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being
 satisfied or impose additional costs on or limit the revenues of the Company following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on the Company following the merger. The parties are not obligated to complete the merger should
 any regulatory approval contain a condition, restriction or requirement that our Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith would, individually or in the aggregate, materially reduce the benefits of the merger to such a degree that the
 Company would not have entered into the merger agreement had such condition, restriction or requirement been known at the date of the merger agreement.

The Company and Salisbury cannot provide any assurances with respect to the timing of the closing of the merger, whether the merger will be completed at all or when Salisbury stockholders would
 receive the consideration for the merger, if at all.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price of the Company and its future business and financial results.

Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including approval by Salisbury stockholders of the merger. The Company cannot guarantee when or if these
 conditions will be satisfied or that the merger will be successfully completed. The consummation of the merger may be delayed, the merger may be consummated on terms different than those contemplated by the merger agreement, or the merger may not
 be consummated at all. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected, and the Company and will be subject to several risks, including the following:

the Company could incur substantial costs relating to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees; and

the Company s management s and employees attention may be diverted from their day-to-day business and operational matters as a result of efforts relating to attempting to consummate the merger.

In addition, if the merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and the Company may experience negative reactions from its customers and
 employees. The Company also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against the Company to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not
 completed, the Company and Salisbury cannot assure their respective stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business and financial results of the Company or the stock price of the Company.

The integration of the Company and Salisbury will present significant challenges that may result in the combined business not operating as effectively as
 expected or in the failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

The benefits and synergies expected to result from the proposed transaction will depend in part on whether the operations of Salisbury can be integrated in a timely and efficient manner with those of
 the Company. The Company will face challenges in consolidating its functions with those of Salisbury, and integrating the organizations, procedures and operations of the two businesses. The integration of the Company and Salisbury will be complex
 and time-consuming, and the management of both companies will have to dedicate substantial time and resources to it. These efforts could divert management s focus and resources from serving existing customers or other strategic opportunities and
 from day-to-day operational matters during the integration process. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of the Company and Salisbury could result in the failure to achieve some of the anticipated benefits from the transaction,
 including cost savings and other operating efficiencies, and the Company may not be able to capitalize on the existing relationships of Salisbury to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected to
 achieve these goals. This could have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company and/or the Bank after the transaction.

Unanticipated costs relating to the merger could reduce our future earnings per share.

The Company has incurred substantial legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs, and management has devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the merger. If the merger is not
 completed, the Company will bear certain fees and expenses associated with the merger without realizing the benefits of the merger. If the merger is completed, the Company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the
 business, operations, network, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the two companies. The fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on the Company s results of operations.

The Company believes that it has reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating the operations of the Company and Salisbury, and the incremental costs of operating as a combined company.
 However, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as increased personnel costs or increased taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse
 developments, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. If unexpected costs are incurred, the merger could have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share. In other
 words, if the merger is completed, the earnings per share of our common stock could be less than anticipated or even less than if the merger had not been completed.

Following the merger, the Company may not continue to pay dividends at or above the rate currently paid.

Following the merger, our stockholders may not receive dividends at the same rate that they did as stockholders of the Company prior to the merger for various reasons, including the following:

we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in its cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;

decisions on whether, when and in what amounts to make any future dividends will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend practices
 at any time and for any reason; and

the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these
 subsidiaries may incur.

Our stockholders will have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared by our Board of Directors.

General Risks

The risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The business strategy of the Company has included and may continue to include growth through acquisition. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions.
 These risks may include, among other things:

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired business;

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired business;

our ability to realize anticipated cost savings;

the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel and the potential loss of key employees;

the potential disruption of our or the acquired company s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues or the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position;

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and

the impairment of relationships with the acquired company s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.

We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have
 an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy and results of operations.

We rely on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.

We are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our executive management team. In addition, we will continue to depend on our ability to retain and recruit key client relationship
 managers. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Market Information

The common stock of the Company, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NBTB. The closing price of the Common Stock on February
 3, 2023 was 41.34. As of February 3, 2023, there were 5,114 stockholders of record of Common Stock. No unregistered securities were sold by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Stock Performance Graph

The following stock performance graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return (i.e., price change, reinvestment of cash dividends and stock dividends received) on our Common Stock against the
 cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S. Companies) Index and the KBW Regional Bank Index (Peer Group). The stock performance graph assumes that 100 was invested on December 31, 2017. The graph further assumes the reinvestment of
 dividends into additional shares of the same class of equity securities at the frequency with which dividends are paid on such securities during the relevant fiscal year. The yearly points marked on the horizontal axis correspond to December 31 of
 that year. We calculate each of the referenced indices in the same manner. All are market-capitalization-weighted indices, so companies judged by the market to be more important (i.e., more valuable) count for more in all indices.

Dividends

The Company depends primarily upon dividends from subsidiaries for a substantial part of the Company s revenue. Accordingly, the ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily upon the
 receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the subsidiaries. Payment of dividends to the Company from the Bank is subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. Under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends to the Company without prior regulatory approval so long as it meets its applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after payment of such dividends and its total dividends do not exceed its net
 income to date over the calendar year plus retained net income over the preceding two years. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable minimum capital requirements and had the ability to pay dividends of 145.3 million to
 the Company without the prior approval of the OCC.

If the capital of the Company is diminished by depreciation in the value of its property or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the
 issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets, no dividends may be paid out of net profits until the deficiency in the amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all
 classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets has been repaired. See the section captioned Supervision and Regulation in Item 1. Business and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
 and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report.

Stock Repurchase

The Company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock during year ended December 31, 2022 at an average price of 36.78 per share under its previously announced share repurchase program. As of
 December 31, 2022, there were 1,600,000 shares available for repurchase under this plan authorized on December 20, 2021 and set to expire on December 31, 2023. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter
 of 2022.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to provide a concise description of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of NBT Bancorp Inc. NBT and its wholly-owned
 subsidiaries, including NBT Bank, National Association (the Bank ), NBT Financial Services, Inc. NBT Financial and NBT Holdings, Inc. NBT Holdings (collectively referred to herein as the Company ). This discussion will focus on results of
 operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, including capital resources and asset/liability management. This discussion and analysis should be read in
 conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this filing and future filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), in the Company s press releases or other public or stockholder communications
 or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, contain forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of phrases such
 as anticipate, believe, expect, forecasts, projects, will, can, would, should, could, may, or other similar terms. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control that could cause actual results
 to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. The discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors, lists some of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any
 forward-looking statements, and such discussion is incorporated into this discussion by reference.

The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and advises readers that various factors, including, but not limited
 to, those described above and other factors discussed in the Company s annual and quarterly reports previously filed with the SEC, could affect the Company s financial performance and could cause the Company s actual results or circumstances for
 future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.

Unless required by law, the Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligations to, publicly release any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect the
 occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

General

NBT Bancorp Inc. is a financial holding company headquartered in Norwich, NY, with total assets of 11.74 billion at December 31, 2022. The Company s business, primarily conducted through the Bank and
 its full-service retirement plan administration and recordkeeping subsidiary and full-service insurance agency subsidiary, consists of providing commercial banking, retail banking, wealth management and other financial services primarily to
 customers in its market area, which includes central and upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont, southern Maine and central Connecticut. The Company s business philosophy is to operate as
 a community bank with local decision-making, providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail, commercial and municipal customers. The financial review that follows focuses on the factors affecting the consolidated financial
 condition and results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank, NBT Financial and NBT Holdings during 2022 and, in summary form, the preceding two years. Net interest margin is presented in this discussion on a fully
 taxable equivalent FTE basis. Average balances discussed are daily averages unless otherwise described. The audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the years in the three-year
 period ended December 31, 2022 should be read in conjunction with this review.

Critical Accounting Estimates

SEC guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting estimates. The SEC defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. The Company follows financial accounting and reporting
 policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Refer to
 Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting standards. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The allowance for credit losses and the
 allowance for unfunded commitments policies noted below are deemed to meet the SEC s definition of a critical accounting estimate.

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments. As a result of the Company s January 1, 2020, adoption of Accounting
 Standards Updates ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments CECL and its related amendments, our methodology for
 estimating the reserve for credit losses changed significantly from December 31, 2019. The standard replaced the incurred loss approach with an expected loss approach known as current expected credit loss. The CECL approach requires an estimate
 of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It removes the incurred loss approach s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The estimate of
 expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is
 generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did
 not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our
 consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted by an expense for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments
 represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
 The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws.

Table of Contents 

Management of the Company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the
 allowance required to cover management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the
 effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.
 While management s current evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions. Going forward, the impact of utilizing
 the CECL approach to calculate the reserve for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material
 changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the reserve for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Company s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate expected credit losses over the forecast
 period. As of December 31, 2022, the model incorporated a baseline economic outlook along with an alternative downside scenario. The baseline outlook reflected an unemployment rate environment initially at 3.9 that increases slightly during the
 forecast period to 4.0 . Northeast GDP s annualized growth (on a quarterly basis) is expected to start the first quarter of 2023 at approximately 3.9 and hovering around 4.6 by the end of the forecast period. The alternative downside scenario
 assumed northeast unemployment rises from 3.9 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to a peak of 6.9 in the first quarter of 2024. These scenarios and their respective weightings are evaluated at each measurement date and reflect management s
 expectations as of December 31, 2022. All else held equal, the changes in the weightings of our forecasted scenarios would impact the amount of estimated allowance for credit losses through changes in the quantitative reserve and scenario-specific
 qualitative adjustments. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses estimate to macroeconomic forecast weightings assumptions as of December 31, 2022, the Company increased the downside scenario weighting by 10 to 60 and
 decreased the baseline scenario to 40 weighting which resulted in a 3 increase in the overall estimated allowance for credit losses. To further demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses estimate to macroeconomic forecast
 weightings assumptions as of December 31, 2022, the Company increased the downside scenario to 100 which resulted in a 16 increase in the overall estimated allowance for credit losses.

Net interest income in 2022 improved in comparison to 2021, primarily due to higher yields on earning assets due to increases in the Federal Reserve s targeted Federal Funds rate combined with growth in
 earning assets, strongly overcoming a 17.6 million 0.31 per diluted share) year-over-year decrease in income from the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). 

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of 17.1 million 0.31 per diluted share) in 2022, compared to a net benefit of 8.3 million 0.15 per diluted share) in 2021.

Card services income was lower than 2021 driven by the impact from the Company being subject to the statutory price cap provisions of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act Durbin Amendment of
 approximately 8 million 0.14 per diluted share).

2023 Outlook

The Company s 2022 earnings reflected a continued ability to invest in the Company s future while managing through persistent volatility in the interest rate environment and overall economic
 conditions which have challenged the financial services industry. Throughout 2022, the Company, along with other financial services companies, experienced lingering disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, the volatility associated with
 the rapid downward shift in the yield curve which remained fairly flat for the majority of 2021 and into early 2022, followed by the drastic rise in rates beginning in the second quarter of 2022, which resulted in an inverted yield curve for much
 of the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. This rate increase was highly correlated with a significant tightening of monetary policy to combat heightened inflation.

Mixed economic indicators, persistent inflation and material inversion of the yield curve have increased the potential for a recession in 2023. While recession probabilities have increased,
 excellent consumer and corporate balance sheets strengthened by government stimulus throughout the COVID-19 pandemic support a view that any form of recession could be mild. Significant items that may have an impact on 2023 results include:

Excess liquidity in the banking system has significantly decreased:

loan growth may be negatively impacted as interest rates have risen and lenders have begun to revert back to historical credit spreads to account for overall higher cost of funds;

cost of deposits as well as overall cost of funds could negatively impact net interest margin. Excess liquidity allowed financial institutions to significantly lag deposit rates in 2022. This lag has increased the potential for a rapid
 increase in deposit rates during 2023 relative to federal funds rate increases;

higher interest rates have afforded deposit customers investment opportunities outside the banking system resulting in deposit declines across the industry. Investment purchases have slowed as runoff investment cash flows have been
 utilized as a source of funding.

Inflationary pressures have taken a hold of the economy as drivers of inflation, initially considered to be transitory in nature, have proven to be more persistent:

this spike to inflation has had a significant impact on current and expected Federal Reserve Monetary Policy;

the tightening of monetary policy through measures to raise interest rates has thus far had a benefit given the Company s asset sensitive balance sheet position. However, elevated deposit costs and the slowing of the economy could
 arise as a result of the higher interest rates.

The Company s continued focus on long-term strategies including growth in the New England markets, diversification of revenue, improving operating efficiencies and investing in technology.

The Company s merger with Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. Salisbury is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the stockholders of Salisbury and
 required regulatory approvals.

The Company s 2023 outlook is subject to factors in addition to those identified above and those risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company s future results are explained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Asset/Liability Management

The Company attempts to maximize net interest income and net income, while actively managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through the mix of various core deposit products and other
 sources of funds, which in turn fund an appropriate mix of earning assets. The changes in the Company s asset mix and sources of funds, and the resulting impact on net interest income, on an FTE basis, are discussed below. The following table
 includes the condensed consolidated average balance sheet, an analysis of interest income/expense and average yield/rate for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a taxable equivalent basis. Interest income for
 tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21 for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 362.2 million, up 41.1 million, or 12.8 , from 2021. PPP loan interest and fees recognized into interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022
 was 3.7 million compared to 21.3 million in 2021. FTE net interest margin was 3.34 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 31 basis points bps from 2021. Interest income increased 44.2
 million, or 13.0 , as the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 33 bps from 2021 to 3.54 , while average interest-earning assets of 10.90 billion increased 267.0 million primarily due to an increase in average loans and investment
 securities. Interest expense was up 3.1 million, or 16.5 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 4 bps to 0.33 , driven by the Company shifting
 from an excess liquidity position to an overnight borrowing position. The Federal Reserve raised its target fed funds rate to 425 basis points in 2022, positively impacting our yields on earning assets.

Loans and Corresponding Interest and Fees on Loans

The average balance of loans increased by approximately 229.8 million, or 3.0 , from 2021 to 2022 with the increases in specialty lending, commercial and industrial C I ), commercial real
 estate CRE ), indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios being partly offset by a reduction in the average balance of PPP and other consumer loans. The yield on average loans increased from 4.01 in 2021 to 4.28 in 2022, as loans
 re-priced upward due to the interest rate environment in 2022. FTE interest income from loans increased 10.1 , from 302.3 million in 2021 to 333.0 million in 2022. This increase was due to the increases in yields and an increase in the average
 balance. Net interest income included interest and fees on PPP loans of 3.7 million and 21.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Total loans were 8.15 billion and 7.50 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total PPP loans as of December 31, 2022 were 0.1 million (net of unamortized fees) with 101.5 million
 of loans forgiven. Excluding PPP loans, period end loans increased 752.0 million or 10.2 from December 31, 2021. Commercial and industrial loans increased 109.8 million to 1.27 billion; commercial real estate loans increased 152.6 million to
 2.81 billion; and total consumer loans increased 489.5 million to 4.08 billion. Total loans represent approximately 69.4 of assets as of December 31, 2022, as compared to 62.4 as of December 31, 2021.

Loans are summarized by business line which does not align with how the Company assesses credit risk in the estimate for credit losses under CECL.

Loans in the C I and CRE portfolios, consist primarily of loans made to small and medium-sized entities. The Company offers a variety of loan options to meet the specific needs of our commercial
 customers including term loans, time notes and lines of credit. Such loans are made available to businesses for working capital needs such as inventory and receivables, business expansion, equipment purchases, livestock purchases and seasonal
 crop expenses. These loans typically are usually collateralized by business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable and perishable agricultural products, which are exposed to industry price volatility. The Company offers CRE loans to
 finance real estate purchases, refinancings, expansions and improvements to commercial and agricultural properties. CRE loans are loans secured by liens on real estate, which may include both owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied properties, such
 as apartments, commercial structures, health care facilities and other facilities. Risks associated with the CRE portfolio include the ability of borrowers to pay interest and principal during the loan s term, as well as the ability of the
 borrowers to refinance at the end of the loan term. As of December 31, 2022, there were 196.3 million in CRE construction and development loans included in total loans.

The Company participated in the Small Business Administration s SBA PPP, a guaranteed, forgivable loan program created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriation Act targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the SBA, the guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit
 of the United States government. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make
 certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any
 representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent under the generally
 applicable Standardized Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. The Company processed approximately 6,100 loans totaling 835 million in relief with approximately 99 forgiven as of December 31, 2022.

Residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by a first or second mortgage on primary residences. We originate adjustable-rate and fixed-rate, one-to-four-family residential
 loans for the construction or purchase of a residential property or refinancing of a mortgage. These loans are collateralized by properties located in the Company s market area. Subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the
 residential housing market, is not a market that the Company has ever actively pursued. The market does not apply a uniform definition of what constitutes subprime lending. Our reference to subprime lending relies upon the Statement on
 Subprime Mortgage Lending issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the other federal bank regulatory agencies (the Agencies ), on June 29, 2007, which further referenced the Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs, or the
 Expanded Guidance, issued by the Agencies by press release dated January 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2022, there were 51.3 million in residential construction and development loans included in total loans.

In 2017, the Company partnered with Sungage Financial, LLC. to offer financing to consumers for solar ownership with the program tailored for delivery through solar installers. Advances of credit
 through this business line are to prime borrowers and are subject to the Company s underwriting standards. Typically, the Company collects fees at origination that are deferred and recognized into interest income over the estimated life of the
 loan.

The Company offers a variety of Consumer loan products including indirect auto, home equity and other consumer loans. Indirect auto loans include indirect installment loans to individuals, which are
 primarily secured by automobiles. Although automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Other Consumer
 loans consist of direct installment loans to individuals most secured by automobiles and other personal property and unsecured consumer loans across a national footprint originated through our relationship with national technology-driven consumer
 lending companies that began over 10 years ago beginning with our investment in Springstone Financial LLC Springstone which was subsequently acquired by LendingClub in 2014. In addition to installment loans, the Company also offers personal
 lines of credit, overdraft protection, home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans (loans secured by a lien position on one-to-four family residential real estate) to finance home improvements, debt consolidation, education and other
 uses. For home equity loans, consumers are able to borrow up to 85 of the equity in their homes, and are generally tied to Prime with a ten year draw followed by a fifteen year amortization.

Loans by Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table presents the maturity distribution and an analysis of loans that have predetermined and floating interest rates. Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in
 which the contractual maturity is due. For loans without contractual maturities, classification of maturity is consistent with the policy elections to measure the allowance for credit losses. Specifically, C I and CRE lines of credit assume
 one year maturity for relationships over 1.0 million and five year maturity for relationships under 1.0 million, while home equity line of credits maturities are classified based on their fixed rate conversion date plus five years. C I
 includes PPP and other consumer includes residential solar, home equity and other consumer loans.

Funding Sources and Corresponding Interest Expense

The Company utilizes traditional deposit products such as time, savings, NOW, money market and demand deposits as its primary source for funding. Other sources, such as short-term FHLB advances,
 federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered time deposits and long-term FHLB borrowings are utilized as necessary to support the Company s growth in assets and to achieve interest rate sensitivity objectives.
 The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities totaled 6.66 billion in 2022 and increased 66.7 million from 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in interest-bearing deposits, higher federal funds purchased and increased
 short-term borrowings as the Company shifted from an excess liquidity position to an overnight borrowing position at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.29 in 2021 to 0.33 
 in 2022. This increase in rates caused an increase in interest expense of 3.1 million, or 16.5 , from 18.8 million in 2021 to 21.9 million in 2022.

Deposits

Average interest-bearing deposits increased 46.7 million, or 0.7 , from 2021 to 2022. Average money market deposits decreased 139.8 million, or 5.4 during 2022 compared to 2021. Average NOW
 accounts increased 126.3 million, or 8.7 during 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to larger commercial customers taking advantage of higher yielding investment opportunities in both the Company s wealth management solutions as well as
 other attractive offerings in the market. The average balance of savings accounts increased 172.5 million, or 10.4 during 2022 compared to 2021. The average balance of time deposits decreased 112.2 million, or 19.4 , from 2021 to 2022. The
 average balance of demand deposits increased 131.3 million, or 3.7 , during 2022 compared to 2021.

The rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits was down 1 basis point to 0.16 for 2022. The rate paid for money market deposit accounts remained flat at 0.20 from 2021 to 2022. The rate paid
 for NOW deposit accounts increased from 0.05 in 2021 to 0.16 in 2022. The rate paid for savings deposits decreased from 0.05 in 2021 to 0.03 in 2022. The rate paid for time deposits decreased from 0.70 during 2021 to 0.38 during 2022.

 was 4.02 in 2022. Average repurchase agreements decreased to 69.6 million in 2022 from 100.5 million in 2021. The average rate paid on repurchase agreements decreased from 0.13 in 2021 to 0.10 in 2022. Average short-term borrowings increased
 to 46.4 million in 2022 from 1.3 million in 2021 due to a combination of loan growth and a decrease in deposits. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings increased from 2.00 in 2021 to 4.24 in 2022. Average long-term debt decreased from
 15.5 million in 2021 to 6.6 million in 2022. The average balance of junior subordinated debt remained at 101.2 million in 2022. The average rate paid for junior subordinated debt in 2022 was 3.70 , up from 2.07 in 2021.

Total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, which generally represent overnight borrowing transactions and other short-term
 borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, with original maturities of one year or less. The Company has unused lines of credit with the FHLB and access to brokered deposits available for short-term financing. Those sources totaled approximately 2.90
 billion and 3.45 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Securities collateralizing repurchase agreements are held in safekeeping by nonaffiliated financial institutions and are under the Company s control. Long-term debt, which is
 comprised primarily of FHLB advances, are collateralized by the FHLB stock owned by the Company, certain of its mortgage-backed securities and a blanket lien on its residential real estate mortgage loans.

On June 23, 2020, the Company issued 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital,
 bear interest at an annual rate of 5.00 , payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on January 1, 2021, and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread of 4.85 , payable
 quarterly in arrears commencing on October 1, 2025. The subordinated notes issuance costs of 2.2 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis into interest expense over five years. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the subordinated debt
 net of unamortized issuance costs was 98.5 million and 98.3 million, respectively. The Company repurchased 2.0 million of the subordinated notes during the year ended December 31, 2022 at a discount of 0.1 million.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 155.6 million, down 2.2 million, or 1.4 , from the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding net securities (losses) gains, noninterest income for the year
 ended December 31, 2022 was 156.7 million, down 0.5 million or 0.3 , from the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower card services income from the impact of the Company being subject to the statutory
 price cap provisions of the Durbin Amendment of approximately 8 million as well as lower other income drive by lower commercial loan swap fees. The decrease was partly offset by the increase in income from retirement plan administration fees
 driven by higher activity-based fees and continued organic growth and higher service charges on deposit accounts as the volume of transactions has normalized to near pre-pandemic levels.

Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 304.5 million, up 17.2 million or 6.0 , from the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2022, the Company incurred merger expenses of 1.0
 million related to the pending acquisition of Salisbury. Excluding merger expenses, noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 303.5 million, up 16.2 million or 5.6 , from the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase from
 the prior year was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits due to increased salaries and wages including merit pay increases and higher levels of incentive compensation accruals. In addition, the increase in technology and data services
 was due to continued investment in digital platform solutions and the increase in professional fees and outside services was due to external services for several tactical and strategic initiatives. Other expenses decreased from the prior year due
 to 4.3 million in estimated litigation settlement costs in 2021 related to a settled lawsuit regarding certain of the Company s deposit products and related disclosures, partly offset by higher travel and training expenditures along with an
 increase in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments.

Income Taxes

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year.
 Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions.

The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject at times to ongoing audits by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Future results may include
 favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are proposed or resolved or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire. As a result, the Company s effective tax rate may
 fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.

On August 16, 2022, H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA ), was signed into law. The IRA, among other things, introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax, excise tax on stock repurchases
 and a clean vehicle credit. The Company does not expect the impact to be material and will continue to monitor the impacts of the IRA on the business to determine if any future tax impacts may result from this legislation.

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 44.2 million, down 0.8 million, or 1.8 , from the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate was 22.5 in 2022 and 2021.

Risk Management Credit Risk

Credit risk is managed through a network of loan officers, credit committees, loan policies and oversight from senior credit officers and the Board of Directors. Management follows a policy of
 continually identifying, analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in each loan portfolio. An ongoing independent review of individual credits in the commercial loan portfolio is performed by the independent loan review function. These
 components of the Company s underwriting and monitoring functions are critical to the timely identification, classification and resolution of problem credits.

Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, restructured loans, other real estate owned OREO and nonperforming securities. Loans are
 generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual when circumstances indicate that the borrower may
 be unable to meet the contractual principal or interest payments. The threshold for evaluating classified and nonperforming loans specifically evaluated for individual credit loss is 1.0 million. OREO represents property acquired through
 foreclosure and is valued at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less any estimated disposal costs.

Total nonperforming assets were 21.2 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 32.9 million at December 31, 2021. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2022 were 21.1 million or 0.26 of total loans,
 compared with 32.7 million or 0.44 of total loans at December 31, 2021. The decrease in nonperforming loans primarily resulted from a reduction in commercial and residential nonaccrual loans. Total nonaccrual loans were 17.2 million or 0.21 of
 total loans at December 31, 2022, compared to 30.3 million or 0.40 of total loans at December 31, 2021. Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.33 at December 31, 2022, up slightly from 0.29 of total loans at December 31, 2021.

The allowance for credit losses was 478.72 of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2022 as compared to 280.98 at December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses was 584.92 of nonaccrual loans at
 December 31, 2022 as compared to 303.78 at December 31, 2021.

In addition to nonperforming loans discussed above, the Company has also identified approximately 52.0 million in potential problem loans at December 31, 2022 as compared to 74.9 million at
 December 31, 2021. Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, with a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Such loans may need to be disclosed as nonperforming at some time in the future. Potential problem
 loans are classified by the Company s loan rating system as substandard. The decrease in potential problem loans from December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the improved economic conditions which resulted in loans coming off deferral and
 returning to payment. Higher risk industries include entertainment, restaurants, retail, healthcare and accommodations. As of December 31, 2022, 8.2 of the Company s outstanding loans were in higher risk industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors, which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that other loans will not become over 90 days past
 due, be placed on nonaccrual, become restructured or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses. To mitigate this risk the Company maintains a diversified loan portfolio, has no significant concentration in any particular
 industry and originates loans primarily within its footprint.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company calculated the allowance for credit losses using current expected credit losses methodology. As a result of our January 1, 2020, adoption of CECL and its
 related amendments, our methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses changed significantly from December 31, 2019. The Company recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of 4.3 million as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative
 effect of adopting ASU 2016-13. The transition adjustment included a 3.0 million impact due to the allowance for credit losses on loans, 2.8 million impact due to the allowance for unfunded commitments reserve, and 1.5 million impact to the
 deferred tax asset.

Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical estimate given the degree of judgment exercised in evaluating the level of the allowance
 required to estimate expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the consolidated results of operations.

The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of a loan (or pool of loans). It replaces the incurred loss approach s threshold that required recognition of a
 credit loss when it was probable a loss event was incurred. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the loans amortized cost basis to present the net, lifetime amount expected to be collected on
 the loans. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes a loan balance is confirmed to be uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be
 charged-off.

Required additions or reductions to the allowance for credit losses are made periodically by charges or credits to the provision for loan losses. These are necessary to maintain the allowance at a
 level which management believes is reasonably reflective of the overall loss expected over the contractual life of the loan portfolio. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, additions or reductions to the
 allowance may fluctuate from one reporting period to another. These fluctuations are reflective of changes in risk associated with portfolio content and/or changes in management s assessment of any or all of the determining factors discussed
 above. Management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis of the loan portfolio.

Management estimates the allowance balance for credit losses using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
 supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Company historical loss experience was supplemented with peer information when there was insufficient loss data for the
 Company. Significant management judgment is required at each point in the measurement process.

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis that is applied on a quarterly basis, when similar risk characteristics
 exist. The respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using an econometric, discounted probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling methodology in which distinct, segment-specific multi-variate regression
 models are applied to multiple, probabilistically weighted external economic forecasts. Under the discounted cash flows methodology, expected credit losses are estimated over the effective life of the loans by measuring the difference between the
 net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments so that the allowance for credit loss is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that
 exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.

Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, management revised
 the manner in which loans were pooled for similar risk characteristics. Management developed segments for estimating loss based on type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation and have been
 combined or subsegmented as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled.

Additional information about our Allowance for Loan Losses is included in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements as well as in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the
 Management Discussion and Analysis. The Company s management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis of the loan portfolio.

The allowance for credit losses totaled 100.8 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 92.0 million at December 31, 2021. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.24 at
 December 31, 2022, compared to 1.23 at December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in loan balances, primarily due to the increase in
 residential solar loans, during 2022 and the slight deterioration in the economic forecast compared to prior year.

The provision for loan losses was 17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net benefit of 8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision expense increased from
 the prior year primarily due to deteriorated economic condition forecast in the current year as compared to significant improvements experienced in the economic condition forecast in the prior year and loan growth experienced during the current
 year. Net charge-offs totaled 8.3 million for 2022, down from 9.7 million in 2021. Net charge-offs to average loans was 11 bps for 2022 compared to 13 bps for 2021.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company has exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is
 unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as an expense in other noninterest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and
 an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments totaled 5.1 million. Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company
 calculated the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments using the incurred loss methodology.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternate funding sources. The
 objective of liquidity management is to ensure the Company can fund balance sheet growth, meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their
 credit needs. Management s Asset Liability Committee ALCO is responsible for liquidity management and has developed guidelines, which cover all assets and liabilities, as well as off-balance sheet items that are potential sources or uses of
 liquidity. Liquidity policies must also provide the flexibility to implement appropriate strategies, along with regular monitoring of liquidity and testing of the contingent liquidity plan. Requirements change as loans grow, deposits and
 securities mature and payments on borrowings are made. Liquidity management includes a focus on interest rate sensitivity management with a goal of avoiding widely fluctuating net interest margins through periods of changing economic conditions.
 Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest
 rates, the housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. Management continually monitors marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or
 asset prepayments.

The primary liquidity measurement the Company utilizes is called Basic Surplus, which captures the adequacy of its access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding mix
 of average liabilities. This approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity from short and long-term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources, which can be accessed when necessary. At
 December 31, 2022, the Company s Basic Surplus measurement was 13.2 of total assets, or 1.55 billion, as compared to the December 31, 2021 Basic Surplus of 28.5 , or 3.43 billion, and was above the Company s minimum of 5 (calculated at 587.0
 million and 600.6 million, of period end total assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively) set forth in its liquidity policies.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, FHLB advances outstanding totaled 443.8 million and 14.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had 8.0 million and 81.0 million,
 respectively, of collateral encumbered by municipal letters of credit. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system and had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of approximately 1.17 billion at December 31, 2022 and 1.67 billion at December
 31, 2021. In addition, unpledged securities could have been used to increase borrowing capacity at the FHLB by an additional 898.1 million and 999.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, or used to collateralize other borrowings,
 such as repurchase agreements. The Company also has the ability to issue brokered time deposits and to borrow against established borrowing facilities with other banks (federal funds), which could provide additional liquidity of 1.92 billion at
 December 31, 2022 and 2.03 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition, the Bank has a Borrower-in-Custody program with the FRB with the addition of the ability to pledge automobile loans as collateral. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank
 had the capacity to borrow 622.7 million and 580.8 million, respectively, from this program. The Company s internal policies authorize borrowing up to 25 of assets. Under this policy, remaining available borrowing capacity totaled 2.41
 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2.89 billion at December 31, 2021.

This Basic Surplus approach enables the Company to appropriately manage liquidity from both operational and contingency perspectives. By tempering the need for cash flow liquidity with reliable
 borrowing facilities, the Company is able to operate with a more fully invested and, therefore, higher interest income generating securities portfolio. The makeup and term structure of the securities portfolio is, in part, impacted by the overall
 interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet. Investment decisions and deposit pricing strategies are impacted by the liquidity position. The Company considers its Basic Surplus position to be strong. However, certain events may adversely
 impact the Company s liquidity position in 2023. Higher interest rates could result in deposit declines as depositors have alternative opportunities for yield on their excess funds. In the current economic environment, draws against lines of
 credit could drive asset growth higher. Disruptions in wholesale funding markets could spark increased competition for deposits. These scenarios could lead to a decrease in the Company s Basic Surplus measure below the minimum policy level of 5 .
 Significant monetary and fiscal policy actions taken by the federal government during the COVID-19 pandemic have helped to mitigate these risks. Enhanced liquidity monitoring was put in place to quickly respond to the changing environment during
 the COVID-19 pandemic including increasing the frequency of monitoring and adding additional sources of liquidity.

At December 31, 2022, a portion of the Company s loans and securities were pledged as collateral on borrowings. Therefore, once on-balance-sheet liquidity is depleted, future growth of earning
 assets will depend upon the Company s ability to obtain additional funding, through growth of core deposits and collateral management and may require further use of brokered time deposits or other higher cost borrowing arrangements.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 183.2 million and 159.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The critical elements of net operating cash flows include net income,
 adjusted for non-cash income and expense items such as the provision for loan losses, deferred income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and cash flows generated through changes in other assets and liabilities.

Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled 926.2 million and 547.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Critical elements of investing activities are loan and investment securities
 transactions.

Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled 328.7 million in 2022 and net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 984.8 million in 2021. The critical elements of financing
 activities are proceeds from deposits, borrowings and stock issuance. In addition, financing activities are impacted by dividends and treasury stock transactions.

Commitments to Extend Credit

The Company makes contractual commitments to extend credit, which include unused lines of credit, which are subject to the Company s credit approval and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2022
 and 2021, commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, including unused lines of credit, amounted to 2.42 billion and 2.30 billion, respectively. In the opinion of management, there are no material commitments to extend credit, including
 unused lines of credit that represent unusual risks. All commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, including unused lines of credit, expire within one year.

Standby Letters of Credit

The Company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability-recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters of credit. The Company guarantees the obligations or performance of
 customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third-parties. These standby letters of credit are generally issued in support of third-party debt, such as corporate debt issuances, industrial revenue bonds and municipal securities. The risk
 involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers and letters of credit are subject to the same credit origination, portfolio maintenance and management
 procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off-balance sheet products. Typically, these instruments have one year expirations with an option to renew upon annual review; therefore, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
 requirements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, outstanding standby letters of credit were approximately 53.3 million and 55.1 million, respectively. The fair value of the Company s standby letters of credit at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not
 significant.

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company
 has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the
 exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to
 variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the
 recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter
 into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated and
 that qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the cash flow hedges are reported in AOCI. When the cash flows associated with the hedged item are realized, the gain or loss included in AOCI is subsequently reclassified and recognized in
 the consolidated statements of income.

When the Company purchases or sells a portion of a commercial loan that has an existing interest rate swap, it may enter into a risk participation agreement to provide credit protection to the
 financial institution that originated the swap transaction should the borrower fail to perform on its obligation. The Company enters into both risk participation agreements in which it purchases credit protection from other financial institutions
 and those in which it provides credit protection to other financial institutions. Any fee paid to the Company under a risk participation agreement is in consideration of the credit risk of the counterparties and is recognized in the income
 statement. Credit risk on the risk participation agreements is determined after considering the risk rating, probability of default and loss given default of the counterparties.

Loans Serviced for Others and Loans Sold with Recourse

The total amount of loans serviced by the Company for unrelated third parties was approximately 576.0 million and 575.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022
 and 2021, the Company had approximately 0.6 million and 1.0 million, respectively, of mortgage servicing rights. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company serviced Springstone consumer loans of 6.2 million and 11.4 million,
 respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company serviced 31.0 million and 25.6 million, respectively, of agricultural loans sold with recourse. Due to sufficient collateral on these loans and government guarantees, no reserve is
 considered necessary at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Capital Resources

Consistent with its goal to operate a sound and profitable financial institution, the Company actively seeks to maintain a well-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. The
 principal source of capital to the Company is earnings retention. The Company s capital measurements are in excess of both regulatory minimum guidelines and meet the requirements to be considered well-capitalized.

The Company s primary source of funds to pay interest on trust preferred debentures and pay cash dividends to its stockholders are dividends from its subsidiaries. Various laws and regulations
 restrict the ability of banks to pay dividends to their stockholders. Generally, the payment of dividends by the Company in the future as well as the payment of interest on the capital securities will require the generation of sufficient future
 earnings by its subsidiaries.

The Bank also is subject to substantial regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC regulations, the Bank may not
 pay a dividend, without prior OCC approval, if the total amount of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of its retained net income to date during the calendar year and its retained net
 income over the preceding two years. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 145.3 million and 164.6 million, respectively, of the total stockholders equity of the Bank was available for payment of dividends to the Company without
 approval by the OCC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends also is subject to the Bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is currently in compliance with these requirements. Under the State of Delaware General
 Corporation Law, the Company may declare and pay dividends either out of accumulated net retained earnings or capital surplus.

ITEM 7A. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the
 normal course of the Company s business activities or are immaterial to the results of operations.

Interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on the Company s net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate
 risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in
 market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income.

To manage the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates, management monitors the Company s interest rate risk. Management s Asset Liability Committee ALCO meets monthly to review the
 Company s interest rate risk position and profitability and to recommend strategies for consideration by the Board of Directors. Management also reviews loan and deposit pricing and the Company s securities portfolio, formulates investment and
 funding strategies and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the Board s objectives in the most effective manner. Notwithstanding the Company s interest rate risk management activities, the potential for
 changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income.

In adjusting the Company s asset/liability position, the Board and management aim to manage the Company s interest rate risk while minimizing net interest margin compression. At times, depending on
 the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Board and management may determine to increase the Company s interest rate risk position somewhat in
 order to increase its net interest margin. The Company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the difference between long and short-term interest rates.

The primary tool utilized by the ALCO to manage interest rate risk is earnings at risk modeling (interest rate sensitivity analysis). Information, such as principal balance, interest rate, maturity
 date, cash flows, next repricing date (if needed) and current rates are uploaded into the model to create an ending balance sheet. In addition, the ALCO makes certain assumptions regarding prepayment speeds for loans and mortgage related investment
 securities along with any optionality within the deposits and borrowings. The model is first run under an assumption of a flat rate scenario (e.g., no change in current interest rates) with a static balance sheet. Three additional models are run in
 which a gradual increase of 200 bps, a gradual increase of 100 bps and a gradual decrease of 200 bps takes place over a 12-month period with a static balance sheet. Under these scenarios, assets subject to prepayments are adjusted to account for
 faster or slower prepayment assumptions. Any investment securities or borrowings that have callable options embedded in them are handled accordingly based on the interest rate scenario. The resulting changes in net interest income are then measured
 against the flat rate scenario. The Company also runs other interest rate scenarios to highlight potential interest rate risk.

In the declining rate scenario, net interest income is projected to decrease when compared to the forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario through the simulation period. The decrease
 in net interest income is a result of earning assets repricing and rolling over at lower yields at a faster pace than interest-bearing liabilities decline and/or reach their floors. In the rising rate scenarios, net interest income is projected to
 experience an increase from the flat rate scenario; however, the potential impact on earnings may be affected by the ability to lag deposit repricing on NOW, savings, money market deposit accounts and time accounts. Net interest income for the next
 twelve months in the +200/+100/-200 bp scenarios, as described above, is within the internal policy risk limits of not more than a 7.5 reduction in net interest income. The following table summarizes the percentage change in net interest income in
 the rising and declining rate scenarios over a 12-month period from the forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario using the December 31, 2022 balance sheet position:

(3.99

The Company anticipates that the trajectory of net interest income will continue to depend significantly on the timing and path of short to mid-term interest rates which are heavily driven by
 inflationary pressures and FOMC monetary policy. In response to the economic impact of the pandemic, the federal funds rate was reduced to near zero in March 2020, term interest rates fell sharply across the yield curve and the Company reduced
 deposit rates. Post-pandemic, inflationary pressures have resulted in a higher overall yield curve, Fed Funds increases of 425 bps in 2022 and expectations for continued increases to short-term interest rates in 2023. With deposit rates coming
 off their historic lows, the Company will focus on managing deposit expense in a rising rate environment while allowing assets to reprice upward.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
 SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

NBT Bancorp Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NBT Bancorp Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
 related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial
 statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
 the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal
 control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
 consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
 rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
 statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
 audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
 basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
 communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
 judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion
 on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses loans evaluated on a collective basis

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for credit losses on loans evaluated on a
 collective basis (the collective ACL on loans) was 100.8 million of a total allowance for credit losses of 100.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The collective ACL on loans includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled)
 basis for class segments of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology where the respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured by comparing the amortized cost to the present
 value of expected principal, interest and recovery cash flows projected using an econometric, probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling methodology. The Company uses PD regression models to develop the PD, and LGD models to
 develop the LGD, using historical credit loss experience for both the Company and segment-specific selected peers. The application of these models incorporates multiple weighted external economic forecasts for the economic variables over the
 reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to long-term average economic variables over a reversion period on a straight-line basis. Contractual cash flows over the
 contractual life of the loans are the basis for expected principal, interest and recovery cash flows, adjusted for modeled defaults and expected prepayments and discounted at the loan-level effective interest rate. After quantitative considerations,
 the Company applies additional qualitative adjustments, giving consideration to the effects of limitations inherent in the quantitative model, so that the collective ACL is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the loan
 portfolio at the balance sheet date.

We identified the assessment of the collective ACL on loans as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including
 specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL on loans due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the
 collective ACL on loans methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and their significant assumptions including portfolio segmentation, the external economic forecasts and economic variables, and the related
 weighting of the forecasts, the reasonable and supportable forecast periods, the composition of the peer group and the period from which historical Company and peer experience was used, (2) the expected prepayments assumption, and (3) the qualitative
 adjustments and the significant assumptions, including the effects of limitations inherent in the quantitative model. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD regression and LGD models. In
 addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the
 operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s measurement of the collective ACL on loans estimate, including controls over the:

development of the collective ACL on loans methodology

development of the PD regression models

continued use and appropriateness of changes made to PD regression and LGD models

performance monitoring of the PD regression and LGD models

identification and determination of the expected prepayments assumption and the significant assumptions used in the PD regression and LGD models

development of the qualitative methodology, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of select qualitative adjustments

analysis of the collective ACL on loans results, trends, and ratios.

We evaluated the Company s process to develop the collective ACL on loans estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and
 assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

evaluating the Company s collective ACL on loans methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development and performance monitoring of the PD regression and LGD models, by comparing
 them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry practices

assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD regression and LGD models, by inspecting the model documentation to determine
 whether the models are suitable for their intended use

evaluating the expected prepayments assumption by comparing to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and current economic considerations

evaluating the selection of economic forecast scenarios, including weighting of the scenarios, and underlying economic variables, by comparing to the
 Company s business environment and relevant industry practices

evaluating the length of the period from which historical Company and peer experience was used and the reasonable and supportable forecast period by
 comparing them to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends

assessing the composition of the peer group by comparing to Company and specific portfolio risk characteristics

determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company s business environment, loan
 portfolio categories and sub-categories and relevant industry practices

evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative adjustments and the effect of those adjustments on the collective ACL on loans by
 comparing to relevant credit risk factors, the current economic environment and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.

We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACL on loans estimate by evaluating the:

cumulative results of the audit procedures

qualitative aspects of the Company s accounting practices

potential bias in the accounting estimate.

and individual securities,
 respectively, represented a credit loss impairment. AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the majority of the AFS securities in an
 unrealized loss position consisted of debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises that carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, which are widely recognized as risk-free and
 have a long history of zero credit losses. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment
 securities. The Company does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The Company elected to exclude accrued
 interest receivable AIR from the amortized cost basis of debt securities. AIR on AFS debt securities totaled million at December
 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and reported in the other assets financial statement line.

of the bank s HTM debt securities were past due
 or on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. There was accrued interest reversed against interest income for the years
 ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as all securities remained on accrual status. In addition, there were collateral-dependent HTM
 debt securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and , respectively, of the Company s HTM debt securities were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit
 and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as risk free, and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of December 31, 2022 and
 2021. The remaining HTM debt securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were comprised of state and municipal obligations generally with bond ratings of A to AAA. Utilizing the CECL approach, the Company determined that the expected credit loss on its
 HTM municipal bond portfolio was immaterial and therefore no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. AIR on HTM debt securities totaled million at December 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021 and is
 excluded from the estimate of credit losses and reported in the other assets financial statement line.

 Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. No changes were made to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this
 report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of NBT Bancorp Inc. (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial
 reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s
 consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting
 established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, management determined that
 the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on the
 effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
 2022, is included in this Item under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

NBT Bancorp Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited NBT Bancorp Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
 established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In
 our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
 sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and
 the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion 

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
 of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based
 on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
 and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
 reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
 considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
 reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
 evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 in fact confidential business information of the Company or its affiliates or are entrusted to third parties. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, procedures, methods, sales relationships developed while in the service of the
 Company or its affiliates, knowledge of customers and their requirements, marketing plans, marketing information, studies, forecasts, and surveys, competitive analyses, mailing and marketing lists, new business proposals, lists of vendors, consultants,
 and other persons who render service or provide material to the Company or its affiliates, and compositions, ideas, plans, and methods belonging to or related to the affairs of the Company or its affiliates (collectively, Confidential Information ). 

In this regard, the Company asserts proprietary rights in all of its Confidential Information and that of its affiliates, except for such information as is clearly in the public domain. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information that would be
 generally known or available to persons skilled in Executive s fields shall be considered to be clearly in the public domain for the purposes of the preceding sentence. Executive acknowledges that in connection with her employment with the Company,
 Executive has had or may have access to such Confidential Information, and she agrees that she will not disclose or divulge to any third party, except as may be required by her duties hereunder, by law, regulation, or order of a court or government
 authority, or as directed by the Company, nor shall she use to the detriment of the Company or its affiliates or use in any business or on behalf of any business competitive with or substantially similar to any business of the Company or its
 affiliates, any Confidential Information obtained during the course of her employment by the Company. In the event that disclosure is required by law, regulation, or order of a court or government authority, Executive agrees that as soon as practical
 and in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice that Executive is required to make such disclosure, Executive will provide notice to the Company of such requirement by law, regulation, or order of a court or government
 authority. This Section 4(a) shall not be construed as restricting Executive from disclosing such information to the employees of the Company or its affiliates. On or before the Termination Date, Executive shall promptly deliver to the
 Company any and all Confidential Information in her possession, whether tangible, electronic, or intangible in form.

(b) Executive acknowledges that in the course of employment with the Company, Executive has had and will have access to and gained knowledge of the trade secrets and other Confidential
 Information of the Company and its affiliates; has had and will have substantial relationships with the customers of the Company and its affiliates; and has performed and will perform services of special, unique, and extraordinary value to the Company
 and its affiliates. Therefore, Executive agrees that notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement for any reason, from the Commencement Date until the second (2 nd anniversary of the Termination Date, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of herself or any other person or entity, without the written consent of the Company:

(i) become an officer, employee, consultant, director, or trustee of any savings bank, savings and loan association, savings and loan holding company, bank or bank holding company, where
 such position entails providing services to such company in any city, town, or county in which the Company or its affiliates has an office, determined as of the Termination Date, where Executive s position or service for such business is competitive
 with or otherwise similar to any of Executive s positions or services for the Company or its affiliates;

- 6 - 

(ii) induce or solicit any customer, supplier, or agent of the Company or its affiliates about whom Executive has gained Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of her
 employment with the Company, has established a relationship or had frequent contact, to terminate or curtail an existing business or commercial relationship with the Company or its affiliates;

(iii) induce or solicit any customer or supplier of the Company or its affiliates about whom Executive has gained Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of her employment
 with the Company, has established a relationship or had frequent contact, to provide or purchase goods or services similar to the goods or services provided by it to or purchased by it from the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that the
 provisions of this clause (iii) only apply to those persons or entities who are customers or suppliers of the Company or its affiliates as of the Termination Date or who were customers of the Company or its affiliates during the one-year period prior
 to the Termination Date; or

(iv) solicit, induce, recruit, offer employment to, hire, or take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
 causing any officer or employee of NBTB, NBT Bank, or their affiliates, to terminate his or her employment.

(c) Executive acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to the Company in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Section 4 (the Designated
 Provisions and that the Company will have no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of any Designated Provision, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy the Company may have,
 the Company shall be entitled to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction in Chenango County, New York, or elsewhere, to restrain the violation or
 breach thereof by Executive, and Executive submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.

(d) It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section 4 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in
 each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Section 4 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom the portion thus
 adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. In addition, should any court determine that the provisions of
 this Section 4 shall be unenforceable with respect to scope, duration, or geographic area, such court shall be empowered to substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar hereto or other provisions so as to provide to the Company, to
 the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by this Section 4 . The existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the
 provisions of Section 4 , but such claim or cause of action shall be determined separately.

- 7 - 

(e) The length of time for which the covenants in Section 4 shall be in force shall be extended by an amount of time equal to the period of time during which a violation of such covenant is
 deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to have occurred (including any period required for litigation during which the Company seeks to enforce such covenant).

(f) U.S. federal law (18 U.S.C. section 1833(b)) states that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a
 trade secret that: (i) is made (A) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is
 made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. That law further states that an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law
 may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual: (1) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (2) does not disclose the trade secret,
 except pursuant to court order. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall be construed to, conflict with 18 U.S.C. section 1833(b).

(g) Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement that Executive may have with the Company restricts or prohibits Executive from initiating communications directly
 with, responding to any inquiries from, providing testimony before, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, filing a claim with or assisting with an investigation by a self-regulatory authority or a government agency or entity, including
 but not limited to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (collectively, Government Agencies ), or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower
 provisions of state or federal law or regulation, and Executive does not need the Company s prior authorization to engage in such conduct.

5. Life Insurance . In light of the unusual abilities and experience of Executive, NBTB (or NBT Bank or their affiliates) in its discretion may apply for and procure as owner and for
 its own benefit insurance on the life of Executive, in such amount and in such form as NBTB may choose. NBTB shall make all payments for such insurance and shall receive all benefits from it. Executive shall have no interest whatsoever in any such
 policy or policies but, at the request of NBTB, shall submit to medical examinations and supply such information and execute such documents as may reasonably be required by the insurance company or companies to which NBTB has applied for insurance. 

6. Payments Upon Termination .

 vision, and long-term care insurance plans, but excluding disability or accidental death and dismemberment insurance) in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Termination Date, as in effect at the Termination Date, or, if
 more favorable to Executive and, if applicable, Executive s spouse and dependents, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to executive employees of the Company or any successor; provided that Executive s continued eligibility for

 benefit plan, program, or arrangement of another employer which confers substantially similar benefits upon Executive, Executive shall cease to receive benefits under this subsection in respect of such plan, program, or arrangement; provided, further,
 that for health benefits that extend beyond the COBRA limitation period, the Company shall pay Executive an amount equal to the benefits that Executive would have received under this Section 6(c)(i)(B)(1) without regard to such limitation, and
 (2) Executive s benefit under any retirement plans maintained by the Company in which Executive is a participant shall be fully vested upon the Termination Date. In the event that Executive s participation in any such plan, program, or arrangement is

 under such plans, programs, and arrangements or alternatively, pay an amount equal to the reasonable value of such substantially similar benefits. If Executive elects or, if applicable, her spouse or dependents elect, COBRA continuation coverage after
 the Termination Date, the Company will pay the applicable COBRA premium for the maximum period during which such coverage is available. Executive and, if applicable, Executive s spouse and dependents may elect, in lieu of COBRA continuation coverage,
 to have the acquiring entity obtain an individual or group health insurance coverage and the acquiring entity will pay premiums thereunder for the maximum period during which you and, if applicable, your spouse and family could have elected to receive

 months of a Change in Control (it being recognized that more than one such event may occur, in which case the twenty-four (24)-month period shall run from the date of each such occurrence), Executive s benefits shall thereafter be determined in
 accordance with the Company s long-term disability income insurance plan. If the Company s long-term disability income insurance plan is modified or terminated following a Change in Control, the Company shall substitute such a plan with benefits
 applicable to Executive substantially similar to those provided by such plan prior to its modification or termination. During any period that Executive fails to perform her duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness,
 Executive shall continue to receive her Base Salary at the rate then in effect until her employment is termi-nated by the Company for Disability.

 transfer consummated at the insistence of an appropriate banking regulatory agency shall not constitute a change in control of NBTB;

(D) Approval by the shareholders of NBTB of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of NBTB; or

(E) Any event which would be described in Subsections (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this Section 6(c)(iii) if NBT Bank were substituted for NBTB therein.

 NBTB, NBT Bank, or any subsidiary of either of them or (2) by any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them.

 employees, from any and all claims or potential claims arising from or related to Executive s employment with NBTB, NBT Bank, or any of their affiliates or Executive s termination of employment. If the Release is executed and delivered and no longer
 subject to revocation as provided in the preceding sentence, payments or benefits shall commence upon the first scheduled payment date immediately after the date the Release is executed and no longer subject to revocation (the Release Effective
 Date ). The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this Agreement applied as though such payments commenced immediately upon
 Executive s Termination Date, and any payments made thereafter shall continue as provided herein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced immediately following Executive s
 Termination Date. 

- 11 - 

The Company may provide, in its sole discretion, that Executive may continue to participate in any benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 6(d) during the period of such delay, provided that
 Executive shall bear the full cost of such benefits during such delay period. Upon the date such benefits would otherwise commence pursuant to this Section 6(d) , the Company may reimburse Executive the Company s share of the cost of such
 benefits, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, in each case had such benefits commenced immediately
 upon Executive s Termination Date. Any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the schedule and procedures specified herein.

 another employer after the Termination Date or otherwise.

 or orders issued by the Office of the Controller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other state or federal banking regulatory agency having jurisdiction over NBTB or NBT Bank, and no payment shall be required to be
 made to or for the benefit of Executive under this Agreement to the extent such payment is prohibited by applicable law, regulation, or order issued by a banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, that it shall be the Company s
 burden to prove that any such action was so required.

7. Maximization of After-Tax Amounts . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event any payments or benefits Executive becomes entitled to pursuant to this
 Agreement or any other payments or benefits received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control or termination of employment (whether pursuant to the terms of any other agreement, plan, or arrangement, or otherwise, with the
 Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control, or any affiliate of the Company or such Person) (collectively the Payments will be subject to the tax (the Excise Tax imposed by Code Section 4999, the payments or
 benefits due under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Payments will not result in the imposition of such Excise Tax. The Payment reduction contemplated by the preceding sentence shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment
 Ratio (as defined below) for each parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G Section 280G ), and then reducing the parachute payments in order beginning with the parachute payment with the highest Parachute Payment
 Ratio. For parachute payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such parachute payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such parachute payments with amounts having later payment dates being reduced first. For parachute
 payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such parachute payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing parachute payments with a lower Parachute Payment Ratio. For purposes
 hereof, the term Parachute Payment Ratio shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable parachute payment for purposes of Section 280G and the denominator of which is the intrinsic value of such parachute
 payment. For purposes of determining whether any of the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) the entire amount of the Payments shall be treated as parachute payments within the meaning of Code Section
 280G(b)(2) and as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and to the extent, in the written opinion of the Company s independent accountants and as reasonably acceptable to Executive, such payments (in whole or in part) are not subject to the Excise Tax; and
 (ii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit (constituting a part of the Payments) shall be determined by the Company s independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Code Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4). 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Payments exceed three (3) times Executive s base amount as defined within Section 280G and (ii) Executive would receive at least 50,000 more on a net after-tax basis if her Payments were not reduced pursuant
 to this Section 7 (after Executive s payment of the Excise Tax), then the Company will not reduce the Payments to Executive, and Executive shall be responsible for the Excise Tax related thereto. For purposes of determining the net after-tax
 benefit, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of the federal income taxation applicable to individuals (without taking into account surtaxes or loss or reduction of deductions) for the calendar year in
 which the Termination Date occurs and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of taxation in the state and locality of your residence on the Termination Date. 

8. Representations and Warranties .

(a) Executive represents and warrants to the Company that her execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement will not result in or constitute a breach of or conflict with any term,
 covenant, condition, or provision of any commitment, contract, or other agreement or instrument, including, without limitation, any other employment agreement, to which Executive is or has been a party.

(b) Executive shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company for, from, and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, expenses, or liabilities, including court costs and

 of Executive in Section 8(a) hereof to be true and correct when made.

 the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge, or termination is sought. No waiver, by either party hereto at any time, of any breach by the other party hereto or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed

14. 409A Compliance .

(a) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the
 maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall NBTB, NBT Bank, or any of their directors, officers, employees, or agents be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty
 that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes
 deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset, counterclaim, or recoupment by any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executive s right
 to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.

 is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Executive s separation from service, and (B) the date of Executive s death (the Delay Period ), to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Upon
 the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section 14 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum, and
 all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein; and

(ii) To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period are considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A provided on account of a separation from service, and
 such benefits are not otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A, Executive shall pay the cost of such benefits during the Delay Period, and the Company shall reimburse Executive, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company
 or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, the Company s share of the cost of such benefits upon expiration of the Delay Period, and any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or
 provided by the Company in accordance with the procedures specified herein.

15. Arbitration . Subject to the right of each party to seek specific performance (which right shall not be subject to arbitration) and to seek injunctive relief or other equitable
 relief in connection with or by reason of a breach or threatened breach of Section 4 (where the party has elected not to pursue such relief in arbitration
 pursuant to this Section 15 , if a dispute arises out of or is in any way related to this Agreement or the asserted breach thereof, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration before
 the American Arbitration Association the AAA pursuant to the AAA s National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (the Arbitration Rules ). A dispute subject to the provisions of this Section 15 will exist if
 either party notifies the other party in writing that a dispute subject to arbitration exists and states, with reasonable specificity, the issue subject to arbitration (the Arbitration Notice ). The parties agree that, after the issuance of
 the Arbitration Notice, the parties will try in good faith between the date of the issuance of the Arbitration Notice and the date the dispute is set for arbitration to resolve the dispute by mediation in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. If the
 dispute is not resolved by the date set for arbitration, then any controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement or the asserted breach hereof shall be resolved by binding arbitration and judgment upon any award rendered by arbitrator(s) may be
 entered in a court having jurisdiction. In the event any claim or dispute involves an amount in excess of 100,000, either party may request that the matter be heard and resolved by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the same power to
 compel the attendance of witnesses and to order the production of documents or other materials and to enforce discovery as could be exercised by a United States District Court judge sitting in Chenango County, New York. In the event of any
 arbitration, each party shall have a reasonable right to conduct discovery to the same extent permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that discovery shall be concluded within ninety (90) days after the date the matter is set for
 arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall have the power to award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party. Any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Section 15 shall be governed by the Federal
 Arbitration Act, and the parties have entered into this Agreement pursuant to such act. 

- 16 - 

16. Costs of Litigation . In the event litigation is commenced to enforce any of the provisions hereof, or to obtain declaratory relief in connection with any of the provisions hereof,
 the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees. In the event this Agreement is asserted in any litigation as a defense to any liability, claim, demand, action, cause of action, or right asserted in such litigation, the
 party prevailing on the issue of that defense shall be entitled to recovery of reasonable attorneys fees. 

17. Company Right to Recover . If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company as a result of misconduct, with regard to
 any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and Executive is subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Executive knowingly engaged in the misconduct, was grossly negligent in engaging in
 the misconduct, knowingly failed to prevent the misconduct, or was grossly negligent in failing to prevent the misconduct, Executive shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment earned or accrued during the twelve (12)-month period following
 the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document that contained such material noncompliance. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, Executive will forfeit any payments made based on the achievement of pre-established
 performance goals that are later determined, as a result of the accounting restatement, not to have been achieved.

To the extent that any payment is made to Executive pursuant to this Agreement and information later becomes available that would have led to supervisory disapproval of the payment, then the Company
 and its successors expressly reserve the right to suspend or deny full allocation of all remaining payments and/or compel repayment of any or all dispersed payments, should later information warrant such action. Subsequent information which would lead
 to the exercise of these rights would include, without limitation, any information indicating that Executive has committed, is substantially responsible for, or has violated the respective acts or omissions, conditions, or offenses outlined in 12
 C.F.R. section 359.4(a)(4).

- 17 - 

18. Cooperation . The parties agree that certain matters in which Executive will be involved during the Term of Employment may necessitate Executive s cooperation in the future.
 Accordingly, following the termination of Executive s employment for any reason, to the extent reasonably requested by the Board, Executive shall cooperate with the Company in connection with matters arising out of Executive s service to the Company;
 provided, that the Company shall make reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Executive s other activities. The Company shall reimburse Executive for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation and, to the extent that
 Executive is required to spend substantial time on such matters, the Company shall compensate the Executive at an hourly rate based on Executive s Base Salary on the Termination Date or at another mutually agreed upon rate. 

19. Affiliation . A company will be deemed to be an affiliate of, or affiliated with NBTB or NBT Bank according to the definition of Affiliate set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the
 General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act. 

20. Headings . The section and subsection headings herein have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions
 hereof. 

21. Survival . Sections 4, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable

(a) Executive acknowledges that certain business methods, creative techniques, and technical data of the Company and any of its affiliates and the like are deemed by the Company to be and
 are in fact confidential business information of the Company or its affiliates or are entrusted to third parties. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, procedures, methods, sales relationships developed while in the
 service of the Company or its affiliates, knowledge of customers and their requirements, marketing plans, marketing information, studies, forecasts, and surveys, competitive analyses, mailing and marketing lists, new business proposals, lists of
 vendors, consultants, and other persons who render service or provide material to the Company or its affiliates, and compositions, ideas, plans, and methods belonging to or related to the affairs of the Company or its affiliates (collectively, Confidential

Information ). In this regard, the Company asserts proprietary rights in all of its Confidential Information and that of its affiliates, except for such information as is clearly in the public domain. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 information that would be generally known or available to persons skilled in Executive s fields shall be considered to be clearly in the public domain for the purposes of the preceding sentence. Executive acknowledges that in connection with his
 employment with the Company, Executive has had or may have access to such Confidential Information, and he agrees that he will not disclose or divulge to any third party, except as may be required by his duties hereunder, by law, regulation, or
 order of a court or government authority, or as directed by the Company, nor shall he use to the detriment of the Company or its affiliates or use in any business or on behalf of any business competitive with or substantially similar to any
 business of the Company or its affiliates, any Confidential Information obtained during the course of his employment by the Company. In the event that disclosure is required by law, regulation, or order of a court or government authority,
 Executive agrees that as soon as practical and in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice that Executive is required to make such disclosure, Executive will provide notice to the Company of such requirement by law,
 regulation, or order of a court or government authority. This Section 4(a) shall not be construed as restricting Executive from disclosing such information to the employees of the Company or its affiliates. On or before the Termination
 Date, Executive shall promptly deliver to the Company any and all Confidential Information in his possession, whether tangible, electronic, or intangible in form.

(b) Executive acknowledges that in the course of employment with the Company, Executive has had and will have access to and gained knowledge of the trade secrets and other Confidential
 Information of the Company and its affiliates; has had and will have substantial relationships with the customers of the Company and its affiliates; and has performed and will perform services of special, unique, and extraordinary value to the
 Company and its affiliates. Therefore, Executive agrees that notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement for any reason, from the Commencement Date until the second (2 nd anniversary of the Termination Date, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other person or entity, without the written consent of the Company:

(i) become an officer, employee, consultant, director, or trustee of any savings bank, savings and loan association, savings and loan holding company, bank or bank holding company,
 where such position entails providing services to such company in any city, town, or county in which the Company or its affiliates has an office, determined as of the Termination Date, where Executive s position or service for such business is
 competitive with or otherwise similar to any of Executive s positions or services for the Company or its affiliates;

(ii) induce or solicit any customer, supplier, or agent of the Company or its affiliates about whom Executive has gained Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of his
 employment with the Company, has established a relationship or had frequent contact, to terminate or curtail an existing business or commercial relationship with the Company or its affiliates;

- 6 - 

(iii) induce or solicit any customer or supplier of the Company or its affiliates about whom Executive has gained Confidential Information or with whom Executive, by virtue of his
 employment with the Company, has established a relationship or had frequent contact, to provide or purchase goods or services similar to the goods or services provided by it to or purchased by it from the Company or its affiliates; provided,
 however, that the provisions of this clause (iii) only apply to those persons or entities who are customers or suppliers of the Company or its affiliates as of the Termination Date or who were customers of the Company or its affiliates during the
 one-year period prior to the Termination Date; or

(iv) solicit, induce, recruit, offer employment to, hire, or take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
 causing any officer or employee of NBTB, NBT Bank, or their affiliates, to terminate his or her employment.

The parties understand and agree that the provisions of Section 4 shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable rules of professional conduct for attorneys, and
 nothing in Section 4 shall prohibit Executive from working in a legal capacity (i.e., as in-house counsel) or from practicing law in any capacity in any jurisdiction after the termination of Executive s employment with the
 Company.

(c) Executive acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to the Company in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Section 4 (the Designated
 Provisions and that the Company will have no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of any Designated Provision, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy the Company may
 have, the Company shall be entitled to seek the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction in Chenango County, New York, or elsewhere, to restrain the
 violation or breach thereof by Executive, and Executive submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.

(d) It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section 4 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied
 in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Section 4 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom the portion
 thus adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. In addition, should any court determine that the
 provisions of this Section 4 shall be unenforceable with respect to scope, duration, or geographic area, such court shall be empowered to substitute, to the extent enforceable, provisions similar hereto or other provisions so as to provide
 to the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefits intended by this Section 4 . The existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement
 by the Company of the provisions of Section 4 , but such claim or cause of action shall be determined separately.

- 7 - 

(e) The length of time for which the covenants in Section 4 shall be in force shall be extended by an amount of time equal to the period of time during which a violation of such covenant
 is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to have occurred (including any period required for litigation during which the Company seeks to enforce such covenant).

(f) U.S. federal law (18 U.S.C. section 1833(b)) states that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of
 a trade secret that: (i) is made (A) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or
 (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. That law further states that an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected
 violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual: (1) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (2) does not
 disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall be construed to, conflict with 18 U.S.C. section 1833(b).

(g) Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement that Executive may have with the Company restricts or prohibits Executive from initiating communications
 directly with, responding to any inquiries from, providing testimony before, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, filing a claim with or assisting with an investigation by a self-regulatory authority or a government agency or
 entity, including but not limited to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (collectively, Government Agencies ), or from making other disclosures that are protected under
 the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation, and Executive does not need the Company s prior authorization to engage in such conduct.

5. Life Insurance . In light of the unusual abilities and experience of Executive, NBTB (or NBT Bank or their affiliates) in its discretion may apply for and procure as owner and
 for its own benefit insurance on the life of Executive, in such amount and in such form as NBTB may choose. NBTB shall make all payments for such insurance and shall receive all benefits from it. Executive shall have no interest whatsoever in any
 such policy or policies but, at the request of NBTB, shall submit to medical examinations and supply such information and execute such documents as may reasonably be required by the insurance company or companies to which NBTB has applied for
 insurance.

6. Payments Upon Termination .

 dental, vision, and long-term care insurance plans, but excluding disability or accidental death and dismemberment insurance) in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Termination Date, as in effect at the Termination
 Date, or, if more favorable to Executive and, if applicable, Executive s spouse and dependents, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to executive employees of the Company or any successor; provided that Executive s continued

 arrangement; provided, further, that for health benefits that extend beyond the COBRA limitation period, the Company shall pay Executive an amount equal to the benefits that Executive would have received under this Section 6(c)(i)(B)(1) 
 without regard to such limitation, and (2) Executive s benefit under any retirement plans maintained by the Company in which Executive is a participant shall be fully vested upon the Termination Date. In the event that Executive s participation in

 to those which Executive is entitled to receive under such plans, programs, and arrangements or alternatively, pay an amount equal to the reasonable value of such substantially similar benefits. If Executive elects or, if applicable, his spouse or
 dependents elect, COBRA continuation coverage after the Termination Date, the Company will pay the applicable COBRA premium for the maximum period during which such coverage is available. Executive and, if applicable, Executive s spouse and
 dependents may elect, in lieu of COBRA continuation coverage, to have the acquiring entity obtain an individual or group health insurance coverage and the acquiring entity will pay premiums thereunder for the maximum period during which you and, if

 (24) months of a Change in Control (it being recognized that more than one such event may occur, in which case the twenty-four (24)-month period shall run from the date of each such occurrence), Executive s benefits shall thereafter be determined
 in accordance with the Company s long-term disability income insurance plan. If the Company s long-term disability income insurance plan is modified or terminated following a Change in Control, the Company shall substitute such a plan with
 benefits applicable to Executive substantially similar to those provided by such plan prior to its modification or termination. During any period that Executive fails to perform his duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical or
 mental illness, Executive shall continue to receive his Base Salary at the rate then in effect until his employment is termi-nated by the Company for Disability.

(iii) A Change in Control of the Company shall mean the occurrence of one of the following:

(A) A change in control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A, as in effect on the date hereof, pursuant to the

(C) There shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of NBTB in which NBTB is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which Voting Securities would be

 after the merger, or (y) any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of NBTB, provided that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, exchange,
 or other transfer consummated at the insistence of an appropriate banking regulatory agency shall not constitute a change in control of NBTB;

(D) Approval by the shareholders of NBTB of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of NBTB; or

(E) Any event which would be described in Subsections (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this Section 6(c)(iii) if NBT Bank were substituted for NBTB therein.

 by NBTB, NBT Bank, or any subsidiary of either of them or (2) by any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them.

(iv) Within five (5) days following the consummation of a Change in Control of the Company, the Company (or its successor) shall establish a trust that conforms in all regards with the

 Agreement and Release, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Release ), which shall be incorporated by reference
 into this Agreement and become a part hereof, within sixty (60) days of Executive s termination of employment, which has (and not until it has) become irrevocable, releasing NBTB, NBT Bank, and any of their affiliates, and their directors,
 officers, and employees, from any and all claims or potential claims arising from or related to Executive s employment with NBTB, NBT Bank, or any of their affiliates or Executive s termination of employment. If the Release is executed and
 delivered and no longer subject to revocation as provided in the preceding sentence, payments or benefits shall commence upon the first scheduled payment date immediately after the date the Release is executed and no longer subject to revocation
 (the Release Effective Date ). The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this Agreement applied as though such payments
 commenced immediately upon Executive s Termination Date, and any payments made thereafter shall continue as provided herein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced
 immediately following Executive s Termination Date. 

- 11 - 

The Company may provide, in its sole discretion, that Executive may continue to participate in any benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 6(d) during the period of such delay, provided
 that Executive shall bear the full cost of such benefits during such delay period. Upon the date such benefits would otherwise commence pursuant to this Section 6(d) , the Company may reimburse Executive the Company s share of the cost of
 such benefits, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, in each case had such benefits commenced
 immediately upon Executive s Termination Date. Any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the schedule and procedures specified herein.

(e) No Mitigation . Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment
 provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor, except as expressly set forth in Section 6(c)(i)(B) of this Agreement, shall
 the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned or benefits received by Executive as the result of employment by another employer after the Termination Date or otherwise.

 such termination were for Cause, to the extent required by the applicable federal or state statue related to banking, deposit insurance, or bank or savings institution holding companies, or by regulations or orders issued by the Office of the
 Controller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other state or federal banking regulatory agency having jurisdiction over NBTB or NBT Bank, and no payment shall be required to be made to or for the benefit of Executive
 under this Agreement to the extent such payment is prohibited by applicable law, regulation, or order issued by a banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, that it shall be the Company s burden to prove that any such action was
 so required.

- 12 - 

7. Maximization of After-Tax Amounts . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event any payments or
 benefits Executive becomes entitled to pursuant to this Agreement or any other payments or benefits received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control or termination of employment (whether pursuant to the terms of any
 other agreement, plan, or arrangement, or otherwise, with the Company, any Person whose actions result in a Change in Control, or any affiliate of the Company or such Person) (collectively the Payments will be subject to the tax (the Excise

Tax imposed by Code Section 4999, the payments or benefits due under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Payments will not result in the imposition of such Excise Tax. The Payment reduction contemplated by the preceding sentence
 shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G Section 280G ), and then reducing the parachute payments in order beginning with
 the parachute payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio. For parachute payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such parachute payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such parachute payments with amounts
 having later payment dates being reduced first. For parachute payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such parachute payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing
 parachute payments with a lower Parachute Payment Ratio. For purposes hereof, the term Parachute Payment Ratio shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the applicable parachute payment for purposes of Section
 280G and the denominator of which is the intrinsic value of such parachute payment. For purposes of determining whether any of the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) the entire amount of the
 Payments shall be treated as parachute payments within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) and as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and to the extent, in the written opinion of the Company s independent accountants and as reasonably
 acceptable to Executive, such payments (in whole or in part) are not subject to the Excise Tax; and (ii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit (constituting a part of the Payments) shall be determined by the
 Company s independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Code Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Payments exceed three (3) times Executive s base amount as defined within Section 280G and (ii)
 Executive would receive at least 50,000 more on a net after-tax basis if his Payments were not reduced pursuant to this Section 7 (after Executive s
 payment of the Excise Tax), then the Company will not reduce the Payments to Executive, and Executive shall be responsible for the Excise Tax related thereto. For purposes of determining the net after-tax benefit, Executive shall be deemed to
 pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of the federal income taxation applicable to individuals (without taking into account surtaxes or loss or reduction of deductions) for the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs
 and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of taxation in the state and locality of your residence on the Termination Date. 

8. Representations and Warranties .

(a) Executive represents and warrants to the Company that his execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement will not result in or constitute a breach of or conflict with any term,
 covenant, condition, or provision of any commitment, contract, or other agreement or instrument, including, without limitation, any other employment agreement, to which Executive is or has been a party.

(b) Executive shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company for, from, and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, expenses, or liabilities, including court costs and

 warranty of Executive in Section 8(a) hereof to be true and correct when made.

 writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge, or termination is sought. No waiver, by either party hereto at any time, of any breach by the other party hereto or of compliance with any condition or provision of this

(ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provisions held
 to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

14. 409A Compliance .

(a) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to
 the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall NBTB, NBT Bank, or any of their directors, officers, employees, or agents be liable for any additional tax, interest, or
 penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that
 constitutes deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset, counterclaim, or recoupment by any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A. For purposes of Code Section 409A,
 Executive s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.

(b) Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary, if Executive is deemed on the Termination Date a specified employee within the meaning of that term under
 Code Section 409A, then each of the following shall apply:

(i) With regard to any payment that is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable on account of a separation from service, such payment shall be made on the date
 which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Executive s separation from service, and (B) the date of Executive s death (the Delay Period ), to the extent required under Code Section
 409A. Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section 14 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid to Executive in
 a lump sum, and all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein; and

(ii) To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period are considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A provided on account of a separation from
 service, and such benefits are not otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A, Executive shall pay the cost of such benefits during the Delay Period, and the Company shall reimburse Executive, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been
 paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, the Company s share of the cost of such benefits upon expiration of the Delay Period, and any remaining benefits
 shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the procedures specified herein.

- 16 - 

15. Arbitration . Subject to the right of each party to seek specific performance (which right shall not be subject to arbitration) and
 to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief in connection with or by reason of a breach or threatened breach of Section 4 (where the party has elected not to pursue such relief in arbitration pursuant to this Section 15 , if a dispute arises out of or is in any way related to this Agreement or the asserted breach thereof, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration before the American Arbitration
 Association the AAA pursuant to the AAA s National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (the Arbitration Rules ). A dispute subject to the provisions of this Section 15 will exist if either party notifies the other party in writing that a dispute subject to arbitration exists and states, with reasonable specificity, the issue subject to arbitration (the Arbitration Notice ). 
 The parties agree that, after the issuance of the Arbitration Notice, the parties will try in good faith between the date of the issuance of the Arbitration Notice and the date the dispute is set for arbitration to resolve the dispute by
 mediation in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. If the dispute is not resolved by the date set for arbitration, then any controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement or the asserted breach hereof shall be resolved by binding
 arbitration and judgment upon any award rendered by arbitrator(s) may be entered in a court having jurisdiction. In the event any claim or dispute involves an amount in excess of 100,000, either party may request that the matter be heard and
 resolved by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the same power to compel the attendance of witnesses and to order the production of documents or other materials and to enforce discovery as could be exercised by a United States
 District Court judge sitting in Chenango County, New York. In the event of any arbitration, each party shall have a reasonable right to conduct discovery to the same extent permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that
 discovery shall be concluded within ninety (90) days after the date the matter is set for arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall have the power to award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party. Any provisions in this
 Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Section 15 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and the parties have entered into this
 Agreement pursuant to such act. 

16. Costs of Litigation . In the event litigation is commenced to enforce any of the provisions hereof, or to obtain declaratory relief in connection with any of the provisions
 hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees. In the event this Agreement is asserted in any litigation as a defense to any liability, claim, demand, action, cause of action, or right asserted in such
 litigation, the party prevailing on the issue of that defense shall be entitled to recovery of reasonable attorneys fees.

17. Company Right to Recover . If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company as a result of misconduct, with
 regard to any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and Executive is subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Executive knowingly engaged in the misconduct, was grossly negligent
 in engaging in the misconduct, knowingly failed to prevent the misconduct, or was grossly negligent in failing to prevent the misconduct, Executive shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment earned or accrued during the twelve (12)-month
 period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document that contained such material noncompliance.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, Executive will forfeit any payments made based on the achievement of pre-established
 performance goals that are later determined, as a result of the accounting restatement, not to have been achieved.

To the extent that any payment is made to Executive pursuant to this Agreement and information later becomes available that would have led to supervisory disapproval of the payment, then the
 Company and its successors expressly reserve the right to suspend or deny full allocation of all remaining payments and/or compel repayment of any or all dispersed payments, should later information warrant such action. Subsequent information
 which would lead to the exercise of these rights would include, without limitation, any information indicating that Executive has committed, is substantially responsible for, or has violated the respective acts or omissions, conditions, or offenses
 outlined in 12 C.F.R. section 359.4(a)(4).

- 17 - 

18. Cooperation . The parties agree that certain matters in which Executive will be involved during the Term of Employment may necessitate Executive s cooperation in the future.
 Accordingly, following the termination of Executive s employment for any reason, to the extent reasonably requested by the Board, Executive shall cooperate with the Company in connection with matters arising out of Executive s service to the
 Company; provided, that the Company shall make reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Executive s other activities. The Company shall reimburse Executive for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation and, to the extent
 that Executive is required to spend substantial time on such matters, the Company shall compensate the Executive at an hourly rate based on Executive s Base Salary on the Termination Date or at another mutually agreed upon rate.

19. Affiliation . A company will be deemed to be an affiliate of, or affiliated with NBTB or NBT Bank according to the definition of Affiliate set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the
 General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act.

20. Headings . The section and subsection headings herein have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions
 hereof.

21. Survival . Sections 4, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 Executive ), dated May___, 2022 (the Employment Agreement ), into which this Separation Agreement and Release Separation Agreement is incorporated by reference, Executive, on behalf of himself and his agents, heirs, executors,

 entities, agents and employees, and the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of all of the foregoing (collectively, Releasee ), from or in connection with, and Executive hereby waives and/or settles, with prejudice, any and all
 complaints, causes of action, suits, controversies, or any liability, claims, demands, or damages, known or unknown and of any nature whatsoever and which Executive ever had, now has or shall or may have as of the date of this Separation Agreement,
 including without limitation, those arising directly or indirectly pursuant to or out of any aspect of Executive s employment or termination from employment with NBTB, NBT Bank or any other Releasee.

II. Specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, and except as to the enforcement of this Separation Agreement and any rights which cannot be waived as a matter of law, the release and waiver of
 claims under this Separation Agreement shall include and apply to any rights and/or claims (i) arising under any contract or employment arrangement, express or implied, written or oral; (ii) for wrongful dismissal or termination of employment;
 (iii) arising under any applicable federal, state, local or other statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations or the like, or case law, that relate to employment or employment practices and/or specifically, that prohibit discrimination based upon age,
 race, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information or any other unlawful bases, including without limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in
 Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Executive
 Order 11246, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, the New York Labor Law, all as amended, and any other statutes, orders, laws, ordinances, regulations
 applicable to Employee s employment, of any state or city in which any Releasee is subject to jurisdiction, and/or any political subdivision thereof; (iv) based upon any other federal, state or local statutes, orders, laws, ordinances, regulations,
 case law, public policy, or common law or the like; (v) concerning recruitment, hiring, discharge, promotions, transfers, employment status, right to reemployment, wages, bonus or incentive pay, severance pay, stock or stock options, employment
 benefits (including, without limitation, sick or other leave, medical, disability, life, or any other insurance, 401(k), pension, other retirement plans or benefits, or any other fringe benefits), workers compensation, intentional or negligent
 misrepresentation and/or infliction of emotional distress, interference with contract, fraud, libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy or loss of consortium, together with any and all tort, contract, or other claims which have been or might
 have been asserted by Executive or on his behalf in any suit, charge of discrimination, or claim against the Releasee; and (vi) for damages, including without limitation, punitive or compensatory damages, or for attorneys fees, expenses, costs,
 wages, injunctive or equitable relief.

III. Executive expressly understands and acknowledges that it is possible that unknown losses or claims exist or that present losses may have been underestimated in amount or severity, and Executive
 explicitly took that into account in determining the amount of consideration to be paid for the giving of the release in this Separation Agreement, and a portion of said consideration and the mutual covenants were given in exchange for a full
 satisfaction and discharge of such claims.

IV. Executive and NBT Bank acknowledge that the above release and waiver of claims shall not apply to the obligation of NBT Bank to make payments (if any) of any vested benefit under NBT Bank s tax-qualified
 employee benefit plans nor to Executive s right to continue healthcare insurance under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

V. Executive represents and warrants that he has not filed or commenced any complaints, claims, actions or proceeding of any kind against any Releasee with any federal, state or local court or any
 administrative or regulatory body. Executive agrees not to commence or participate as a party in any proceeding in any court or forum against any Releasee which is based upon any act, omission or occurrence up to and including the date of the
 execution of this Separation Agreement. Executive further agrees not to encourage or participate in any action or proceeding brought by any person (except a government agency) against any Releasee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Separation
 Agreement does not affect Executive s right to file a charge or complaint with any state, local or federal agency or to participate or cooperate in such a matter. However, Executive acknowledges that he is not entitled to monetary damages
 resulting from any such actions. Executive acknowledges and agrees that while this Separation Agreement sets forth a broad release under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the New York State Human Rights Law, as amended, and
 any other federal, state, or local law that prohibits sexual harassment, Executive has never asserted a claim for sexual harassment and has no such claim against NBTB, NBT Bank or any other Releasee as of the date of this Separation Agreement.
 Executive further acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the separation payments under the Employment Agreement that Executive is receiving under the terms of the Employment Agreement, if any, relates in any way to a claim for sexual
 harassment.

VI. This Separation Agreement is not and shall not be construed as an admission by any Releasee or Executive of any wrongdoing or illegal acts or omissions, and each party expressly denies that they engaged
 in any wrongdoing or illegal or acts or omissions. Executive shall not, except as may be required by law, make any oral or written negative, disparaging or adverse statements, suggestions, or representations of or concerning NBT Bank or any
 Releasee.

VII. Executive agrees to cooperate reasonably with and to be readily available to NBT Bank to assist in any matter, including government agency investigations, court litigation or potential litigation, about
 which Executive may have knowledge. If Executive receives a subpoena or other legal process relating in any way to same, Executive immediately will provide NBT Bank notice of the contact or the service of such subpoena or other legal process, and
 shall cooperate with NBT Bank in responding.

VIII. Except as prohibited by law, each Releasee shall be excused from any obligation to make payment of the separation payments in the Employment Agreement in the event that paragraphs I through IV of this
 Separation Agreement are determined to be void or unenforceable, in whole or in part; or Executive is found to have made a material misstatement in any term, condition, representation or acknowledgement in this Separation Agreement, in either of
 which event Executive shall also be liable for any damages and costs suffered or incurred by any Releasee by reason of such misstatement or breach.

IX. This Separation Agreement shall be incorporated by reference into the Employment Agreement and shall be made a part thereof.

X. Executive agrees and acknowledges that:

 Agreement. It is not necessary that any Releasee sign this Separation Agreement following Executive s full and complete execution of it for it to become fully effective and enforceable;

 unknown, foreseen or unforeseen claims presently asserted or otherwise arising through the date of his signing of this Separation Agreement that he may have against any Releasee.

XI. Executive understands all of the terms of this Separation Agreement, and agrees that such terms are fair, reasonable and are not the result of any fraud, duress, coercion, pressure or undue influence
 exercised by or on behalf of any Releasee; and Executive has agreed to and entered into this Separation Agreement and all of its terms, knowingly, freely and voluntarily.

XII. There are no other agreements of any nature between any Releasee and Executive with respect to the matters discussed in this Separation Agreement, except as expressly stated herein, and in signing this
