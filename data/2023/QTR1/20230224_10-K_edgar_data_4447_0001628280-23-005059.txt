PART I 
 
 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 
 Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global E P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block. We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. 
 Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation s approximate 41 consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. See Midstream on page 11 . 
 Exploration and Production 
 Proved Reserves 
 Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, and exclude escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were 94.13 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (2021: 66.34) and 97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: 68.92). Our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at December 31 were as follows:

 E P Operations 
 At December 31, 2022, our significant E P assets included the following: 
 United States 
 Our production in the U.S. was from the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota (Bakken) and from offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 North Dakota: 
 Bakken: At December 31, 2022, we held approximately 466,000 net acres in the Bakken. Net production averaged 154,000 boepd in 2022. We drilled 78 wells and brought 69 wells on production in 2022, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,664 at December 31, 2022. Prior to COVID-19, we were operating six rigs in the Bakken, but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline in crude oil prices. We added a second operated rig in the Bakken in February 2021, a third operated rig in September 2021, and a fourth operated rig in July 2022. During 2023, we plan to operate four rigs, drill approximately 110 wells and bring approximately 110 wells on production. 
 Offshore: 
 Gulf of Mexico: At December 31, 2022, we held approximately 44,000 net developed acres, with our production operations principally at the Baldpate (Hess 50 ), Conger (Hess 38 ), Llano (Hess 50 ), Penn State (Hess 50 ), Stampede (Hess 25 and Tubular Bells (Hess 57 Fields. At December 31, 2022, we held approximately 249,000 net undeveloped acres, of which leases covering approximately 172,000 acres are due to expire in the next three years. In 2022, we completed drilling operations on the Huron-1 exploration well located on Green Canyon Block 69 (Hess 40 ), where oil bearing reservoirs were encountered. Well results are being evaluated and an appraisal sidetrack is planned. In 2023, we plan to participate in four wells which include two exploration wells, and two wells that will be tie-backs to the Stampede Field and Llano Field production platforms. 
 7 

Guyana 
 Stabroek Block: The Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, covers approximately 6.6 million acres. The operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, has made more than 30 discoveries since 2015, with the discovered resources to date on the block expected to underpin the potential for up to ten FPSOs. The first six FPSOs are expected to have an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd in 2027. 
 The Liza Phase 1 development began producing oil in December 2019 utilizing the Liza Destiny FPSO and in June 2022 reached its expanded production capacity of more than 140,000 gross bopd from approximately 120,000 gross bopd following the completion of production optimization work. The Liza Phase 2 development, which began producing oil in February 2022 from the Liza Unity FPSO, reached its expected production capacity of 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022. 
 The third development, Payara, was sanctioned in 2020 and will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have an expected production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by the end of 2023. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. 
 A fourth development, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 and will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with an expected production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2025. Six drill centers are planned with up to 26 production wells and 25 injection wells. 
 A fifth development, Uaru, was submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2022. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first oil anticipated at the end of 2026. 
 In 2022, the operator drilled a total of ten successful exploration and appraisal wells that encountered hydrocarbons and one unsuccessful exploration well, Banjo-1, for which the well costs were expensed. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the operator completed one successful exploration well that encountered hydrocarbons, and one unsuccessful exploration well, Fish/Tarpon-1, for which well costs incurred through December 31, 2022 were expensed. See Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 In 2023, the operator plans to utilize six drillships to drill approximately ten exploration and appraisal wells in addition to development wells for the sanctioned developments. 
 Kaieteur Block: We hold a 20 participating interest in the Kaieteur Block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block. Seismic evaluation and planning for the next exploration well are ongoing. 
 Malaysia and JDA 
 Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA): Production comes from the Carigali Hess operated Block A-18 in the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50 ). In 2023, the operator plans to drill approximately eight development wells. 
 Malaysia: Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM302 (Hess 50 located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia and Block PM301 (Hess 50 ), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A 18 of the JDA. In 2023, we plan to continue development activities at NMB, including drilling approximately ten wells. 
 Other 
 Suriname: We hold a 33 non-operated participating interest in Block 42, offshore Suriname. In 2022, the operator, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, drilled the Zanderij-1 exploration well. The well encountered oil pay and demonstrated a working petroleum system. Well results continue to be evaluated. The operator plans to drill one exploration well in 2024. We also hold a 33 non-operated participating interest in Block 59, offshore Suriname, where the operator, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Suriname B.V., is processing recently acquired 3D seismic data. 
 Canada: We hold a 25 non-operated participating interest in two exploration licenses offshore Newfoundland. In 2023, the operator, BP Canada, plans to drill one exploration well. 
 Sales Commitments 
 We have certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and NGL production. At the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 30 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027. At the North Malay Basin development project offshore Peninsular Malaysia, we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 55 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2024. The estimated total volume of natural gas subject to these sales commitments is approximately 395 billion cubic 
 8 

feet. We also have multiple minimum delivery commitments in the Bakken for natural gas and NGL with various end dates through 2032, with total commitments of approximately 125 million boe over the remaining life of the contracts. 
 We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments, and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves, as well as projected third-party supply in the case of NGL.

 Midstream 
 Prior to December 16, 2019, the Midstream segment was primarily comprised of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers. HIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50 of HIP to GIP for approximately 2.6 billion on July 1, 2015. 
 On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5 limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately 365.5 million. In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20 controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100 economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the Contributed Businesses ). In exchange for the Contributed Businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75 limited partner interest in Hess Midstream Partners and a 50 indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners general partner, which had a 2 economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights. 
 On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP s 80 interest in Hess Midstream Partners oil and gas midstream assets, HIP s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners. In addition, Hess Midstream Partners organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an Up-C structure in which Hess Midstream Partners public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to Hess Midstream Operations LP (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity. As consideration for the acquisition, Hess received a cash payment of 301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units. After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream owned 6 of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each owned 47 of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis. 
 In March 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of 6.9 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of 6.9 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. In August 2021, HESM Opco repurchased 31.25 million Class B units held by Hess and GIP for 750 million. Hess received net proceeds of 375 million. HESM Opco issued 750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase. In October 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 8.6 million Class A Shares held by Hess and GIP. These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of approximately 8.6 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. 
 In April 2022, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 10.2 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. The Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of approximately 10.2 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. Concurrent with the April 2022 public offering, HESM Opco repurchased approximately 13.6 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP for 400 million. HESM Opco issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase. 
 After giving effect to the above transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares of Hess Midstream own approximately 18 , and Hess and GIP each own approximately 41 , of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis at December 31, 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, Midstream assets included the following: 
 Natural Gas Gathering and Compression: A natural gas gathering and compression system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Tioga Gas

 Johnson s Corner Header System: A crude oil pipeline header system located in McKenzie County, North Dakota that receives crude oil by pipeline from Hess and third parties and delivers crude oil to third-party interstate pipeline systems. The facility has a delivery capacity of approximately 100,000 bopd of crude oil. 
 Produced Water Gathering and Disposal: A produced water gathering system located primarily in Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota, that transports produced water from the wellsite by approximately 290 miles of pipeline in gathering systems or by third-party trucking to water handling facilities for disposal. 
 Hess Midstream has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements effective January 1, 2014 with certain subsidiaries of Hess for gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage services, and terminal and export services, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes that the Hess subsidiaries are obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E P segment s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage services, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options. Hess Midstream also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services effective January 1, 2019 with a subsidiary of Hess, with an initial 14 year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees. 
 Competition and Market Conditions 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions. 
 Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures 
 We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities. These plans are maintained, 
 12 

reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability. Where applicable, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities. 
 Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans. Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented. 
 To complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations, we maintain membership contracts with a network of local, regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations. At the regional and global level, these organizations include CGA, MSRC, MWCC, WWC and OSRL. CGA and MSRC are domestic spill response organizations and MWCC provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. WWC provides firefighting, well control and engineering services globally. OSRL is a global response organization and is available, when needed, to assist us with any of our assets. In addition to owning response assets in their own right, the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required. OSRL s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 600,000 feet of boom, nine capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment, including aircraft. In addition to external well control and oil spill response support, we have contracts with wildlife, environmental, meteorology, incident management, medical and security resources. If we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services, we would fund such services and, where appropriate, seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage, as described below. In certain circumstances, we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support. We maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the Executive Committee and Response Network Committee of MWCC, the Technical Operations Committee of CGA and the Oil Spill and Emergency Response Committee of API. We also maintain regular voting membership in CGA, MSRC and OSRL. 
 We continue to participate in several industry-wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods. The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes. 
 Insurance Coverage and Indemnification 
 We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage. This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. 
 The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding windstorm coverage for which we are self-insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss. In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance. The first 450 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group. Above this 450 million threshold, additional insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 540 million in total at December 31, 2022, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above. The insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our E P operations. Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to 850 million, which coverage under a standard JOA would be reduced to our participating interest. Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year. Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable. 
 Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault. Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Third-party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis. 
 We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the contractor against, all claims including those from third parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractor s property. Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party. Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third-party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist. Lastly, some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the 
 13 

contractor s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount. Variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap. 
 Under a standard JOA, each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator). Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable. The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions. Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several. 
 Government Regulations 
 The crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels. Regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under continuous review for amendment or expansion over time, which may result in incremental costs of doing business and affect our profitability. See Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors . Compliance with various existing environmental, health and safety regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products. We spent approximately 23 million in 2022 for environmental remediation. Additionally, we may be exposed to decommissioning liabilities, including for divested assets. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. For further discussion of environmental, health and safety regulations affecting our business, see Environment, Health and Safety in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .

 Hess DEI Council provides executive leadership guidance to embed DEI into our culture and drive progress throughout the organization. Our expectations for a culture fostering mutual respect and trust are spelled out in our Code of Conduct and Ethics and related policies. It is also reinforced regularly with employees at every level of our Corporation through regular communication and ongoing training. Additional information about our policies and practices, including training, employee engagement initiatives and workforce data, is included in our annual Sustainability Report and annual U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity reporting, which is available on our website at www.hess.com. 
 During 2022, Hess maintained or improved diversity across most levels of our workforce. Our strategic focus on DEI, including our talent practices and diversity outreach programs, contributed to this outcome. Our DEI leader helps to develop a tailored, long-term strategy that defines our objectives and strategies to advance DEI now and in the future. We also have six employee resource groups that provide valuable employee insights to sustain a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone to thrive and perform at their best.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. 
 Market and Third-Party Risks 
 Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas; political conditions and events (including weather, instability, changes in governments, armed conflict, economic sanctions and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, NGL and natural gas; the price, availability of and demand for alternative fuels or other forms of energy; the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts; and overall economic conditions globally (including inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, supply chain constraints, and consequences associated with the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia). The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Average benchmark prices for 2022 were 94.33 per barrel for WTI (2021: 68.08; 2020: 39.34) and 99.04 per barrel for Brent (2021: 70.95; 2020: 43.21). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. Furthermore, from time to time we have entered into, and may in the future enter into or modify, commodity price hedging arrangements to manage commodity price volatility. These arrangements may limit potential upside from commodity price increases, or expose us to additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk, which could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. 
 We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. For example, in June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood) which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to us and other predecessors in title of certain of its assets, who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . As a result, actions of our contractual counterparties may adversely affect the value of our investments and result in increased costs or liabilities. 
 Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future, could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets, or may have established strategic relationships in areas we operate, or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to incur. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets, which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location. 
 Our business and operations were and could in the future be adversely affected by an epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19 or other similar public health developments. We face risks related to epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events, or the threat thereof, that are outside of our control, and could significantly disrupt our business and operational plans and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, COVID-19 and related actions taken by governments and businesses, including voluntary and mandatory quarantines and travel and other restrictions, significantly impacted economic activity. As a result of COVID-19, our operations, and those of our business partners, service companies and suppliers, have experienced disruptions, delays or temporary suspensions of operations, temporary inaccessibility or closures of facilities, supply chain issues and workforce impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures. We also are subject to regulatory changes, litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements. Furthermore, there is no certainty that the health and safety measures we 
 18 

implement will be sufficient to mitigate the risks, including infection of key employees and our ability to perform certain functions, posed by COVID-19, its variants or another epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease. 
 In addition to the global health concerns, an epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could negatively affect the U.S. and global economy and the demand for oil and natural gas. For example, COVID-19 and concerns regarding the global spread of its variants negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas and contributed to price volatility and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. Containment measures implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants lead to adoption of certain behavioral changes, such as reduced travel and enhanced work-from-home policies, which resulted in further reductions in demand for and consumption of energy commodities. We may experience decreases in production and proved reserves, additional asset impairments, and other accounting charges if demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL decreases as a result of a future or worsening outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants. The extent to which such an occurrence may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain and depends on actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. 
 Operational and Strategic Risks 
 If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition, replacing reserves and developing future production are also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices may reduce capital available for our exploration and development activities, render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion, and result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. 
 There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, changes in prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. 
 Catastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including catastrophic events, which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations, result in personal injury and have other significant adverse effects. These events include unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations, equipment malfunctions or failures, derailments, fires, explosions, blowouts, oil releases, power outages, cratering, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, such as hurricanes, floods, freezes and heat waves or droughts, geological events, shortages in availability of skilled labor, cyber-attacks or health measures related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. Some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. For example, we are self-insured against physical damage to property and liability related to windstorms. In 2022, there was no significant hurricane-related downtime whereas in 2021, hurricane-related downtime reduced net production by 4,000 boepd and hurricane related maintenance and repair costs were approximately 7 million. In addition, the frequency and severity of weather conditions and other meteorological phenomena, including storms, droughts, extreme temperatures, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that impact our business activities, may also be impacted by the effects of climate change. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate change. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand or create operational challenges. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in 
 19 

receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, services or resources, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions, equipment failures, and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. 
 An inability to secure personnel, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E P industry. Concerns over global economic conditions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and other factors, each of which are beyond our control, contribute to increased economic uncertainty for us and our suppliers. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost, which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. In addition, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. An inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business. 
 Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration, development and production activities and the activities of our business partners. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices in response to COVID-19. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, any such disruption, failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. 
 Financial Risks 
 We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. All three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, rising interest rates, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy. 
 We engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a 
 20 

hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. 
 Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks 
 Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations, solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties. 
 Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. 
 Climate change, sustainability and other ESG initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of GHGs from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA includes a methane emissions reduction program for petroleum and natural gas systems, which requires the EPA to impose a waste emissions charge on excess methane emissions from certain natural gas and oil sources that are required to report under EPA s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program beginning January 1, 2024 and also provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of competing low carbon energy production methods. In addition, such legislation, regulations and initiatives could impact demand as our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of GHGs. 
 We are prioritizing sustainable energy practices to further reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time remaining a successful operating public company. However, various key stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others, may have differing approaches to climate change initiatives. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholders' trust and thereby affect our reputation. Shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry, and stockholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. We continue to focus on developing our ESG practices, and as voluntary and regulatory ESG disclosure standards and policies continue to evolve, we have expanded and expect to further expand our public disclosures in these areas. Such disclosures may reflect aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions, including over long timelines, which aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates, and other expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized. Failure to realize or timely achieve progress on such aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates, and other expectations or assumptions may adversely impact us. 
 Furthermore, as a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of petroleum fuels, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent GHG emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. Increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require us to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm. 
 We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Political or regulatory developments and governmental actions, including federal, state, local, territorial and foreign 
 21 

laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted, which may affect our financial results. These actions could result in tax increases retroactively through tax claims or prospectively through changes to applicable statutory tax rates, modification of the tax base, or imposition of new tax types. For example, the IRA includes a 15 book-income alternative minimum tax on corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over 1 billion for any three year period ending with 2022 or later and a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock that is repurchased by publicly traded U.S. corporations effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The impact of the excise tax provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We continue to evaluate the corporate alternative minimum tax and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate, as well as any other impacts the IRA may have on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Additionally, governmental actions could include post-production deductions from royalty payments; limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new oil and gas leases or extensions on existing oil and gas leases; adverse court decisions with respect to the sale of new and existing oil and gas leases; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; the imposition of tariffs; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. In recent years, proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm. Costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Political instability globally and in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Political instability and civil unrest have affected and may continue to affect the oil and gas markets generally. Some international areas are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability in areas where we operate may expose our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 has led to disruption, instability, and volatility in global markets and industries, including the oil and gas markets. The U.S. government and other foreign governments imposed severe economic sanctions and export controls against Russia, certain regions of Ukraine and particular entities and individuals, and may impose additional sanctions and controls. To date, we have not experienced a material impact to operations or the consolidated financial statements as a result of the invasion of Ukraine; however, we will continue to monitor for events that could materially impact us or our industry. Furthermore, the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. 
 One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Hess Midstream LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities . Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our stockholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs.

Overview 
 Hess Corporation is a global E P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States, Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block. We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. 
 Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation s approximate 41 consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022 , provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. 
 Climate Change, Energy Transition and Our Strategy 
 We believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time meeting the growing demand for affordable and secure energy, which is essential to ensure a just and orderly energy transition that aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The IEA's 2022 World Energy Outlook provides three scenarios of global energy demand in 2040 based on varying levels of global response to climate change. Under all of the IEA scenarios, oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that significant investment will be required to meet the world s projected growing energy needs, both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas. 
 Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Our strategy aligns with the energy transition needed to reach the energy-related Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Our commitment to sustainability starts with our Board of Directors and senior management and is reinforced throughout our organization. Our Board of Directors, led by its Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, is actively engaged in overseeing Hess sustainability practices so that sustainability risks and opportunities are taken into account when making strategic decisions. Our Board s Compensation and Management Development Committee has tied executive compensation to advancing our environmental, health and safety goals. We also have an executive led task force to guide our medium and longer term climate strategy. 
 We have five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 50 and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50 , both from 2017 levels. In January 2022, we announced our plan to reduce routine flaring at Hess operated assets to zero by the end of 2025. In December 2022, we announced an agreement with the Government of Guyana to purchase 37.5 million REDD+ carbon credits, including current and future issuances, for a minimum of 750 million from 2022 through 2032 to prevent deforestation and support sustainable development in Guyana. This agreement adds to the Corporation's ongoing emissions reduction efforts and is an important part of our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis by 2050. 
 
 25 

Our business planning includes actions we expect to undertake to continue reducing our carbon footprint consistent with our targets. We also conduct annual scenario planning as a methodology to assess our portfolio s resilience to differing scenarios of energy supply and demand over the longer term, and to inform our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand, energy mix, the emergence of new technologies, and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. 
 2022 Return of Capital Highlights and 2023 Outlook 
 Following the startup of the Liza Phase 2 project in February 2022, we repaid the remaining 500 million outstanding under our 1.0 billion term loan, and in March 2022, we announced a 50 increase to our quarterly dividend on common stock. In 2022, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock for 650 million. 
 Our E P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately 3.7 billion in 2023, up from 2.7 billion in 2022. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately 225 million, compared with 232 million in 2022. Oil and gas net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd, up from 327,000 boepd in 2022, pro forma for assets sold. For 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of 70 per barrel, and 10,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 75 per barrel. 
 Consolidated Results 
 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation was 2,096 million in 2022 compared with 559 million in 2021. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 29 , adjusted net income was 2,176 million in 2022 compared with 677 million in 2021. Net production averaged 344,000 boepd in 2022 and 315,000 boepd in 2021. The average realized crude oil price, including the effect of hedging, was 85.76 per barrel in 2022 and 60.08 per barrel in 2021. Total proved reserves were 1,256 million boe and 1,309 million boe at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Significant 2022 Activities 
 The following is an update of significant E P activities during 2022: 
 E P assets: 
 In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 154,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 156,000 boepd). Net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to unplanned production shut-ins caused by severe winter weather partially offset by increased wells on-line. We drilled 78 wells and brought 69 wells on production in 2022, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,664 at December 31, 2022. Prior to COVID-19, we were operating six rigs in the Bakken, but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline in crude oil prices. We added a second operated rig in the Bakken in February 2021, a third operated rig in September 2021 and a fourth operated rig in July 2022. During 2023, we plan to operate four rigs, drill approximately 110 wells and bring approximately 110 wells on production. We forecast net production from the Bakken to be in the range of 165,000 boepd to 170,000 boepd in 2023 . 
 In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 31,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 45,000 boepd). Net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells, Penn State and Llano Fields. For 2023, net production from the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be approximately 30,000 boepd. 
 At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 ), offshore Guyana, net production from the Liza Destiny and Unity FPSOs totaled 78,000 bopd in 2022 (2021: 30,000 bopd). The Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022, reached its production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, we used the remainder of our previously generated Guyana net operating loss carryforwards and started incurring a current income tax liability. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements of the petroleum agreement, a portion of gross production from the block, separate from the joint venture partners' (Co-Venturers) cost oil and profit oil entitlement, is used to satisfy the Co-Venturers income tax liability. This portion of gross production, referred to as tax barrels, is recognized as Co-Venturer production volumes and estimated proved reserves. Net production from Guyana in 2022 included 7,000 bopd of tax barrels (2021: 0 bopd). For 2023, we forecast net production to be approximately 100,000 bopd, which includes approximately 10,000 bopd of tax barrels. 
 The third development, Payara, was sanctioned in 2020 and will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have an expected production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by the end of 2023. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. 
 A fourth development, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 and will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with an expected production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2025. Six drill centers are planned with up to 26 production wells and 25 injection wells. 
 26 

A fifth development, Uaru, was submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2022. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first oil anticipated at the end of 2026. In addition to the first five developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and order of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling. 
 In 2022, the operator drilled a total of ten successful exploration and appraisal wells that encountered hydrocarbons and one unsuccessful exploration well, Banjo-1, for which the well costs were expensed. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the operator completed one successful exploration well that encountered hydrocarbons, and one unsuccessful exploration well, Fish/Tarpon-1, for which well costs incurred through December 31, 2022 were expensed. See Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 In 2023, the operator plans to utilize six drillships to drill approximately ten exploration and appraisal wells in addition to development wells for the sanctioned developments. 
 In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A 18 of the JDA averaged 38,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 36,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 26,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 25,000 boepd). In 2023, we forecast net production from North Malay Basin and JDA combined to be in the range of 60,000 boepd to 65,000 boepd. 
 In Libya, we completed the sale of our interest in the Waha Concession in November for net proceeds of 150 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of 76 million 76 million after income taxes). Net production from Libya was 17,000 boepd in 2022. 
 The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2022: 
 In April 2022, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 10.2 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. As a result of this transaction, Hess received net proceeds of 146 million. 
 Concurrent with the April 2022 public offering, HESM Opco repurchased approximately 13.6 million Class B units held by Hess and GIP for 400 million, with Hess receiving net proceeds of 200 million. HESM Opco issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase.

 Midstream Capital Expenditures: Midstream Capital Expenditures 232 183 253 
 (a) Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021), and certain non-producing countries. 
 In 2023, we project our E P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 3.7 billion, of which more than 80 will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken, and Midstream capital expenditures to be approximately 225 million. 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Results by Segment: 
 The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production 2,396 770 (2,841) Midstream 269 286 230 Corporate, Interest and Other (569) (497) (482) Total 2,096 559 (3,093) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share Diluted (a) 6.77 1.81 (10.15) 
 (a) Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares. 
 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

 Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures: 
 The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation 2,096 559 (3,093) Less: Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax (80) (118) (2,199) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation 2,176 677 (894) 
 The following table reconciles reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 3,944 2,890 1,333 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 1,177 101 470 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 5,121 2,991 1,803 
 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods, which are summarized on pages 34 through 36 . Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation s operating performance and believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that 
 29 

investors understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods. 
 These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. 
 Comparison of Results 
 Exploration and Production 
 Following is a summarized statement of income for our E P operations: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues 11,324 7,473 4,667 Gains on asset sales, net 76 29 79 Other, net 102 64 31 Total revenues and non-operating income 11,502 7,566 4,777 Costs and Expenses Marketing, including purchased oil and gas 3,394 2,119 1,067 Operating costs and expenses 1,186 965 895 Production and severance taxes 255 172 124 Midstream tariffs 1,193 1,094 946 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 208 162 351 General and administrative expenses 224 191 206 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,520 1,361 1,915 Impairment and other 54 147 2,126 Total costs and expenses 8,034 6,211 7,630 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 3,468 1,355 (2,853) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 1,072 585 (12) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation 2,396 770 (2,841) 
 Excluding the E P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 34 , the changes in E P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, DD A expense, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 
 
 30 

Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 43 higher in 2022 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the increase in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL increased in 2022 by 15 and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2022 by 23 , compared with the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved after-tax results by approximately 1,490 million, compared with 2021. Our average selling prices were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 Average Selling Prices (a) Crude Oil Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States North Dakota 81.06 55.57 42.63 Offshore 81.38 60.09 45.92 Total United States 81.14 56.64 43.56 Guyana 89.86 68.57 46.41 Malaysia and JDA 89.77 71.00 37.91 Other (b) 93.67 66.39 51.37 Worldwide 85.76 60.08 44.28 Crude Oil Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States North Dakota 91.26 59.90 33.87 Offshore 91.51 64.77 36.55 Total United States 91.32 61.05 34.63 Guyana 96.52 71.07 37.40 Malaysia and JDA 89.77 71.00 37.91 Other (b) 101.92 69.25 43.42 Worldwide 94.15 63.90 35.52 Natural Gas Liquids Per Barrel United States North Dakota 35.09 30.74 11.29 Offshore 35.24 26.40 8.94 Worldwide 35.09 30.40 11.10 Natural Gas Per Mcf United States North Dakota 5.50 4.08 1.27 Offshore 6.21 3.25 1.23 Total United States 5.66 3.82 1.26 Malaysia and JDA 5.62 5.15 4.47 Other (b) 5.93 3.40 3.41 Worldwide 5.64 4.60 2.98 
 (a) Selling prices in the United States and Guyana are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses. Excluding these fees worldwide selling prices for 2022 would be 89.50 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging) (2021: 64.25 ; 2020: 47.54), 97.89 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging) (2021: 68.07; 2020: 38.78), 35.44 per barrel for NGL (2021: 30.61; 2020: 11.29) and 5.76 per mcf for natural gas (2021: 4.71; 2020: 3.11). 
 (b) Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021). 
 Crude oil hedging activities in 2022 were a net loss of 585 million before and after income taxes, and a net loss of 243 million before and after income taxes in 2021. For 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of 70 per barrel, and 10,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of 75 per barrel. We expect option premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our results by approximately 30 million in the first quarter and by approximately 140 million for the full year 2023.

Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Crude Oil Barrels United States North Dakota 75 80 107 Offshore (a) 22 29 38 Total United States 97 109 145 Guyana 78 30 20 Malaysia and JDA 4 3 4 Other (b) 15 21 9 Total 194 163 178 Natural Gas Liquids Barrels United States North Dakota 53 49 56 Offshore (a) 2 4 5 Total United States 55 53 61 Natural Gas Mcf United States North Dakota 156 162 180 Offshore (a) 44 72 76 Total United States 200 234 256 Malaysia and JDA 360 347 291 Other (b) 10 10 7 Total 570 591 554 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 344 315 331 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 72 69 72 
 (a) In November 2020, we sold our working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 (b) Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021). Net production from Libya was 17,000 boepd for 2022 (2021: 20,000 boepd; 2020: 4,000 boepd). Net production from Denmark was 3,000 boepd for 2021 and 6,000 boepd for 2020. 
 In 2023, we expect net production to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd , compared with 2022 net production of 327,000 boepd, proforma for assets sold. 
 Net production variances related to 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows: 
 United States: North Dakota net production was lower in 2022 by 2,000 boepd primarily due to unplanned production shut-ins caused by severe winter weather partially offset by increased wells on-line. Total offshore net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells , Penn State, and Llano Fields. 
 International: Net production in Guyana was higher in 2022 primarily due to production ramp up from the Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022 and reached its expected production capacity of 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022. Net production from Guyana included 7,000 bopd of tax barrels in 2022. There were no tax barrels in 2021. 
 
 32 

Sales Volumes: Higher sales volumes in 2022 increased after-tax earnings by approximately 490 million. Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Crude oil barrels (a) 
 69,679 63,540 60,924 Natural gas liquids barrels 
 19,843 19,406 22,397 Natural gas mcf 
 208,001 215,589 202,917 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 124,189 118,878 117,141 Crude oil barrels per day 
 191 174 167 Natural gas liquids barrels per day 
 54 53 61 Natural gas mcf per day 
 570 591 554 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day 340 326 320 
 (a) Sales volumes in 2021 include 4.2 million barrels of crude oil that were stored on VLCCs at December 31, 2020 and sold in the first quarter of 2021. 
 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. and Guyana marketing activities. Marketing expense was higher in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher third party crude oil volumes purchased and higher prices paid for purchased volumes. Marketing expense in 2021 included 173 million related to the cost of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil stored on two VLCCs in 2020 that were sold in 2021. 
 Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E P general and administrative expenses. Cash operating costs increased primarily due to the production ramp up in Guyana from the Liza Unity FPSO, higher production and severance taxes associated with higher crude oil prices, increased maintenance activity in North Dakota, and higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs in 2022 reflect the higher costs partially offset by the impact of the higher production volumes compared with 2021. 
 Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2021, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and minimum volume commitments in 2022. In 2023, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of 1,230 million to 1,250 million. 
 DD A Expense: DD A expense and per-unit rates were higher in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher production from Guyana following the startup of Liza Phase 2 in February 2022. 
 Unit Costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E P net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed on page 34 . Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: 
 Actual Forecast range 2022 2021 2020 2023 Cash operating costs (a) 13.28 11.55 9.91 13.50 14.50 DD A expense (b) 12.13 11.84 15.80 13.00 14.00 Total Production Unit Costs 25.41 23.39 25.71 26.50 28.50 
 (a) Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, were 13.77 in 2022 (2021: 12.11; 2020: 9.85). 
 (b) DD A expense per boe, excluding Libya, was 12.59 in 2022 (2021: 12.43; 2020: 15.98). 
 Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs (a) 56 11 192 Exploration lease impairment 20 20 51 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 132 131 108 208 162 351 
 (a) Dry hole costs primarily related to the Fish/Tarpon-1 well and Banjo-1 well in 2022 and the Koebi-1 well in 2021 at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2020, dry hole costs primarily related to the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana, the Galapagos Deep and Oldfield-1 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and the write-off of previously capitalized exploratory wells (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below). 
 In 2023, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of 160 million to 170 million. 
 33 

Income Taxes: In 2022, E P income tax expense was 1,072 million compared with income tax expense of 585 million in 2021, primarily due to higher pre-tax income in Libya and Guyana. Income tax expense from Libya operations was 527 million in 2022 compared with 436 million in 2021. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream) and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of GAAP. 
 On August 16, 2022 the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15 book-income alternative minimum tax on corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over 1 billion for any 3-year period ending with 2022 or later and a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock that is repurchased by publicly traded U.S. corporations. The alternative minimum tax and the excise tax are effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The alternative minimum tax is designed to be a temporary acceleration of cash tax as amounts paid under such regime are creditable against the regular U.S. corporate income tax liability in following tax years. The impact of the excise tax provision will be reflected as a component of the cost of the repurchased shares and will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We continue to evaluate the corporate alternative minimum tax and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate, as well as any other impacts the IRA may have on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Actual effective tax rates are as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (31) (43) Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a) (19) (15) (5) 
 (a) Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. 
 In 2023, we estimate E P income tax expense, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of 590 million to 600 million. 
 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense): 
 Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Impairment and other (54) (147) (2,126) (54) (147) (2,049) Dry hole and lease impairment expenses (152) (150) Crude oil inventories write-down (53) (52) Severance costs (26) (26) Gains on asset sales, net 76 29 79 76 29 79 22 (118) (2,278) 22 (118) (2,198)

 2021: 
 Gains on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of 29 million 29 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Denmark. 
 Impairment and other: We recorded a charge of 147 million 147 million after income taxes) in connection with estimated abandonment obligations in the West Delta Field in the Gulf of Mexico. These abandonment obligations were assigned to us as a former owner after they were discharged from Fieldwood as part of Fieldwood's approved bankruptcy plan. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 2020: 
 Impairment and other: We recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 2.1 billion 2.0 billion after income taxes) related to our oil and gas properties at North Malay Basin in Malaysia, the South Arne Field in Denmark, and the Stampede and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook.

See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Dry hole and lease impairment expenses: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling 152 million 150 million after income taxes) in the first quarter to write-off previously capitalized exploratory well costs of 125 million 123 million after income taxes) primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico and to impair certain exploration leasehold costs by 27 million 27 million after income taxes) due to a reprioritization of our capital program. 
 Crude oil inventories write-down: We incurred a pre-tax charge of 53 million 52 million after income taxes) to adjust crude oil inventories to their net realizable value at the end of the first quarter following the significant decline in crude oil prices. 
 Severance costs: We recorded a pre-tax charge of 26 million 26 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits incurred related to cost reduction initiatives. 
 Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of 79 million 79 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our 28 working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 
 Midstream 
 Following is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues 1,273 1,204 1,092 Other, net 8 10 10 Total revenues and non-operating income 1,281 1,214 1,102 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 280 289 338 General and administrative expenses 23 22 21 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 181 166 157 Interest expense 150 105 95 Total costs and expenses 634 582 611 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 647 632 491 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 27 15 7 Net income (loss) 620 617 484 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 351 331 254 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation 269 286 230 
 Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2021 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and minimum volume commitments. Operating costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a planned maintenance turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant in 2021, partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenditures on expanded infrastructure in 2022. DD A expense increased from 2021 primarily due to additional assets placed in service. Interest expense increased from 2021 primarily due to the 400 million of 5.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in April 2022 and the 750 million of 4.250 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in August 2021. 
 35 

Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of 255 million to 265 million in 2023. 
 Corporate, Interest and Other 
 The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) 124 121 114 Interest expense 353 376 373 Less: Capitalized interest (10) Interest expense, net 343 376 373 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 467 497 487 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (6) Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 467 497 481 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes 102 1 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes 569 497 482 
 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher legal and professional fees partially offset by higher interest income. Interest expense, net was lower in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the repayment of the Corporation's 1.0 billion term loan, and capitalized interest that commenced upon sanctioning of the Yellowtail development in Guyana in April 2022. 
 In 2023, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of 120 million to 130 million. Interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of 305 million to 315 million in 2023. 
 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense): 
 2022: 
 Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of 22 million 22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of real property related to our former downstream business. 
 Litigation costs: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling 124 million 124 million after income taxes) for litigation related costs associated with our former downstream business, HONX, Inc., which are included in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income . See Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments and Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 2020: 
 Severance costs: We incurred a pre-tax charge of 1 million 1 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits related to cost reduction initiatives.

 The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 
 2022 2021 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents (a) 2,486 2,713 Current portion of long-term debt 3 517 Total debt (b) 8,281 8,458 Total equity 8,496 7,026 Debt to capitalization ratio for debt covenants (c) 36.1 42.3 
 (a) Includes 4 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2022 (2021 : 2 million) of which, 3 million is held by Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022 (2021: 2 million). 
 (b) Includes 2,886 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2022 (2021: 2,564 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 (c) Total Consolidated Debt of Hess Corporation (including finance leases and excluding Midstream non-recourse debt) as a percentage of Total Capitalization of Hess Corporation as defined under Hess Corporation's revolving credit facility financial covenants. Total Capitalization excludes the impact of noncash impairment charges and non-controlling interests. See Note 7, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 3,944 2,890 1,333 Investing activities (2,555) (1,325) (1,707) Financing activities (1,616) (591) 568 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents (227) 974 194 
 Operating Activities : Net cash provided by operating activities was 3,944 million in 2022 (2021: 2,890 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 5,121 million in 2022 (2021: 2,991 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2021 primarily due to higher realized selling prices and higher sales volumes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2022 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by 1,177 million (2021: 101 million) reflecting payments of approximately 470 million for accrued Libyan income tax and royalties at December 31, 2021, premiums paid for crude oil hedge contracts, payments for abandonment activities, and the purchase of REDD+ carbon credits. 
 Investing Activities: Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were 2,725 million in 2022 (2021: 1,747 million). The increase is primarily due to higher drilling and development activities in Guyana, the Bakken, Malaysia and JDA, and the Gulf of Mexico. Proceeds from asset sales were 178 million in 2022 (2021: 427 million). 
 Financing Activities: In 2022, we paid 630 million for settled common stock repurchases (2021: nil) and 465 million for common stock dividends (2021: 311 million). In 2021, we repaid 500 million of our 1 billion term loan, and in 2022, we repaid the remaining 500 million. In 2022, we received net proceeds of 146 million from the public offering of Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP (2021: 178 million). Borrowings in 2022 resulted from the issuance by HESM Opco of 400 million of 5.500 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 while borrowings in 2021 related to the issuance by HESM Opco of 750 million of 4.250 fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030. Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were 510 million in 2022 (2021: 664 million). 
 Future Capital Requirements and Resources 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 2.48 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately 5.7 billion. We plan to return up to 75 of our annual adjusted free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and adjusted for debt repayments and net Midstream financing activities) to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. In March 2022, we announced a 50 increase to our quarterly dividend on common stock, and in 2022, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock for 650 million 20 million was paid subsequent to December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2022, we have fully utilized our Board authorized common stock repurchase program. 
 Net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd , and we expect our 2023 E P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 3.7 billion, up from 2.7 billion in 2022. In 2023, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment and capital return programs . Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.

The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2022: 
 Expiration Date Capacity Borrowings Letters of Credit Issued Total Used Available Capacity (In millions) Hess Corporation Revolving credit facility July 2027 3,250 3,250 Uncommitted lines Various (a) 83 83 83 Total Hess Corporation 3,333 83 83 3,250 Midstream Revolving credit facility (b) July 2027 1,000 18 18 982 Total Midstream 1,000 18 18 982 
 (a) Uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2023. 
 (b) This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 Hess Corporation: 
 In July 2022, we replaced our 3.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in May 2024 with a new 3.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2027. The new facility, which is fully undrawn, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.400 above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. At December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facility. 
 In 2020, we entered into a 1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. Borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an initial applicable margin of 2.25 . In July 2021, we repaid 500 million of the term loan, and in February 2022, we repaid the remaining 500 million. 
 The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65 , and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15 (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility). The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15 . As of December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants. The most restrictive of the financial covenants relating to our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional 2,146 million of secured debt at December 31, 2022. 
 We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. 
 Midstream: 
 In July 2022, HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, amended and restated its credit agreement for its 1.4 billion senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a 1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a 400 million term loan facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2024 to July 2027, increased the accordion feature to up to an additional 750 million, which does not represent a lending commitment from the lenders, and replaced LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings under the term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.650 to 2.550 , while the applicable margin for the syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375 to 2.050 . Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2022, borrowings of 18 million were drawn under HESM Opco s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of 400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 
 38 

Credit Ratings 
 All three major credit rating agencies that rate the senior unsecured debt of Hess Corporation have assigned an investment grade credit rating. In June 2022, Moody s Investors Service upgraded our senior unsecured ratings from Ba1 to Baa3 with a stable outlook. In March 2022, Standard and Poor s Ratings Services affirmed our credit rating at BBB- with stable outlook. Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB- credit rating with a positive outlook in August 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, HESM Opco s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba2 by Moody s Investors Service. 
 Cash Requirements: 
 Our cash obligations and commitments over the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt, interest, lease payments, and purchase obligations which cover a portion of our planned capital expenditure program in 2023 and include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, carbon credits, transportation and related contracts, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. 
 Our long-term cash obligations and commitments include: 
 Debt and interest: See Note 7 , Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Operating and finance leases: The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 6 , Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Purchase obligations: We were contractually committed at December 31, 2022 for certain long-term capital expenditures and operating expenses. Long-term obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, transportation and related contracts, carbon credits, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. See Note 17 , G uarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Asset retirement obligations: See Note 8 , Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Post-retirement plan liabilities: We have certain unfunded post-retirement plans, including our post-retirement medical plan. See Note 9 , Retirement Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Uncertain income tax positions: See Note 14 , Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 See Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 Foreign Operations 
 We conduct E P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income . The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. 
 Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. 
 The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations 
 39 

for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 
 Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. 
 For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year. 
 Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors , crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were 94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: 66.34) and 97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: 68.92). At December 31, 2022, spot prices closed at 80.26 per barrel for WTI and 81.33 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2023 are at levels below that used in determining 2022 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2023 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2023 above those used in determining 2022 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2023. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2023, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2023 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2023 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2023 crude oil prices, and management s plans as of December 31, 2023 for developing proved undeveloped reserves . A 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 would result in an approximate 175 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2023 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 87 through 96 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. 
 In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. 
 Our impairment tests of long-lived E P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur: the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. 
 As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at March 31, 2020. We impaired various oil and gas fields located in Malaysia, Denmark, and the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Hess Midstream LP: We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP , which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation s approximate 41 consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP , and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP . This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP . 
 Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. 
 We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. 
 The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We remained in a recent cumulative loss position in the United States (non-Midstream) and Malaysia at December 31, 2022. A recent cumulative loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream), and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a 3,658 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. There is a reasonable possibility that if anticipated future earnings come to fruition and no other unforeseen negative evidence materializes, sufficient positive evidence may become available to support the release of all or a portion of the Company's valuation allowance in these jurisdictions in the near term. This would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations: We have legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income . See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations . 
 Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to: 
 41 

Discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost: The discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2022, a 0.25 decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately 65 million and would increase forecasted 2023 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately 2 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios. 
 Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category. The future expected rate of return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2022, a 0.25 decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2023 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately 5 million. 
 Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality. 
 Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet . Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. 
 Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for financial assets, and our credit is considered for financial liabilities. 
 We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. 
 We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. 
 Environment, Health and Safety 
 Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our EHS SR policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals and objectives. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The EPA has adopted a series of GHG monitoring, reporting, and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting further legislation to reduce GHG emissions. For example, in November 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of 
 42 

performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA issued a supplemental proposed rule on November 15, 2022, which provided additional information, including regulatory text, about the November 2021 proposed rule. The supplemental proposed rule would impose more stringent requirements than are currently applicable on the natural gas and oil industry. In addition, the IRA includes a methane emissions reduction program for petroleum and natural gas systems, which requires the EPA to impose a waste emissions charge on excess methane emissions from certain natural gas and oil sources that are required to report under EPA s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program beginning January 1, 2024 and also provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of competing low carbon energy production methods. Furthermore, states have taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. At the international level, the Paris Agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. We are committed to complying with all GHG emissions regulations that apply to our operations, including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas, and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. While we monitor climate-related regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues, the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties, legislation or new regulations. However, future restrictions on emissions of GHGs, or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products, as described under Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, EPA Superfund sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. For additional information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings . At December 31, 2022, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 55 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately 23 million in 2022 (2021: 16 million; 2020: 15 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
 As an element of our EHS and SR strategy, we purchase carbon credits annually to offset 100 percent of our estimated Scope 3 business travel emissions and 100 percent of our estimated Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions associated with operating the Corporation s truck fleet, aviation activities (aircraft and helicopters) and personal and rental vehicle miles driven on company business. We also offset purchased electricity used in our operations from nonrenewable sources by purchasing renewable energy certificates. The cost of these purchased and retired renewable energy certificates was not material to our financial results in 2022 and was included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income . 
 In December 2022, we announced an agreement with the Government of Guyana to purchase 37.5 million REDD+ carbon credits, including current and future issuances, for a minimum of 750 million from 2022 through 2032 to prevent deforestation and support sustainable development in Guyana. These credits will be on the ART Registry and will be independently verified to represent permanent and additional emissions reductions under ART's REDD+ Environmental Standard 2.0 (TREES). This agreement adds to the Corporation's ongoing emissions reduction efforts and is an important part of our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis by 2050. In December 2022, w e purchased 5 million REDD+ carbon credits registered on the ART Registry for 75 million under this agreement, which is included in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . 
 Health and Safety Matters 
 The crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of E P operations. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other matters, occupational safety, the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production, well control and integrity, process safety and equipment integrity, and may include permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas. The level of our expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. While compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general, it has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Occupational Safety : We are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Under OSHA and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate, we must develop, maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used, released, or produced in our operations. 
 43 

Production and Well Integrity : Our U.S. onshore production facilities are subject to U.S. federal government, state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity. Our offshore production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to the U.S. federal government s Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, which provide a systematic approach for identifying, managing and mitigating hazards. Adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate, and to safeguarding our product. 
 Process Safety and Equipment Integrity : We are also regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment, including OSHA s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard. ICE are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection, isolation, containment, control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities. We have established ICE performance standards, which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ICE barriers are effective. We conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets, subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment, health and safety standards and procedures, as well as with applicable regulations. For additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities, see Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties . 
 
 44 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. 
 Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: 
 Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. 
 Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Malaysian Ringgit, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. 
 Exchange-traded Contracts: We may use exchange-traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. 
 Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange-traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and are exposed to the favorable consequence of collecting payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and are exposed to the unfavorable consequence of having to make payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement. 
 Financial Risk Management Activities 
 We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling 177 million at December 31, 2022 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately 20 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of 8,281 million and a fair value of 8,192 million. A 15 increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately 465 million or 515 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hess Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hess Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties Description of the Matter The net book value of the Corporation s exploration and production assets was 11,917 million at December 31, 2022, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) expense was 1,520 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, capitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry based on evaluations of estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs. Significant judgment is required by the Corporation s internal engineering staff in interpreting the data used to estimate reserves. Estimating proved reserves also requires the selection and evaluation of inputs, including historical production, oil and natural gas price assumptions as well as future operating and capital costs assumptions, among others. Management used independent petroleum engineering specialists to audit approximately 89 of the Corporation's proved reserves at December 31, 2022 as prepared by the Corporation s internal engineering staff. 
 49 

Auditing the Corporation's DD A expense calculation is especially complex because of the use of the work of the Corporation's internal engineering staff and the independent petroleum engineering specialists and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by these engineering specialists in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD A expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. 
 
 Our testing of the Corporation s DD A expense calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist used to audit the estimates. On a sample basis, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. Additionally, we performed analytic and lookback procedures on select inputs into the oil and gas reserve estimate as well as on the outputs.

 consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP , and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP . Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20 to 50 owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method.

. 
 Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. International contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors. 
 Contract Balances: 
 Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights. Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas. At December 31, 2022, contract liabilities of million (2021: million) resulted from a take-or-pay deficiency payment received in 2021 that is subject to a make-up period expiring in December 2023. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were contract assets. 
 Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations: 
 The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied. 
 Sales-based Taxes: 
 We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. 
 Revenue from Non-customers: 
 In Guyana, the joint venture partners (Co-Venturers) to the Stabroek Block petroleum agreement are subject to the income tax laws of Guyana and remain primarily liable for income taxes due on the results of operations, resulting in recognition of income tax expense. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements of the petroleum agreement, a portion of gross production from the block, separate from the Co-Venturers cost oil and profit oil entitlement, is used to satisfy the Co-Venturers income tax liability. This portion of gross production, referred to as tax barrels, is included in our reported production volumes and is recognized as sales revenue from non-customers. 
 Midstream 
 Our Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services. 
 The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with certain subsidiaries of Hess, each generally with an initial term that can be extended for an additional term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E P segment s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The Midstream segment also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services with a subsidiary of Hess with an initial year term that can be extended for an additional term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees. 
 The Midstream segment s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under

At December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation had outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility. 
 The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to , and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility).

 Credit facilities : 
 In July 2022, HESM Opco amended and restated its credit agreement for its billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities consisting of a billion revolving credit facility and a fully drawn million term loan facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2024 to July 2027, increased the accordion feature to up to an additional million, which does not represent a lending commitment from the lenders, and replaced LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings under the new term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from to , while the applicable margin for the new syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from to . Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

The assets remaining after settlement of the plan's projected benefit obligation of million were transferred to the Hess Corporation Employees' Pension Plan in December 2022. 
 In 2023, we forecast service cost for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately million and net non-service cost of approximately million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately million.

 The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year. In 2022 and 2021, there was an interim remeasurement of the funded status of certain plans due to plan settlements which resulted in net periodic benefit cost being recalculated for the remainder of the year using assumptions as of the interim remeasurement dates. The assumptions disclosed in the preceding table used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2022 and 2021 are a weighted average of the assumptions as of the end of the previous year and the interim remeasurement dates. The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. Discount rates are developed based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. 
 The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of assets to that asset category. The future expected rate of return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. The expected rate of return on plan assets is applied to the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost for the year. 
 Our investment strategy is to maximize long term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we updated our target allocations to equity securities, fixed income securities (including cash and short term investment funds) and to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels.

 As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the global economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas properties within the Exploration and Production operating segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and certain related ROU assets at the North Malay Basin in Malaysia by million million after income taxes), the South Arne Field in Denmark by million million after income taxes), and in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede Field by million million after income taxes) and the Tubular Bells Field by million million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook.

 (a) In 2022, the valuation allowance decreased by million (2021: decrease of million; 2020: increase of million). 
 In the Consolidated Balance Sheet , deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by taxing jurisdiction and are recorded at December 31, as follows: 
 2022 2021 (In millions) Deferred income taxes (long-term asset) Deferred income taxes (long-term liability) ) ) Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) ) ) 
 At December 31, 2022, we have recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of million before application of valuation allowances. The deferred tax asset is comprised of million attributable to foreign net operating losses which will begin to expire in 2025, million attributable to U.S. federal operating losses which will begin to expire in 2034, and million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which will begin to expire in 2023. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. federal and state net operating losses, except for million of U.S. federal and million of U.S. state deferred tax assets attributable to Midstream activities for which separate U.S. federal and state tax returns are filed. At December 31, 2022, we have U.S. state tax credit carryforwards of million, which will begin to expire in 2034, million of other business credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2036, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million, which will begin to expire in 2024. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to these credits. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a million (2021: million) valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S. (non-Midstream) and Malaysia, and certain other jurisdictions, and did so against its deferred tax assets in Denmark prior to its sale in 2021 (see Note 11, Dispositions ). The reduction in valuation allowance year over year is primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax asset balances in the U.S. (non-Midstream) and Malaysia. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. A recent cumulative loss incurred in the U.S. and Malaysia constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. There is a reasonable possibility that if anticipated future earnings come to fruition and no other unforeseen negative evidence materializes, sufficient positive evidence may become available to support the release of all or a portion of the Company's valuation allowance in these jurisdictions in the near term. This would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded.

 remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants. 
 In September 2003, we received a directive from the NJDEP to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. Since

billion. The ROD does not address the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a final remedy for the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages. 
 In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA s original estimate was that this remedy would cost million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design. 
 From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a potential responsible party under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates. 
 Hess Corporation and its subsidiary HONX, Inc. have been named as defendants in various personal injury claims alleging exposure to asbestos and/or other alleged toxic substances while working at a former refinery (owned and operated by subsidiaries or related entities) located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. On April 28, 2022, HONX, Inc. initiated a Chapter 11 524G process in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, to resolve these asbestos-related claims. In February 2023, Hess, HONX, Inc., the Unsecured Creditors Committee, and counsel representing claimants, reached a mediated resolution of the matter, contingent upon final approvals of all parties and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. In light of this tentative resolution, we have increased our reserve for this matter. See Note 20, Subsequent Events. 
 We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty and working interest payments. We may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. 
 Subject to the foregoing, in management s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
 Our proved oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 25, 2019). The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Subsurface data used included well logs, reservoir core and fluid samples, production and pressure testing, static and dynamic pressure information, and reservoir surveillance. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In some cases, where appropriate, use of empirical and analytical methods, combined with analog data were used. Analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies were used to increase the quality and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
 In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. 
 Internal Controls 
 The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation s reported reserves (see pages 89 through 94 ). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors. 
 Qualifications 
 The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation s oil and gas reserves during 2022 was the Senior Manager, Global Reserves. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a MSc degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. He is also responsible for the Corporation s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization that establishes the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews. 
 Reserves Audit 
 We engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating approximately 89 of 2022 year end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2021: 88 ). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D M report, dated February 1, 2023, on the Corporation s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D M s letter report on the Corporation s December 31, 2022 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10 K. While the D M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and independently evaluated by D M, in the aggregate, differed by approximately 2.6 (2021: less than 2.5 of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit. 
 Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved Reserves 
 Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were 94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: 66.34; 2020: 39.77) and 97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: 
 89 

68.92; 2020: 43.43). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were 6.44 per mcf in 2022 (2021: 3.68; 2020: 2.16). 
 At December 31, 2022, spot prices closed at 80.26 per barrel for WTI and 81.33 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2023 are at levels below that used in determining 2022 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2023 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2023 above those used in determining 2022 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2023. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2023, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2023 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2023 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2023 crude oil prices, and management s plans as of December 31, 2023 for developing proved undeveloped reserves .

 Extensions, discoveries and other additions Additions 
 2022: In the United States, Additions in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years were 79 million boe. In Guyana, Additions of 102 million boe were due to the sanctioning of the Yellowtail Field development (94 million boe), and extension of the proved area of the Payara Field (8 million boe). 
 2021: In the United States, Additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 257 million boe, which resulted from additional undeveloped well locations due to improved economic conditions, planned additional drilling activity, and development plan optimization. In Guyana, Additions of 9 million boe related to the deepening of the hydrocarbon contact for Liza Phase 2. In Malaysia and JDA, Additions were due to additional planned wells to be drilled. 
 2020: In the United States, Additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 78 million boe, which primarily resulted from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years, including the impact of optimizing locations in the development plan. In Guyana, Additions of 50 million boe were due to the sanction of the Payara project. In Malaysia, Additions at the North Malay Basin were due to additional planned wells to be drilled. 
 Revisions of previous estimates 
 2022: In the United States, net negative reserve revisions of 35 million boe were primarily from the Bakken, which included a net decrease of 26 million boe related to wells moved outside the five-year development plan, and other negative revisions of 9 million boe primarily related to performance and updates to ownership interests. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions were 5 million boe, which included a net increase of 13 million boe primarily from increased recovery based on performance partially offset by negative revisions of 8 million boe related to the impact of higher crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract. 
 2021: In the United States, net negative reserve revisions of 16 million boe were primarily from the Bakken, which included a decrease of 88 million boe largely related to wells moved outside the five-year development plan mainly based on optimization of drilling locations and other net negative revisions of 8 million boe, partially offset by positive revisions of 80 million boe related to higher prices. In Guyana, net negative reserve revisions were 4 million boe, which included negative revisions of 16 million boe related to the impact of higher crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract and negative revisions of 3 million boe resulting from decreased natural gas for consumption. Positive revisions of 15 million boe in Guyana resulted from improved recovery associated with water and gas injection. 
 2020: In the United States, negative reserve revisions of 146 million boe were from the Bakken, which included negative price revisions of 77 million boe, and a decrease of 121 million boe from wells moved outside our management and Board approved five-year plan due to a reduction in planned rig count and optimization of drilling locations in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by positive revisions of 52 million boe, primarily due to optimized development spacing and increased well productivity. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions for Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 
 93 

totaling 42 million boe resulted from improved recovery associated with water injection (45 ), the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract (40 and increased natural gas for consumption (15 ). For Other, net negative reserves revisions were 14 million boe in Libya and 11 million boe in Denmark due to moving planned wells outside our five-year plan in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020. 
 Transfers to proved developed reserves Transfers

 2021: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 19 million boe in the Bakken, and 4 million boe at JDA. Transfers in 2021 were consistent with the development plan used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2020. 
 2020: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 83 million boe in the Bakken, 2 million boe in the Gulf of Mexico, 8 million boe for Liza Phase 1 in Guyana, and 7 million boe in the North Malay Basin. 
 In 2022, capital expenditures of 1,780 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2021: 190 million; 2020: 1,090 million). 
 At December 31, 2022, projects that have proved reserves that have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years totaled 14 million boe, or approximately 1 of total proved reserves, related to the multi-phase offshore developments, primarily at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and North Malay Basin, offshore Malaysia. 
 Production Sharing Contracts 
 The Corporation s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. The Corporation's operations with these production sharing arrangements include those in Guyana, Malaysia, and the JDA. Proved reserves for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, as well as volumes produced and received during 2022, 2021 and 2020 from these production sharing contracts are presented in the proved reserve tables on pages 90 and 91 . Revisions resulting from the entitlement impact of price changes in production sharing contracts decreased proved reserves by 14 million boe in 2022 (2021: 17 million boe decrease; 2020: 22 million boe increase).

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
 Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development costs (including future abandonment expenditures) and future production costs, which are based on year end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year end statutory tax rates to the pre tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10 . 
 The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2022 were 94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: 66.34; 2020: 39.77) and 97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: 68.92; 2020: 43.43) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. NYMEX natural gas prices used were 6.44 per mcf in 2022 (2021: 3.68; 2020: 2.16). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. The discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.

 Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Pursuant to your request, this report of third party presents an independent evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, of the net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves of certain properties in which Hess Corporation (Hess) has represented it holds an interest to determine the reasonableness of Hess estimates. This evaluation was completed on February 1, 2023. Hess has represented that these properties account for approximately 89 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Hess net proved reserves, as of December 31, 2022, and that the net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is our opinion that the procedures and methodologies employed by Hess for the preparation of its proved reserves estimates as of December 31, 2022, comply with the current requirements of the SEC. We have reviewed information provided by Hess that it represents to be Hess estimates of the net reserves, as of December 31, 2022, for the same properties as those which we evaluated. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Hess. 
 Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Hess. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2022. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests held by Hess after deducting all interests held by others. 
 Certain properties evaluated herein are subject to the terms of production sharing contracts (PSC). The terms of these PSCs generally allow for working interest participants to be reimbursed for portions of capital costs and operational expenses, 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 2 

and to share in the profits. The reimbursements and profit proceeds are converted to a barrel of oil equivalent or standard cubic foot of gas equivalent by dividing by product prices to estimate the entitlement quantities. These entitlement quantities are equivalent in principle to net reserves and are used to calculate an equivalent net share, termed an entitlement interest. In this report, Hess net reserves or interest for the properties subject to these PSCs is the entitlement based on Hess working interest . 
 Estimates of reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information. 
 Information used in the preparation of this report was obtained from Hess. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Hess with respect to the property interests being evaluated, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. 
 Definition of Reserves 
 Petroleum reserves estimated by Hess included in this report are classified as proved. Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used by Hess in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 3 

Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any and, (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 4 

(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the 
 operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and, (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 (v) Existing economic and operating conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12 month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 
 Developed oil and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 5 

using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in Section 210.4 10(a) Definitions , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 
 Methodology and Procedures 
 Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC and with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019) Approved by the SPE Board on 25 June 2019 and in Monograph 3 and Monograph 4 published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. 
 Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Hess, and analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved. The proved undeveloped reserves estimates were based on opportunities identified in the plan of development provided by Hess. 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 6 

Hess has represented that its senior management is committed to the development plan provided by Hess and that Hess has the financial capability to execute the development plan, including the drilling and completion of wells and the installation of equipment and facilities. 
 For the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs, a performance-based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for this report. Performance-based methodology primarily includes (1) production diagnostics, (2) decline-curve analysis, and (3) model-based analysis (if necessary, based on availability of data). Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes, and characteristic well performance behavior. These analyses were performed for all well groupings (or type-curve areas). 
 Characteristic rate-decline profiles from diagnostic interpretation were translated to modified hyperbolic rate profiles, including one or multiple b-exponent values followed by an exponential decline. Based on the availability of data, model-based analysis may be integrated to evaluate long-term decline behavior, the effect of dynamic reservoir and fracture parameters on well performance, and complex situations sourced by the nature of unconventional reservoirs. 
 When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP) and original gas in place (OGIP). Structure maps were prepared to delineate each reservoir, and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation. When adequate data were available and when circumstances justified, material-balance methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP. 
 Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP and OGIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate recovery factors based on an analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and reservoir fluid properties. 
 For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 7 

estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production as defined under the Definition of Reserves heading of this report or the expiration of the fiscal agreement, as appropriate. 
 In certain cases, reserves were estimated by incorporating elements of analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available. 
 In the evaluation of undeveloped reserves, type-well analysis was performed using well data from analogous reservoirs for which more complete historical performance data were available. 
 Data provided by Hess from wells drilled through December 1, 2022, and made available for this evaluation were used to prepare the reserves estimates herein. These reserves estimates were based on consideration of monthly production data available for most properties through August 2022. Estimated cumulative production, as of December 31, 2022, was deducted from the estimated gross ultimate recovery to estimate gross reserves. This required that production be estimated for up to 6 months. 
 Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are to be recovered by normal field separation. NGL reserves estimated herein include pentanes and heavier fractions (C5+) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which consists primarily of propane and butane fractions, and are the result of low-temperature plant processing. Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves included in this report are expressed in millions of barrels (106bbl). In these estimates, 1 barrel equals 42 United States gallons. For reporting purposes, oil and condensate reserves have been estimated separately and are presented herein as a summed quantity. 
 Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as marketable gas and fuel gas. Marketable gas is defined as the total gas produced from the reservoir after reduction for shrinkage resulting from field separation processing, including removal of the nonhydrocarbon gas to meet pipeline specifications and flare and other losses but not from fuel usage. Fuel gas is that portion of the gas consumed in field operations. Gas reserves estimated herein are reported as marketable gas therefore, fuel gas is included as reserves. Gas quantities are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit F) and at a pressure base of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). Gas quantities included in this report are expressed in billions of cubic feet (10 9 ft 3 ). 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 8 

Gas quantities are identified by the type of reservoir from which the gas will be produced. Nonassociated gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions with no oil present in the reservoir. Associated gas includes both gas-cap gas and solution gas. Gas-cap gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions and is in communication with an underlying oil zone. Solution gas is gas dissolved in oil at initial reservoir conditions. Gas quantities estimated herein include both associated and nonassociated gas. 
 At the request of Hess, marketable gas reserves estimated herein were converted to oil equivalent using an energy equivalent factor of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per 1 barrel of oil equivalent. 
 Primary Economic Assumptions 
 This report has been prepared using initial prices, expenses, and costs provided by Hess in United States dollars (U.S. ). Future prices were estimated using guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The following economic assumptions were used for estimating the reserves reported herein 
 Oil and Condensate Prices 
 Hess has represented that the oil and condensate prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. The 12-month average reference prices used were U.S. 94.13 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate and U.S. 97.98 per barrel for Brent. Hess supplied differentials by field to the relevant reference prices and the prices were held constant thereafter. The volume-weighted average price attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the independently evaluated properties was U.S. 92.80 per barrel of oil and condensate. 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 9 

NGL Prices 
 Hess has represented that the NGL prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. The volume weighted average price attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the independently evaluated properties was U.S. 35.92 per barrel of NGL. 
 Gas Prices 
 Hess has represented that gas prices were based on reference prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of- the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. The 12-month average reference price for NYMEX was U.S. 6.44 per million Btu. The gas prices were adjusted for each property using differentials to the NYMEX reference price furnished by Hess and held constant thereafter. The volume-weighted average price attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the independently evaluated properties was U.S. 5.77 per thousand cubic feet of gas. 
 Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs 
 Estimates of operating expenses and future capital expenditures, provided by Hess and based on existing economic conditions, were held constant for the lives of the properties. In certain cases, future expenditures, either higher or lower than current expenditures, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions, but no general escalation that might result from inflation was applied. Abandonment costs, which are those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of the wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment, were provided by Hess for all properties and were not adjusted for inflation. Operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment

costs were considered, as appropriate, in determining the economic viability of the undeveloped reserves. 
 In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, and 932235-50-9 of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the FASB and Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S K of the SEC provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year. 
 To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.

Summary of Conclusions 
 DeGolyer and MacNaughton has performed an independent evaluation of the extent of the estimated net proved oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves of certain properties in which Hess has represented it holds an interest. Hess has represented that its estimated net proved reserves attributable to the evaluated properties were based on the definition of proved reserves of the SEC. Hess estimates of the net proved reserves, as of December 31, 2022, attributable to these properties, which represent approximately 89 percent of Hess reserves on a net equivalent basis, are summarized as follows, expressed in millions of barrels (106bbl), billions of cubic feet (109ft3), and millions of barrels of oil equivalent (106boe)

 1. Marketable gas reserves estimated herein were converted to oil equivalent using an energy equivalent factor of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per 1 barrel of oil equivalent. 
 2. Net proved fuel gas reserves included as a portion of marketable gas reserves were estimated to be 145 10 9 ft 3 . 
 3. Joint Development Area is abbreviated JDA. 
 
 In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates by field prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton and by Hess, differences have been found, both positive and negative, resulting in an aggregate difference of approximately 2.6 percent when compared on the basis of net equivalent barrels. It is DeGolyer and MacNaughton s opinion that the total net proved reserves estimates prepared by Hess, as of December 31, 2022, on the properties evaluated and referred to above, when compared on the basis of net equivalent barrels, do not differ materially from those prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. 
 Hess oil and gas reserves were estimated assuming the continuation of the current regulatory environment. Changes in the regulatory environment by host 

DeGolyer and MacNaughton 12 

governments may affect the operating environment and oil and gas reserves estimates of industry participants. Such regulatory changes could include increased mandatory government participation in producing contracts, changes in royalty terms, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, or expropriation or nationalization of property. While the oil and gas industry is subject to regulatory changes that could affect an industry participant s ability to recover its reserves, neither we nor Hess are aware of any such governmental actions which restrict the recovery of the December 31, 2022, estimated reserves.
