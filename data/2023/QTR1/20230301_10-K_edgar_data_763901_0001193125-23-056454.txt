 Transformation Initiative: 
 The 
Corporation 
launched 
a 
significant, 
multi-year, 
broad-based 
technological

process 
transformation

 second half of 2022. 
The needs and expectations of our clients, as well

 to make important investments in our technological infrastructure and adopt more agile practices. We 
believe these investments will 
 result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients, as

 and make us a more efficient and 
profitable company, allowing us to 
achieve a 14 return on tangible common equity target by

will be a significant 
priority for the Corporation over 
the next three years

 Lending Activities 
 We concentrate our lending activities in the following areas: 

8 
 (1) Commercial. 
Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial C I loans and leases to commercial customers 
 for 
use 
in 
normal 
business 
operations 
and 
to 
finance 
working 
capital 
needs, 
equipment 
purchases 
or 
other 
projects, 
and 
(ii) 
 commercial real 
estate CRE loans 
(excluding construction loans) 
for income-producing real 
estate properties as 
well as 
owner-
 occupied properties. C I 
loans are underwritten 
individually and usually 
secured with the 
assets of the 
company and the 
personal 
 guarantee 
of 
the 
business 
owners. CRE 
loans consist 
of 
loans 
for 
income-producing real 
estate 
properties and 
the financing 
of 
 owner-occupied facilities 
if there 
is real 
estate as 
collateral. Non-owner-occupied 
CRE loans 
are generally 
made to 
finance office 
 and 
industrial buildings, 
healthcare facilities, 
multifamily buildings 
and 
retail shopping 
centers 
and are 
repaid through 
cash 
flows 
 related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the 
property. 
 (2) Mortgage. Mortgage 
loans include residential 
mortgage loans to 
consumers for the 
purchase or refinancing 
of a 
residence and 
 also include residential construction loans made 
to individuals for the construction of refurbishment 
of their residence. 

 (3) Consumer. 
Consumer loans are mainly 
comprised of personal loans, 
credit cards, and automobile 
loans, and to 
a lesser extent 
 home equity lines of credit HELOCs and other 
loans made by banks to individual borrowers. 

 (4) 
Construction. 
Construction 
loans 
are 
CRE 
loans 
to 
companies 
or 
developers 
used 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
commercial 
or 
 residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale 
or permanent financing of the property. 
Our construction loan 
 portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and 
condominiums), office and warehouse product types. 

 (5) Lease Financings. 
Lease financings are offered by BPPR and are 
primarily comprised of automobile loans/leases made through 
 automotive dealerships and equipment lease financings.

are currently concentrated 
primarily in 
Puerto Rico, 
our results 
of operations 
and financial 
 condition are dependent upon the general trends of 
the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, 
the residential and commercial real 
 estate markets. The concentration of our 
operations in Puerto Rico exposes us 
to greater risk than other 
banking companies with a 
 wider 
geographic 
base. 
Our 
asset 
and 
revenue 
composition 
by 
geographical 
area 
is 
presented 
in 
 Financial 
Information 
about 
 Geographic Areas below and in Note 37 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 
 Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. 
However, approximately 57 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 consisted 
 of real estate-related 
loans, including residential 
mortgage loans, construction 
loans and commercial 
loans secured by 
commercial 
 real estate. The table below presents the distribution

 Interest 
from our 
loan portfolios 
is our 
principal source 
of revenue. 
Whenever we 
make loans, 
we expose 
ourselves 
to 
 credit 
risk. 
Credit 
risk 
is 
controlled 
and 
monitored 
through 
active 
asset 
quality 
management, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
lending 
 standards, 
thorough 
review 
of 
potential 
borrowers 
and through 
active 
asset quality 
administration. 
 Business 
activities 
that 
expose 
us to 
credit 
risk are 
managed 
within 
the 
Board 
of Director s 
Risk Management policy, 
 and the Credit Risk Tolerance 
Limits policy, 
which establishe 
s 
limits 
that 
consider 
factors 
such 
as maintainin 
g 
a prudent 
balance 
 of risk-taking 
across 
diversified 
risk types 
and business 
units, 
compliance 
with regulator 
y 
guidance, 
and 
controlling 
the 
exposure 
 to lower 
credit 
quality 
assets. 
 We maintain 
comprehensive 
credit policies 
for all lines of 
business in order 
to mitigate credit 
risk. Our credit 
policies 
are 
 approved by 
our Board 
of Directors. 
These policies set 
forth, 
among 
other 
things, 
 the objectives, scope and 
responsibilities of the 
 credit 
management cycle. 
Our 
internal 
written 
procedures 
establish 
 underwriting 
standards 
and 
procedures 
for 
monitoring 
and 
 evaluating 
loan 
portfolio 
quality 
and 
require 
prompt 
identificatio 
n 
and 
quantificatio 
n 
of 
asset 
quality 
deterioration 
or 
potential 
 loss 
to 
ensure 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses. 
These 
written 
procedures 
establish 
various 
approval 
and 
 lending 
limit 
levels, 
ranging 
from 
bank 
branch 
or 
department 
officers 
to 
managerial 
and 
senior 
management 
levels. 
Approval 
 levels are
 primarily 
determined 
by the 
amount, 
type 
of loan 
and risk 
characteristics 
of the credit 
facility. 
 Our 
credit 
policies 
and 
procedures 
establish 
documentation 
requirements 
for 
each 
loan 
and 
related 
collateral 
type, 
 when 
applicable, 
during 
the 
underwriting, 
closing 
and 
monitoring 
phases. 
For 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans, 
during 
the 
 initial 
loan 
underwriting 
process, 
the 
credit 
policies 
require, 
at 
a 
minimum, 
historical 
financial 
statements 
or 
tax 
returns 
of 
the 
 borrower, 
an analysis 
of financial 
information 
contained 
in 
a 
credit 
approval 
package, 
a 
risk 
rating 
determination 
and 
reports 
 from 
credit 
agencies 
and appraisal 
s 
for 
real 
estate-related 
loans when applicable 
. 
The credit 
policies 
also 
set 
forth 
the 
required 
 closing 
documentation 
depending 
on the 
loan 
and the 
collateral 
type. 
 Although 
we originat 
e 
most 
of our 
loans 
internally 
in both 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
and mainlan 
d 
United 
States 
markets, 
we 
 occasionally 
purchase 
or 
participate 
in 
loans 
originated 
by 
other 
financial 
institutions. 
When 
we 
purchase 
or 
participate 
in 
 loans 
originated 
by 
others, 
we 
conduct 
the 
same 
underwriting 
analysis 
of 
the borrower 
s 
and apply 
the 
same 
criteria 
as we do 
 for 
loans 
originated 
by us. This also 
includes 
a review 
of the 
applicable 
legal 
documentation. 

 Refer

 Loan 
extensions 
, 
renewals 
and restructurings
 Loans with 
satisfactory 
credit 
profiles 
can be 
extended, 
renewed 
or restructured 
. 
Many commercia 
l 
loan facilities 
are 
 structured 
as lines 
of credit, which 
are mainly 
one year 
in term 
and therefore 
are required 
to be renewed 
annually. 
Other 
facilities 
 may be restructure 
d 
or extended 
from time 
to time based 
upon changes 
in the 
borrower s 
business 
needs, 
use 
of 
funds, 
timing 
 of 
completion 
of 
projects 
and 
other 
factors. 
If 
the 
borrower 
is 
not 
deemed 
to 
have 
financial 
difficulties 
, 
extensions, 
renewals 
 and restructuring 
s 
are done 
in the 
normal 
course 
of busines 
s 
and the 
loans 
continue 
to be recorde 
d 
as performing. 
 We 
evaluate 
various 
factors 
to 
determine 
if 
a 
borrower 
is 
experiencing 
financial 
difficulties. 
Indicators 
that 
the 
 borrower 
is 
experiencing 
financial difficultie 
s 
include, 
for example: 
(i) 
the borrower 
is currently 
in default on 
any of its debt 
or it is 
 probable tha 
t 
the borrower 
would be 
in payment 
default on 
any of 
its debt 
in th 
e 
foreseeable 
future 
without 
the modificatio 
n; 
(ii) 

 the 
borrower 
has declare 
d 
or is in 
the 
process 
of declarin 
g 
bankruptcy; 
(iii) 
there 
is significan 
t 
doubt 
as to 
whether 
the 
borrower 
 will 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
going 
concern; 
(iv) 
the 
borrower 
has 
securities 
that 
have 
been 
delisted, 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
 delisted, 
or 
are 
under threa 
t 
of bein 
g 
delisted 
from 
an exchange 
; 
(v) based 
on estimate 
s 
and projection 
s 
that 
only 
encompass 
 the 
current 
business 
capabilities 
, 
the 
borrower 
forecasts 
that 
its 
entity-specifi 
c 
cash 
flows 
will 
be 
insufficien 
t 
to 
service 
the 
 debt 
(both 
interest 
and 
principal) 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
existing 
agreement 
through 
maturity; 
and 
 (vi) 
absent 
the 
current 
modification, 
the 
borrower 
cannot 
obtain 
funds 
from 
sources 
other 
than 
the 
existing 
creditors 
at 
an 
 effective 
interest 
rate 
equal to the current market 
interest 
rate for similar 
debt for a non-trouble 
d 
debtor. 
 We 
have 
specialized 
workout 
officers 
who 
handle 
the majority 
of 
commercial 
loans 
that 
are 
past 
due 
90 
days 
and 
 over, 
borrowers 
experiencing 
financial 
difficulties 
, 
and loans 
that 
are considere 
d 
problem 
loans 
based 
on their 
risk profile 
. 
As a 

10 
 general 
policy, 
we 
do 
not 
advance 
additional 
money 
to 
borrowers 
who 
have 
loans 
that 
are 
90 
days 
past 
due 
or 
over. 
In 
 commercial 
and 
construction 
loans, 
certain 
exceptions 
may 
be approve 
d 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
including 
(i) when 
past 
 due 
status 
is administrativ 
e 
in nature, 
such 
as expiration 
of a loan 
facility 
before 
the 
new documentatio 
n 
is executed, 
and not as 
 a result 
of paymen 
t 
or credit 
issues; 
(ii) to 
improve 
our collateral 
position 
or 
otherwise 
maximize 
recovery 
or 
mitigate 
potential 
 future 
losses; 
and 
(iii) 
with 
respect 
to 
certain 
entities 
that, 
although 
related 
through 
common 
ownership 
, 
are 
not 
cross 
 defaulted 
nor 
cross-collateralized 
and 
are 
performing 
satisfactorily 
under 
their 
respective 
loan 
facilities. 
Such 
advances 
are 
 underwritten 
and 
approved 
following 
our 
credit 
policy 
guidelines 
and 
limits, 
which 
are 
dependent 
on 
the 
borrower s 
financial 
 condition, 
collateral 
and guarantee, 
among 
others. 
 In addition 
to the legal 
lending limit 
established under 
applicable 
state banking 
law, discusse 
d 
in detail 
below, 
business 
 activities 
that 
expose the 
Corporation to 
credit 
risk 
are managed 
within 
guidelines described 
in the

 Competition
 The 
financial 
services 
industry 
in 
which 
we 
operate 
is 
highly 
competitive. 
In 
Puerto 
Rico, 
our 
primary 
market, 
the 
 banking 
business 
is 
highly 
competitive 
with 
respect 
to 
originatin 
g 
loans, 
acquiring 
deposits 
and 
providing 
other 
banking 
 services. 
Most 
of 
our 
direct 
competitio 
n 
for 
our 
products 
and 
services 
comes 
from 
commercial 
banks and 
credit unions. 
 The 
principal 
competitors 
for 
BPPR 
include 
locally 
based 
commercial 
banks 
and 
a 
few 
large 
U.S. 
and 
foreign 
banks 
with 
 operations 
in Puerto 
Rico. 
While 
the 
number 
of 
banking 
competitors 
in 
Puerto 
Rico 
has 
been 
reduced 
in 
recent 
years 
as 
a 
 result 
of 
consolidations, 
these 
transactions 
have 
allowed 
some 
of 
our 
competitors 
to 
gain 
greater 
resources, 
such 
as 
a 
 broader 
range of 
products 
and services. 
 We 
also 
compete 
with 
specialized 
players 
in th 
e 
local 
financial 
industry 
that 
are 
not subje 
ct 
to 
the 
same 
regulatory 
 restrictions 
as domestic 
banks 
and bank holdin 
g 
companies. 
Those 
competitors 
include 
brokerage 
firms, 
mortgage 
companies, 
 insurance 
companies, 
automobile 
and 
equipment 
finance 
companies, 
local 
and 
federal 
credit 
unions 
(locally 
known 
as 
 cooperativas), 
credit car 
d 
companies, 
consumer 
finance 
companies, 
institutional 
lenders 
and other 
financial 
and non-financia 
l 
 institutions 
and 
entities. 
Credit 
unions 
generally 
provide 
basic 
consumer 
financial 
services. 
These 
competitors 
collectively 
 represent a significant 
portion of the 
market and have 
a lower cost structure 
and fewer regulatory 
constraints. 
 In 
the 
United 
States 
we 
continue 
to 
face 
substantial 
competitive 
pressure 
as 
our 
footprint 
resides 
in 
the 
two 
large, 
 metropolitan markets of 
New York 
City / Northern 
New Jersey and 
the greater Miami 
area. 
There is a 
large number of 
community 
 and 
regional 
banks 
along 
with 
national 
banking 
institutions 
present 
in 
both 
markets, 
many 
of 
which 
have 
a 
larger 
amount 
of 
 resources than us. 
 In both 
Puerto Rico 
and the 
United States, 
the primary 
factors in 
competing 
for business 
include 
pricing, 
convenience 
 of branch 
locations 
and other 
delivery 
methods, 
range of 
products offered, 
and the 
level of 
service delivered. 
We must 
compete 
 effectively 
along 
all 
these 
parameters 
to 
be 
successful. 
We 
experience 
pricing 
pressure 
as 
some 
of 
our 
competitors 
seek 
to 
 increase 
market 
share 
by 
reducing 
prices 
for 
services 
or 
the 
rates 
charged 
on 
loans, 
increasing 
the 
interest 
rates 
offered 
on 
 deposits 
or offering 
more flexible 
terms. Increased 
competition 
could require 
that we 
increase 
the rates 
offered 
on deposits 
and 
 lower the rates 
charged on loans, 
which could adversely 
affect our profitability. 
 Economic 
factors, 
along 
with 
legislative 
and 
technological 
changes, 
have 
an 
ongoing 
impact 
on 
the 
competitive 
 environment 
within 
the financia 
l 
services 
industry. 
We work 
to anticipat 
e 
and adap 
t 
to dynamic 
competitive 
conditions 
whether 
 through developing 
and marketing 
innovative 
products 
and services, 
adopting 
or developin 
g 
new technologie 
s 
that 
differentiat 
e 
 our product 
s 
and 
services 
, 
cross-marketing 
, 
or 
providing 
personalized 
banking 
services. 
We 
strive 
to 
distinguish 
ourselves 
 from 
other 
banks 
and 
financial 
services 
providers 
in our 
marketplace 
by providin 
g 
a high 
level 
of service 
to enhance 
customer 
 loyalty 
and to attrac 
t 
and retain 
business. 
However, 
we can 
provide 
no assuranc 
e 
as 
to 
the 
effectivenes 
s 
of 
these 
effort 
s 
on 
 our

our 
services 
and/or 
banking 
products, 
in 
order 
to 
successfully 
compete 
in 
our 
primary 
 service 
areas. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Attracting, developing, and retaining top 
talent in an environment that 
promotes wellness, inclusion, learning, and transparency 
is a 
 fundamental pillar of our long-term strategy. 
As of December 31, 2022, Popular 
employed approximately 8,900 employees, none of 
 whom are represented by a collective bargaining group
 . 

 Employee Well-Being Safety 
 We are 
cognizant that 
our journey 
to become 
a better 
organization is 
dependent on 
fostering our 
employees health 
and financial 
 wellbeing. The health and wellness of our employees are the foundation of our ability to support our customers and the communities 
 we serve. The 
Corporation offers our employees 
a comprehensive benefits package, including, 
but not limited to, 
health insurance, 
 paid time off, 
and wellness initiatives. Our full 
and part-time employees have access 
to affordable healthcare with Popular 
covering 
 up 
to 
90 
of 
the 
premium. Additionally, 
the 
Corporation promotes 
employee 
health 
by 
encouraging annual 
physical 
exams and 
 maintaining 
a 
Health 
and 
Wellness 
Center 
at 
its 
Puerto 
Rico-based 
corporate 
offices 
staffed 
with 
healthcare 
providers, 
where 
 employees and eligible dependents can complete their physical exam, 
receive acute care or visit a nutritionist or psychologist free of 
 charge. The 
Health and 
Wellness Center 
received more 
than 18,600 
in-person and 
virtual visits 
from employees 
during 2022 
and 
 acted as a key component to effectively manage the 
challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The 
Corporation 
also 
provides 
targeted 
benefits 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
work-life 
balance. 
For 
example, 
the 
Corporation s 
time 
off 
 program includes 
community service 
leave, paid 
parental leave 
(including for 
childbirth, adoption, 
and bonding 
time) 
and flexible 
 work arrangements. In 
addition, the Corporation 
implemented a hybrid 
work model, for 
which 49 
of our 
population is eligible. 
To 
 support 
our 
employees 
emotional 
well-being 
during 
the 
pandemic, 
we 
have 
continued 
enhancing 
our 
Well-Being 
Academy 
by 
 adapting our Employee Assistance Program to offer virtual mental health sessions geared at managing work and 
life challenges. 
In 
 addition, 
the 
Corporation 
offers 
physical 
fitness 
events 
and 
breaks, 
as 
well 
as 
employee 
workshops 
on 
personal 
financial 
 management. 

 Popular also 
offers a 
401(k) savings and 
investment plan. Popular 
matches 0.50 for 
every dollar the 
employee contributes to 
the 
 401(k) plan, up to 8 
of their salary. 
Moreover, the organization offers 
a profit-sharing plan, which depends on the 
achievement of 
 certain 
predetermined 
financial 
goals, 
through 
which 
employees 
may 
receive 
up 
to 
8 
of 
eligible 
compensation 
(capped 
at 
 70,000), partially 
in cash 
and partially 
as a 
401(k) contribution. 
Furthermore, since 
2017 we 
have invested 
in our 
compensation 
 strategy, 
introducing a 
job leveling 
framework, adjusting 
salaries to 
better compete 
with the 
market, offering 
merit increases, 
and 
 raising our base salary to 13 
per hour in Puerto Rico, 15 
per hour in the Virgin Islands, 
 17 per hour in Florida, and 20 
per hour 
 in New York 
and New Jersey. 
During January 2023, there 
was an additional 
increase to 15 
per hour for 
Puerto Rico and 
 16 per 
 hour in the Virgin Islands. 
 Talent Development 
 Popular strives 
to develop 
the skills 
of its 
employees and 
leaders to 
sustain the 
Corporation s competitive 
advantage. Employees 
 are subject to 
mandatory trainings in 
connection with regulatory compliance 
matters and other 
key topics throughout 
the year. 
Our 
 40,000 square 
foot Development 
Center in 
San Juan, 
Puerto Rico 
offers training 
sessions, activities, 
and workshops 
year-round. 
 During 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
continued 
offering 
virtual 
training 
after 
effectively 
transitioning 
most 
sessions 
provided 
in 
the 
 Development Center to a virtual setting to continue impacting employee growth despite the pandemic. More than 300 sessions were 
 delivered, 
with 
around 
6,500 
participating 
employees. 
Our 
English 
Program 
helps 
employees 
whose 
first 
language 
is 
Spanish 
 strengthen 
their 
English 
language 
skills 
and 
feel 
confident 
speaking, 
reading, 
and 
writing 
in 
business 
or 
personal 
settings. 
 Additionally, the 
English Placement Test 
revealed that in 2022 
the number of 
intermediate learners increased from 4 
to 17 and 
 advanced learners 
from 45 
to 53 , 
compared to 
2021. 
Popular also 
continues to 
promote the 
use of 
LinkedIn Learning, 
which 
 features over 16,000 on-demand e-learning courses 
available anytime and anywhere, to strengthen 
and advance the Corporation s 
 development 
strategies 
for 
all 
its 
employees.The 
organization s 
strong 
training 
and 
development 
framework 
has 
contributed 
to 
 internal growth opportunities for our employees. As 
a result, the Corporation s internal mobility 
rate in 2022 was 33 . This 
included 
 employees who applied or were selected for 
vacancies, were promoted, or had lateral movements.

 Popular received 
the BAI 
Innovation in 
Learning 
Development Award for 
being a 
Talent 
Lab 
Skills Accelerator. 
This year, 
we 
 performed an internal talent 
and skills inventory of 
83 of employees to 
reveal underutilized skills and 
education. The organization 
 invested in 
the development 
of 126 
practitioners who 
went through 
Accelerated Development 
Programs focused 
on data 
science 
 and analytics, process excellence and program management, 
among other topics. 
 Recognizing that leadership development is crucial to driving 
results, keeping employees engaged, and achieving the Corporation s 
 strategic 
goals, Popular 
has 
implemented programs 
aimed 
at 
strengthening and 
developing leadership 
skills 
and 
effective 
talent 
 management. As part of the Corporation s Executive Leadership Development 
strategy, readiness courses are offered to employees 
 in topics such as change management, conscious inclusion, leading 
hybrid teams, and better conversations focused on the return to 
 office scenarios. 

 Our 
organizational 
development 
strategy 
is 
aimed 
at 
creating 
organizational 
and 
leadership 
effectiveness, 
while 
advancing 
 organizational readiness 
to succeed 
based on 
our future 
needs. There 
were more 
than 80 
organizational development 
and team 
 interventions 
and 
exercises 
facilitated 
during 
2022, 
spanning 
the 
areas 
of 
change 
management, 
team 
alignment 
and 
leader 
 effectiveness. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 At Popular, 
we value our 
differences and strive 
to improve the 
workplace experience for 
all. As of 
December 31, 2022, 65 
of the 
 Corporation s employees 
were female, 
while 35 
were male. 
Women accounted 
for 64 
of first 
and mid-level 
management and 
 33 
of 
executive-level management 
as 
of such 
date. The 
Corporation also 
maintains 
a multidisciplinary 
council, 
headed by 
our 
 Corporate 
Diversity 
Officer, 
which 
helps 
develop 
and 
implement 
initiatives 
to 
support 
the 
Corporation s 
Diversity, 
Equity, 
and 
 Inclusion (DE I) 
policy and 
strategy. 
The Corporation s 
DE I strategy 
seeks to 
broaden the 
inclusion, employment 
advancement 
 and development 
of underrepresented 
communities in 
the workplace, 
as well 
as the 
utilization of 
suppliers owned, 
controlled, or 
 operated by 
women or 
diverse racial 
or ethnic 
groups. In 
addition, this 
strategy seeks 
to prepare 
the Corporation s 
employees to 
 recognize and value the differences of those we 
serve. 

We are 
committed to 
fair pay 
and conduct 
analyses on 
such matter 
on an 
annual basis. 
The 2022 
company-wide market 
salary 
 adjustments resulted 
in an 
overall improvement 
to our 
gender gap 
of +1.5 
percentage points, 
compared to 
the end 
of 2021. 
Our 
 gender 
pay 
gap 
continues 
to 
narrow 
improving 
3.1 
percentage 
points 
over 
the 
last 
five 
years. 
Additionally, 
for 
the 
second 
 consecutive year (2022-2023), Popular was honored to 
be included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality 
Index (GEI). 
 The Corporation has 
also expressed public 
support for 
movements advocating for 
equality such as 
Pride Month. 
In 2021, 
Popular 
 established its first Employee Resource Group (ERG) for 
our LGBTQ+ employees to better serve the interests of 
the community and 
 create awareness 
and engagement 
among employees. 
During 2022, this 
group was composed 
of 245 
members and 
performed 6 
 activities 
within 
the 
organization 
and 
community. 
Furthermore, 
during 
2022 
the 
following 
two 
additional 
ERGs 
were 
launched: 
 Women s 
and 
Functional 
Diversity. 
Popular 
also 
supports 
victims 
of 
gender-based 
violence 
and 
has 
a 
Gender 
and 
Domestic 
 Violence Policy, which grants a paid 15-day leave due to gender or domestic 
violence, stalking and sexual harassment. 
 Employee Experience 

 Popular aims to 
provide an excellent
 employee experience that 
inspires its employees to 
provide customers and 
communities with 
 the best 
service. To 
understand its 
employees experience, the 
Corporation conducts 
anonymous pulse 
and engagement 
surveys 
 (including the 
Great Place 
to 
Work survey) 
as well 
as 
an exit 
survey to 
identify areas 
of 
opportunity and 
set 
and monitor 
action 
 plans. 
The 
2022 
employee satisfaction 
scores 
increased 2 
points from 
2020 
and 
5 
points 
since 
2016. 
We 
seek 
to 
continuously 
 measure and improve the employee experience with aims to increase employee productivity while contributing to enhance customer 
 satisfaction and improve business results. 
 The 
Corporation 
capitalizes 
on 
an 
interactive 
dashboard 
that 
encompasses 
data 
surrounding 
different 
people-related 
topics 
to 
 support 
the 
people 
strategy, 
data-driven 
decision-making 
and 
environmental, 
social 
and 
governance ESG 
monitoring. 
The 
 dashboard provides 
senior management 
with visibility 
over people 
metrics such 
as workforce 
demographics, hiring, 
turnover, 
and 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. 

13 
 As of year-end 2022, our turnover rate was 10.8 , improving 1.9 percentage points since 2021. Additionally, voluntary turnover rate 
 was 8.8 , improving 2.3 percentage points since 2021.Throughout 2022, the Corporation saw 
a stabilization in turnover, which 
had 
 been 
increasing 
for 
the 
past 
seven 
quarters. 
The 
dashboard 
metrics, 
such 
as 
turnover, 
help 
shape 
our 
attraction 
and 
retention 
 strategy.

 Regulation and Supervision 
 Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Popular, Popular North America 
 PNA 
and 
their 
respective 
subsidiaries. 
Such 
laws 
and 
regulations 
are 
continually 
under 
review 
by 
Congress 
and 
state 
 legislatures 
and 
federal 
and 
state 
regulatory 
agencies. 
Any 
change 
in 
the 
laws 
and 
regulations 
applicable 
to 
Popular 
and 
its 
 subsidiaries could have a material effect on the 
business of Popular and its subsidiaries. We will continue to 
assess our businesses 
 and risk management and compliance practices 
to conform to developments in the regulatory environment. 
 General
 Popular and 
PNA are 
bank holding 
companies subject 
to consolidated 
supervision and 
regulation by 
the Federal 
Reserve Board 
 under 
the 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act 
of 
1956 
(as 
amended, 
the 
 BHC 
Act ). 
BPPR 
and 
PB 
are 
subject 
to 
supervision 
and 
 examination by applicable 
federal and state 
banking agencies including, 
in the 
case of BPPR, 
the Federal Reserve 
Board and the 
 Office of 
the Commissioner 
of Financial 
Institutions of 
Puerto Rico 
(the Office 
of the 
Commissioner ), and, in 
the case 
of PB, 
the 
 Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
and 
the 
New 
York 
State 
Department 
of 
Financial 
Services 
(the 
 NYSDFS ). 
Popular s 
broker-dealer 
/ 
 investment adviser 
subsidiary, 
Popular Securities, 
LLC PS 
and investment 
advisor subsidiary 
Popular Asset 
Management LLC 
 PAM 
are subject 
to 
regulation by 
the SEC, 
the Financial 
Industry 
Regulatory Authority FINRA ), and 
the Securities 
Investor 
 Protection Corporation, among others. Other of our non-bank subsidiaries conduct reinsurance and 
insurance producer and agency 
 activities, which are 
subject to other 
federal, state and 
Puerto Rico laws 
and regulations as 
well as licensing 
and regulation by 
the 
 Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and, 
for one insurance agency subsidiary, the NYSDFS. 
 Enhanced Prudential Standards 
 Under 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Wall 
Street 
Reform 
and 
Consumer 
Protection 
Act 
(the 
 Dodd-Frank 
Act ), 
as 
modified 
by 
the 
 Economic 
Growth, 
Regulatory 
Relief, 
and 
Consumer 
Protection 
Act 
and 
the 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
2019 
 Tailoring 
Rules, 
 banking 
organizations are 
categorized based 
on status 
as 
a U.S. 
G-SIB, 
size 
and four 
other risk-based 
indicators. Among 
bank 
 holding companies with 100 
billion or more in 
total consolidated assets, the 
most stringent standards apply 
to U.S. G-SIBs, 
which 
 are subject to Category I standards and the 
least stringent standards apply to Category IV organizations, which have between 100 
 billion and 250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than 75 billion in all four 
other risk-based indicators and which are also 
 not U.S. G-SIBs. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more are subject to risk committee and risk 
 management requirements. As of December 31, 2022, Popular 
had total consolidated assets of 67.6 billion. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 BPPR and 
PB are 
subject to 
restrictions that 
limit the 
amount of 
extensions of 
credit and 
certain other 
 covered transactions 
(as 
 defined in Section 
23A of the 
Federal Reserve Act) 
between BPPR or PB, 
on the one 
hand, and Popular, 
PNA or any 
of our other 
 non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, 
and that impose collateralization requirements on 
such credit extensions. A bank 
may 
 not engage 
in any 
covered transaction if 
the aggregate amount 
of the bank s 
covered transactions with 
that affiliate 
would exceed 

14 
 10 of 
the bank s 
capital stock 
and surplus 
or the 
aggregate amount 
of the 
bank s covered 
transactions with 
all affiliates 
would 
 exceed 
20 
of 
the 
bank s 
capital 
stock 
and 
surplus. 
In 
addition, 
any 
transaction 
between 
BPPR 
or 
PB, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
 Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the 
other, is required to be carried out on an arm s length basis. 
 Source of Financial Strength
 The 
Dodd-Frank Act 
requires bank 
holding companies, 
such 
as Popular 
and 
PNA, to 
act 
as 
a source 
of 
financial 
and 
 managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Popular 
and PNA are expected to commit resources 
to support their subsidiary banks, 
 including at times when Popular 
and PNA may not be 
in a financial position to 
provide such resources. Any capital 
loans by a bank 
 holding company 
to any 
of its 
subsidiary depository 
institutions are 
subordinated in 
right of 
payment to 
depositors and 
to certain 
 other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the 
event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, 
any commitment 
 by 
the 
bank 
holding 
company 
to 
a 
federal 
banking 
agency 
to 
maintain 
the 
capital 
of 
a 
subsidiary 
depository 
institution 
will 
be 
 assumed by 
the bankruptcy 
trustee and 
entitled to 
a priority 
of payment. 
BPPR and 
PB are 
currently the 
only insured 
depository 
 institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. 
 Resolution Planning 
 A 
 bank holding 
company with 
 250 billion 
or more 
in total 
consolidated assets 
(or that 
is a 
Category III 
firm based 
on 
 certain risk-based indicators described in the Tailoring 
Rules) is required to report periodically to the 
FDIC and the Federal Reserve 
 Board 
such 
company s 
plan 
for 
its 
rapid 
and 
orderly 
resolution 
in 
the 
event 
of 
material 
financial 
distress 
or 
failure. 
In 
addition, 
 insured depository institutions with total 
assets of 50 billion or 
more are required to 
submit to the FDIC 
periodic contingency plans 
 for resolution 
in the 
event of 
the institution s 
failure. In 
June 2021, 
the FDIC 
issued a 
Statement on 
Resolution Plans 
for Insured 
 Depository Institutions, 
which, among 
other things, 
establishes a three-year 
filing cycle 
for banks 
with 100 
billion or 
more in 
total 
 assets and provides details regarding the content 
that filers will be expected to prepare. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Popular, 
PNA, BPPR and PB s total assets were below 
the thresholds for applicability of these 
 rules. 
 FDIC Insurance
 Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of 
 the 
FDIC, 
and 
BPPR 
and 
PB 
are 
subject 
to 
FDIC 
deposit 
insurance 
assessments 
to 
maintain 
the 
DIF. 
Deposit 
insurance 
 assessments are 
based on 
the average 
consolidated total 
assets of 
the insured 
depository institution 
minus the 
average tangible 
 equity of the institution during the assessment period. For larger 
depository institutions with over 10 billion in assets, 
such as BPPR 
 and PB, the FDIC uses a scorecard methodology, which considers CAMELS ratings, among other 
measures, that seeks to capture 
 both the probability that an individual large institution will 
fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF 
if such a failure occurs. The 
 FDIC has the ability 
to make discretionary adjustments to the 
total score based upon significant 
risk factors that are not 
adequately 
 captured in the calculations. The initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from 3 to 30 
 basis points on an annualized basis. 
After the effect of 
potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could 
range 
 from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized 
basis. 
 On October 18, 
2022, the FDIC finalized 
a rule that 
would increase initial 
base deposit insurance assessment 
rates by 2 
 basis 
points, 
beginning 
with 
the 
first 
quarterly 
assessment 
period 
of 
2023. 
The 
FDIC, 
as 
required 
under 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
 Insurance 
Act FDIA ), 
established 
a 
plan 
in 
September 
2020 
to 
restore 
the 
DIF 
reserve 
ratio 
to 
meet 
or 
exceed 
the 
statutory 
 minimum of 
1.35 percent 
within eight 
years. The 
increased assessment 
is intended 
to improve 
the likelihood 
that the 
DIF reserve 
 ratio would reach the required minimum by the 
statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
had 
a 
DIF 
average 
total 
asset 
less 
average 
tangible 
equity 
assessment 
base 
of 
 approximately 65 billion. 
 Brokered Deposits
 The FDIA 
and regulations 
adopted thereunder 
restrict the 
use of 
brokered deposits 
and the 
rate of 
interest payable 
on 
 deposits for 
institutions that 
are 
less than 
well capitalized. 
There are 
no such 
restrictions on 
a bank 
that 
is well 
capitalized (see 
 Prompt 
Corrective 
Action 
below 
for 
a 
description 
of 
the 
standard 
of 
 well 
capitalized ). 
Popular 
does 
not 
believe 
the 
brokered 
 deposits regulations have had or will have a 
material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and PB. 
 Capital Adequacy
 Popular, Popular, 
BPPR and PB 
are each required 
to comply 
with applicable capital 
adequacy standards established 
by 

15 
 the 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
(the 
 Capital 
Rules ), 
which 
implement 
the 
Basel 
III 
framework 
set 
forth 
by 
Basel 
Committee 
on 
 Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee as 
well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. 
 Among other 
matters, the 
Capital Rules: 
(i) impose 
a capital 
measure called 
 Common Equity 
Tier 
1 CET1 
and the 
 related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 
 capital instruments meeting 
certain revised requirements; 
and (iii) mandate 
that most deductions/adjustments to 
regulatory capital 
 measures be made 
to CET1 
and not to 
the other components 
of capital. 
Under the Capital 
Rules, for most 
banking organizations, 
 including 
Popular, 
the 
most 
common 
form 
of 
Additional 
Tier 
1 
capital 
is 
non-cumulative 
perpetual preferred 
stock 
and 
the 
most 
 common form of Tier 
2 capital is subordinated notes and 
a portion of the 
allocation for loan and lease losses, 
in each case, subject 
 to the Capital Rules specific requirements. 
 Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum 
capital ratios are: 
 4.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
 6.0 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted 
assets; 
 8.0 Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 
 4 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported 
on consolidated financial statements (known 
as the 
 leverage ratio ). 
 The Capital Rules also impose 
a capital conservation buffer, 
composed entirely of CET1, on top 
of these minimum risk-
 weighted 
asset 
ratios. The 
capital 
conservation 
buffer 
is 
designed 
to 
absorb 
losses 
during 
periods 
of 
economic stress. 
Banking 
 institutions 
with 
a 
ratio 
of 
CET1 
to 
risk-weighted 
assets 
above 
the 
minimum 
but 
below 
the 
capital 
conservation 
buffer 
will 
face 
 constraints on 
dividends, equity repurchases 
and compensation based 
on the 
amount of 
the shortfall and 
eligible retained 
income 
 (that is, 
four quarter trailing 
net income, net 
of distributions 
and tax 
effects not 
reflected in net 
income). Thus, Popular, 
BPPR and 
 PB are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of 
(i) 
 CET1 to risk-weighted assets 
of at least 7 , 
(ii) Tier 1 
capital to risk-weighted assets of 
at least 8.5 , and 
(iii) Total 
capital to risk-
 weighted assets of at least 10.5 . 
 In addition, under 
prior risk-based capital rules, 
the effects of 
accumulated other comprehensive income 
or loss AOCI 
 items included in stockholders 
equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities 
held in the available 
for sale portfolio) under 
U.S. 
 GAAP were reversed 
for the 
purposes of determining 
regulatory capital ratios. 
Pursuant to the 
Capital Rules, the 
effects of certain 
 AOCI items 
are not 
excluded; however, 
non-advanced approaches 
banking organizations, 
including Popular, 
BPPR and 
PB, may 
 make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Popular, 
BPPR and PB have made this election in order to 
 avoid significant 
variations in 
the level 
of capital 
depending upon 
the impact 
of interest 
rate fluctuations 
on the 
fair value 
of their 
 securities portfolios. 

 The 
Capital 
Rules 
preclude certain 
hybrid 
securities, such 
as 
trust 
preferred 
securities, from 
inclusion 
in 
bank 
holding 
 companies Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities no 
longer included in Popular s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a 
 component of 
Tier 2 capital. 
Popular has 
not issued 
any trust 
preferred securities since 
May 19, 
2010. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
 Popular has 
 193 million 
of trust 
preferred securities 
outstanding which 
no longer 
qualify for 
Tier 
1 capital 
treatment, but 
instead 
 qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment.
 The Capital 
Rules also 
provide for 
a number 
of deductions 
from and 
adjustments to 
CET1. 
Non-advanced approaches 
 banking organizations 
are subject 
to 
rules that 
provide for 
simplified capital 
requirements relating 
to the 
threshold deductions 
for 
 certain 
mortgage 
servicing 
assets, 
deferred 
tax 
assets, 
investments 
in 
the 
capital 
of 
unconsolidated 
financial 
institutions 
and 
 inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital. 
 Failure 
to 
meet 
capital 
guidelines 
could 
subject 
Popular 
and 
its 
depository 
institution 
subsidiaries 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
 enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC 
and to certain restrictions on our business. Refer 
 to Prompt Corrective Action below for further 
discussion. 
 In 
December 2017, 
the Basel 
Committee published 
standards that 
it 
described as 
the finalization 
of the 
Basel III 
post-
 crisis regulatory 
reforms. Among other 
things, these 
standards revise 
the Basel 
Committee s standardized approach 
for credit 
risk 
 (including 
by 
recalibrating 
risk 
weights 
and 
introducing 
new 
capital 
requirements 
for 
certain 
 unconditionally 
cancellable 
 commitments, such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The 

16 
 Basel framework 
contemplates that 
these standards 
will generally be 
effective on 
January 1, 
2023, with 
an aggregate 
output floor 
 phasing in through January 1, 2028. The federal 
bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards. Under 
 the 
current 
U.S. 
capital 
rules, 
operational 
risk 
capital 
requirements 
and 
a 
capital 
floor 
apply 
only 
to 
advanced 
approaches 
 institutions, and 
not to Popular, 
BPPR and 
PB. The impact 
of these standards 
on us 
will depend on 
the manner 
in which they 
are 
 implemented by the federal bank regulators. 
 In 
December 
2018, 
the 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
approved 
a 
final 
rule 
modifying 
their 
regulatory 
capital 
rules 
and 
 providing an 
option to 
phase in 
over a 
period of 
three years 
the day-one 
regulatory capital 
effects of 
the Current 
Expected Credit 
 Loss CECL model 
of ASU 2016-13. 
The final 
rule also revised 
the agencies 
other rules to 
reflect the update 
to the 
accounting 
 standards. Popular has availed itself 
of the option to 
phase in over a period 
of three years the 
day one effects on 
regulatory capital 
 from the 
adoption of 
CECL. In 
2020, federal 
bank regulators 
adopted a 
rule that 
allowed banking 
organizations to 
elect to 
delay 
 temporarily 
the 
estimated 
effects 
of 
adopting 
CECL 
on 
regulatory 
capital 
until 
January 
2022 
and 
subsequently 
to 
phase 
in 
the 
 effects through January 2025. Under the rule, during 2020 and 
2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital reflects the change in retained 
 earnings upon 
adoption of CECL 
at January 
1, 2020, plus 
25 of the 
increase in 
the allowance for 
credit losses since 
January 1, 
 2020. 
 Refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K., Note 21 and Table 9 of 
Management s Discussion and 
 Analysis for the capital ratios of Popular, BPPR and PB under Basel III. Refer 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 
 10-K Note 3 for more information regarding CECL. 

 Prompt Corrective Action
 The 
FDIA 
requires, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
to 
take 
prompt 
corrective 
action 
in 
respect 
of 
 insured 
depository 
institutions 
that 
do 
not 
meet 
minimum 
capital 
requirements. 
The 
FDIA 
establishes 
five 
capital 
tiers: 
 well 
 capitalized, 
 adequately 
capitalized, 
 undercapitalized, 
 significantly 
undercapitalized, 
and 
 critically 
undercapitalized . 
A 
 depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its 
capital levels compare with various relevant capital 
measures and certain 
 other factors. 
 An insured 
depository institution will 
be deemed 
to be 
(i) well 
capitalized if 
the institution 
has a 
total risk-based 
capital 
 ratio of 10.0 or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 
or greater, a Tier 1 
risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, and a leverage 
 ratio of 5.0 or 
greater, and is 
not subject to any order 
or written directive by 
any such regulatory authority to 
meet and maintain a 
 specific capital level for any capital 
measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if the institution 
has a total risk-based capital ratio 
of 8.0 
 or greater, a 
CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 
or greater, a 
Tier 1 risk-based capital 
ratio of 6.0 or greater, 
and a leverage ratio of 
4.0 
 or greater 
and is 
not well 
capitalized (iii) 
 undercapitalized if 
the institution 
has a 
total risk-based 
capital ratio 
that is 
less than 
 8.0 , a CET1 capital 
ratio less than 4.5 , 
a Tier 1 
risk-based capital ratio of 
less than 6.0 or 
a leverage ratio of 
less than 4.0 ; 
 (iv) significantly 
undercapitalized if 
the institution 
has a 
total risk-based 
capital ratio 
of less 
than 6.0 , 
a CET1 
capital ratio 
less 
 than 3 , a Tier 
1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 or 
a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 ; 
and (v) critically undercapitalized 
 if 
the 
institution s 
tangible 
equity 
is 
equal 
to 
or 
less 
than 
2.0 
of 
average 
quarterly 
tangible 
assets. 
An 
institution 
may 
be 
 downgraded to, or deemed 
to be in, a 
capital category that is 
lower than indicated by 
its capital ratios if 
it is determined to 
be in an 
 unsafe 
or 
unsound 
condition 
or 
if 
it 
receives 
an 
unsatisfactory 
examination 
rating 
with 
respect 
to 
certain 
matters. 
An 
insured 
 depository institution s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action 
regulations, and the 
 capital category 
may not 
constitute an 
accurate representation 
of the 
institution s overall 
financial condition 
or prospects 
for other 
 purposes. 
 The FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of 
a 
 dividend) or 
paying any 
management fee to 
its holding 
company, if 
the depository 
institution would thereafter 
be undercapitalized. 
 Undercapitalized 
depository 
institutions 
are 
subject 
to 
restrictions 
on 
borrowing 
from 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
System. 
In 
addition, 
 undercapitalized 
depository 
institutions 
are 
subject 
to 
growth 
limitations 
and 
are 
required 
to 
submit 
capital 
restoration 
plans. 
A 
 depository institution s 
holding company must 
guarantee the capital 
restoration plan, up 
to an 
amount equal to 
the lesser 
of 5 of 
 the 
depository 
institution s 
assets 
at 
the 
time 
it 
becomes 
undercapitalized 
or 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
capital 
deficiency, 
when 
the 
 institution fails to comply with the 
plan. The federal banking agencies may 
not accept a capital restoration plan without 
determining, 
 among other things, 
that the plan 
is based 
on realistic assumptions 
and is 
likely to succeed 
in restoring the 
depository institution s 
 capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an 
acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is 
significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly 
undercapitalized 
depository 
institutions 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
a 
number 
of 
requirements 
and 
restrictions, 

17 
 including orders to 
sell sufficient voting 
stock to become 
adequately capitalized, requirements to 
reduce total assets 
and cessation 
 of receipt 
of deposits 
from correspondent 
banks. Critically 
undercapitalized depository 
institutions are 
subject to 
appointment of 
a 
 receiver or conservator. 
 The capital-based prompt 
corrective action provisions 
of the FDIA 
apply to 
the FDIC-insured depository 
institutions such 
 as 
BPPR 
and 
PB, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
directly 
applicable 
to 
holding 
companies 
such 
as 
Popular 
and 
PNA, 
which 
control 
such 
 institutions. As of December 31, 2022, 
both BPPR and PB were well capitalized. 
 Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases 
 The 
principal 
sources 
of 
funding 
for 
Popular 
and 
PNA 
have 
included 
dividends 
received 
from 
their 
banking 
and 
non-
 banking subsidiaries, asset sales 
and proceeds from 
the issuance of 
debt and equity. 
Various statutory 
provisions limit the amount 
 of 
dividends an 
insured depository 
institution may 
pay to 
its 
holding company 
without regulatory 
approval. A 
member bank 
must 
 obtain the approval of the 
Federal Reserve Board for any 
dividend, if the total of 
all dividends declared by the 
member bank during 
 the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, 
combined with its retained net income for the preceding two 
 years, after 
considering those 
years dividend 
activity, 
less any 
required transfers to 
surplus or 
to a 
fund for 
the retirement 
of any 
 preferred stock. During the year 
ended December 31, 2022, BPPR declared 
cash dividends of 450 million, 
a portion of which was 
 used by 
Popular for 
the payments 
of the 
cash dividends 
on its 
outstanding common 
stock and 
 231 million 
in accelerated 
stock 
 repurchases. 
At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
BPPR 
needed 
to 
obtain 
prior 
approval 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
before 
declaring 
a 
 dividend in excess of 53 million due to its declared 
dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the three year s ended 
 December 31, 2022. In 
addition, a member bank 
may not declare 
or pay a 
dividend in an 
amount greater than its 
undivided profits 
 as 
reported 
in 
its 
Report of 
Condition and 
Income, 
unless the 
member 
bank 
has 
received the 
approval 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
 Board. A 
member bank 
also may 
not permit 
any portion 
of its 
permanent capital to 
be withdrawn 
unless the 
withdrawal has 
been 
 approved by 
the Federal 
Reserve Board. Pursuant 
to these 
requirements, PB may 
not declare 
or pay 
a dividend 
without the 
prior 
 approval of the Federal Reserve Board and 
the NYSDFS. 
 It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common 
stock only out 
 of net 
income available to 
common shareholders 
over the past 
year and 
only if 
the prospective rate 
of earnings retention 
appears 
 consistent with the organization s current and 
expected future capital needs, asset quality 
and overall financial condition. Moreover, 
 under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank 
holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the 
 capital of depository 
institution subsidiaries or that 
may undermine the bank 
holding company s ability to 
be a source 
of strength to 
 its 
banking subsidiaries. 
Federal Reserve 
policy 
also 
provides that 
a 
bank 
holding company 
should 
inform 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
 reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that 
exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is 
being paid or 
 that could result in a material adverse change 
to the bank holding company s capital structure. 

 The 
Federal Reserve 
Board 
also restricts 
the 
ability of 
banking 
organizations to 
conduct stock 
repurchases. In 
certain 
 circumstances, a banking organization s repurchases 
of its common stock may 
be subject to a 
prior approval or notice 
requirement 
 under other regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve. Any redemption or 
repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt is 
 subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
 Subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation 
organized under the 
 laws 
of the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico 
are subject 
to 
a withholding 
tax 
of 10 
instead of 
the 30 
applied to 
other foreign 
 corporations. Accordingly, dividends from current or accumulated earnings and profits paid 
by PNA to Popular, Inc. sourced from the 
 U.S. operations of PB are subject to a 10 
tax withholding. 
 Refer to 
Part II, 
Item 5, 
 Market for 
Registrant s Common 
Equity, 
Related Stockholder 
Matters and 
Issuer Purchases 
of 
 Equity Securities for further information on Popular s 
distribution of dividends and repurchases of equity 
securities. 
 See 
 Puerto 
Rico 
Regulation 
below 
for 
a 
description 
of 
certain 
restrictions 
on 
BPPR s 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends 
under 
 Puerto Rico law. 
 Interstate Branching
 The Dodd-Frank 
Act amended 
the Riegle-Neal 
Interstate Banking 
and Branching 
Efficiency Act 
of 1994 
(the Interstate 
 Banking 
Act 
to 
authorize 
national 
banks 
and 
state 
banks 
to 
branch 
interstate 
through 
 de 
novo
 
branches. For 
purposes 
of 
the 
 Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state 
 banks. 

18 
 Activities and Acquisitions
 In general, the BHC Act limits the activities 
permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing 
 or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to 
 be 
properly 
incidental 
thereto. 
A 
company 
who 
meets 
management 
and 
capital 
standards 
and 
whose 
subsidiary 
depository 
 institutions meet management, 
capital and 
Community Reinvestment Act CRA standards may 
elect to 
be treated 
as a 
financial 
 holding company 
and engage 
in a 
substantially broader 
range of 
nonbanking financial 
activities, including 
securities underwriting 
 and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant 
banking investments in nonfinancial companies. 
 In order for a bank holding company to elect to be treated as a financial 
holding company, (i) all of its depository institution 
 subsidiaries 
must 
be 
well capitalized 
(as described 
above) 
and 
well managed 
and 
(ii) 
it 
must 
file a 
declaration with 
the Federal 
 Reserve Board that it elects to be a financial holding 
company. As noted above, a bank 
holding company electing to be a financial 
 holding company must itself be and remain 
well capitalized and well managed. The Federal Reserve Board s 
regulations applicable 
 to bank holding companies separately define 
 well capitalized for bank holding companies, 
such as Popular, 
to require maintaining 
 a tier 1 capital 
ratio of at least 
6 and a total capital 
ratio of at least 10 . 
Popular and PNA have elected 
to be treated as 
financial 
 holding 
companies. 
A 
depository 
institution 
is 
deemed 
to 
be 
 well 
managed 
if, 
at 
its 
most 
recent 
inspection, 
examination 
or 
 subsequent review 
by the 
appropriate federal banking 
agency (or 
the appropriate state 
banking agency), the 
depository institution 
 received 
at 
least 
a 
 satisfactory 
composite 
rating 
and 
at 
least 
a 
 satisfactory 
rating 
for 
the 
management 
component 
of 
the 
 composite 
rating. 
If, 
after 
becoming 
a 
financial 
holding 
company, 
the 
company 
fails 
to 
continue 
to 
meet 
any 
of 
the 
capital 
or 
 management requirements 
for financial 
holding company 
status, the 
company 
must 
enter into 
a confidential 
agreement with 
the 
 Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
to 
comply 
with 
all 
applicable capital 
and 
management 
requirements. 
If 
the 
company 
does 
not 
return 
to 
 compliance 
within 
180 
days, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
may 
extend 
the 
agreement 
or 
may 
order 
the 
company 
to 
divest 
its 
 subsidiary banks or the 
company may discontinue, or 
divest investments in companies 
engaged in, activities permissible only 
for a 
 bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial 
holding company. In addition, if a depository institution subsidiary 
 controlled by a financial holding company does not 
maintain a CRA rating of at least satisfactory, the financial holding company 
will 
 be subject to restrictions on certain new activities 
and acquisitions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board 
may in certain circumstances limit 
our ability to conduct 
activities and make acquisitions that 
 would otherwise be permissible for 
a financial holding company. 
Furthermore, a financial holding company must obtain 
prior written 
 approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring a nonbank company with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. 
 In addition, we 
are required to 
obtain prior Federal 
Reserve Board approval 
before engaging in 
certain banking and 
other financial 
 activities both in the United States and abroad. 
 The Volcker 
Rule adopted 
as part 
of the 
Dodd-Frank Act 
restricts the 
ability of 
Popular and 
its subsidiaries, 
including 
 BPPR and PB as 
well as non-banking subsidiaries, to 
sponsor or invest in 
 covered funds, including private funds, 
or to engage in 
 certain types 
of proprietary 
trading. Popular 
and its 
subsidiaries generally 
do not 
engage in 
the businesses 
subject to 
the Volcker 
 Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our 
operations. 

 Anti-Money Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act
 A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in 
recent years has been aimed at combating money 
 laundering and 
terrorist financing. 
The USA 
PATRIOT 
Act of 
2001 (the 
 USA PATRIOT 
Act strengthened 
the ability 
of the 
U.S. 
 government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title 
III of the USA 
 PATRIOT 
Act imposed 
significant compliance 
and due 
diligence obligations, 
created new 
crimes and 
penalties and 
expanded the 
 extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act s requirements 
 could have serious legal and reputational consequences 
for the institution. 
 The 
Anti-Money 
Laundering 
Act 
of 
2020 AMLA ), 
which 
amended 
the 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
(the 
 BSA ), 
is 
intended 
to 
 comprehensively 
reform 
and 
modernize 
U.S. 
anti-money 
laundering 
laws. 
Among 
other 
things, 
the 
AMLA 
codifies 
a 
risk-based 
 approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to 
promulgate 
 priorities 
for 
anti-money 
laundering 
and 
countering 
the 
financing 
of 
terrorism 
policy; 
requires 
the 
development 
of 
standards 
for 
 testing technology and 
internal processes for BSA 
compliance; expands enforcement- 
and investigation-related authority, 
including 
 a 
significant 
expansion 
in 
the 
available 
sanctions 
for 
certain 
BSA 
violations; 
and 
expands 
BSA 
whistleblower 
incentives 
and 
 protections. Many of 
the statutory provisions 
in the AMLA 
will require additional 
rulemakings, reports and 
other measures, and 
the 
 impact 
of 
the 
AMLA 
will 
depend on, 
among 
other 
things, 
rulemaking and 
implementation guidance. 
In 
June 
2021, 
the 
Financial 

19 
 Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of 
the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, 
issued the priorities for anti-money laundering 
and 
 countering the 
financing of 
terrorism policy 
required under AMLA. 
The priorities 
include: corruption, cybercrime, 
terrorist financing, 
 fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and 
proliferation financing. 
 Federal regulators 
regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money 
Laundering and sanctions 
compliance to 
enhance their 
adequacy 
 and effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations 
and related remedial actions have been 
increasing. 
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The 
CRA 
requires 
banks 
to 
help 
serve 
the 
credit 
needs 
of 
their 
communities, 
including 
extending 
credit 
to 
low- 
and 
 moderate-income individuals 
and geographies. 
Should 
Popular 
or our 
bank 
subsidiaries 
fail 
to 
serve 
adequately 
the community, 
 potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate offices or branches, add subsidiaries 
 and affiliates, expand into 
new financial activities and merge 
with or purchase other financial 
institutions. In May 2022, the 
Office of 
 the Comptroller 
of the 
Currency OCC ), 
the Federal 
Reserve Board, 
and the 
FDIC jointly 
issued a 
proposed rule 
to 
modernize 
 federal banking 
agencies CRA 
regulations. The 
proposed rule 
would adjust 
CRA evaluations 
based on 
bank size 
and type, 
with 
 many of the proposed changes applying only to banks 
with over 2 billion in assets and several applying 
only to banks with over 10 
 billion in assets, 
such as Popular. 
The effects on 
Popular of any 
potential change to the 
CRA rules will 
depend on the final 
form of 
 any Federal Reserve rulemaking. 
 Interchange Fees Regulation
 The Federal Reserve Board 
has established standards for 
debit card interchange fees 
and prohibited network exclusivity 
 arrangements and routing restrictions. The 
maximum permissible interchange fee that 
an issuer may receive 
for an electronic debit 
 transaction is 
the sum 
of 
21 cents 
per transaction 
and 5 
basis points 
multiplied by 
the value 
of 
the transaction. 
Additionally, 
the 
 Federal Reserve 
Board allows 
for an 
upward adjustment 
of 
no more 
than 1 
cent 
to 
an issuer s 
debit card 
interchange fee 
if the 
 issuer develops and implements policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention 
standards.
 Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
 The Consumer 
Financial Protection 
Bureau (the 
 CFPB supervises 
 covered persons 
(broadly defined 
to include 
any 
 person offering or 
providing a consumer financial 
product or service and 
any affiliated service 
provider) for compliance with 
federal 
 consumer financial laws. The CFPB 
also has the broad power 
to prescribe rules applicable to 
a covered person or service 
provider 
 identifying 
as 
unlawful, 
unfair, 
deceptive, 
or 
abusive 
acts 
or 
practices 
in 
connection 
with 
any 
transaction 
with 
a 
consumer 
for 
a 
 consumer financial product or service, or the offering of 
a consumer financial product or service. We are subject to examination and 
 regulation by the CFPB. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 The 
U.S. 
Treasury 
Department 
Office 
of 
Foreign 
Assets 
Control OFAC 
administers 
economic 
sanctions 
that 
affect 
 transactions 
with 
designated 
foreign 
countries, 
nationals 
and 
others. 
The 
OFAC-administered 
sanctions 
targeting 
countries 
take 
 many 
different 
forms. 
Generally, 
however, 
they 
contain 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
following 
elements: 
(i) 
restrictions 
on 
trade 
with 
or 
 investment in a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking 
of assets in which the government of the 
sanctioned country or other specially 
 designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting 
transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including 
property in the United 
 States or the possession or control of U.S. 
persons outside of the United States). Blocked assets (e.g., property 
and bank deposits) 
 cannot 
be 
paid 
out, 
withdrawn, set 
off 
or 
transferred 
in 
any 
manner without 
a 
license 
from 
OFAC. 
Failure 
to 
comply 
with these 
 sanctions could have serious legal and reputational 
consequences. 
 Protection of Customer Personal Information and 
Cybersecurity 
 The privacy 
provisions of 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
of 1999 
generally prohibit financial 
institutions, including 
us, from 
 disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to 
third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 
 unless 
customers 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
opt 
out 
of 
the 
disclosure. 
The 
Fair 
Credit 
Reporting 
Act 
restricts 
information 
sharing 
 among affiliates for marketing purposes and governs 
the use and provision of information to consumer 
reporting agencies. 
 The federal 
banking regulators have 
also issued guidance 
and proposed rules 
regarding cybersecurity that 
are intended 
 to 
enhance cyber 
risk management 
standards among 
financial institutions. 
A 
financial institution 
is expected 
to 
establish lines 
of 
 defense 
and 
to 
maintain 
risk 
management 
processes 
that 
are 
designed 
to 
address 
the 
risk 
posed 
by 
compromised 
customer 
 credentials. A 
financial institution s 
management is 
expected to 
maintain sufficient 
business continuity 
planning processes 
for the 
 rapid 
recovery, 
resumption 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
institution s 
operations 
after 
a 
cyber-attack 
involving 
destructive 
malware. 
A 
 financial 
institution 
is 
also 
expected 
to 
develop 
appropriate 
processes 
to 
enable 
recovery 
of 
data 
and 
business 
operations 
and 

20 
 address rebuilding 
network capabilities 
and restoring 
data if 
the institution 
or its 
critical service 
providers fall 
victim to 
this type 
of 
 cyber-attack. If 
we fail 
to observe 
the regulatory 
guidance, we 
could be 
subject to 
various regulatory 
sanctions, including financial 
 penalties. In November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory 
agencies issued a final rule requiring banking 
organizations, including 
 Popular, 
PNA, 
BPPR and 
PB, 
to 
notify their 
primary federal 
banking regulator 
within 
36 hours 
of 
determining that 
a notification 
 incident 
has 
occurred. 
A 
notification 
incident 
is 
a 
 computer-security 
incident 
that 
has 
materially 
disrupted 
or 
degraded, 
or 
is 
 reasonably likely 
to materially 
disrupt or 
degrade, the 
banking organization s 
ability to 
deliver services 
to 
a material 
portion of 
its 
 customer base, 
jeopardize the viability 
of key 
operations of the 
banking organization, or 
impact the stability 
of the 
financial sector. 
 The final rule also requires specific and immediate 
notifications by bank service providers that 
become aware of similar incidents. 
 State and foreign regulators 
have also been increasingly active 
in implementing privacy and cybersecurity 
standards and 
 regulations. Several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and 
 providing detailed requirements with respect to these 
programs, including data encryption requirements. In New York, 
the NYSDFS 
 requires 
financial 
institutions 
regulated 
by 
the 
NYSDFS, 
including 
PB, 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
(i) 
establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
 cybersecurity program designed 
to enhance the 
confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of 
their information systems; 
(ii) implement 
 and maintain a written 
cyber security policy setting forth 
policies and procedures for the 
protection of their information systems 
and 
 nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief 
Information Security Officer. 
 In 
March 
2022, 
the 
SEC 
proposed 
new 
rules 
that 
would 
require 
registrants, 
such 
as 
Popular, 
to 
(i) 
report 
material 
 cybersecurity incidents on 
Form 8-K, 
(ii) include updated 
disclosure in Forms 
10-K and 
10-Q of 
previously disclosed cybersecurity 
 incidents, 
and 
disclose 
previously 
undisclosed, 
individually 
immaterial 
incidents 
when 
a 
determination 
is 
made 
that 
they 
have 
 become material on an aggregated basis, (iii) disclose cybersecurity policies and procedures and governance practices, including at 
 the board and management levels, in Form 10-K 
and (iv) disclose the board of directors 
cybersecurity expertise. 
 Many states and foreign 
governments have also recently implemented or 
modified their data breach notification 
and data 
 privacy 
requirements. The 
California Consumer 
Privacy Act CCPA 
imposes privacy 
compliance obligations 
with regard 
to 
the 
 collection, 
use 
and 
disclosure of 
personal 
information of 
California residents, 
and the 
November 2020 
amendment to 
the 
CCPA 
 creates the California Privacy Protection Agency, a watchdog privacy agency, and further expands the scope of businesses covered 
 by the law 
and certain rights relating 
to personal information. The 
substantive obligations under the 
2020 amendment to the 
CCPA 
 became effective 
on January 
1, 2023. 
In European 
Union, the 
General Data 
Protection Regulation heightens 
privacy compliance 
 obligations 
and 
imposes 
strict 
standards 
for 
reporting 
data 
breaches. 
We 
expect 
this 
trend 
to 
continue 
and 
are 
continually 
 monitoring developments in the jurisdictions in which 
we operate. 
 See 
 Puerto 
Rico 
Regulation 
below 
for 
a 
description 
of 
legislations 
and 
regulations 
on 
information 
privacy 
and 
 cybersecurity in Puerto Rico. 
 Climate-Related Financial Risks 

 State 
and 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
have 
become 
increasingly 
focused 
on 
matters 
regarding climate 
change 
and 
its 
 associated risks. 
In 2021, the 
OCC proposed principles to 
provide for a framework 
for the management of 
climate-related risks for 
 financial institutions and in 2022, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS each proposed principles or guidance with 
 respect to 
the management 
of climate-related 
risks for 
financial institutions. Additionally, 
in 2022, 
the SEC 
proposed rule 
changes 
 that 
would 
require 
registrants, 
such 
as 
Popular, 
to 
disclose 
information 
about 
climate-related 
risks 
and 
certain 
climate-related 
 financial statement metrics. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as 
part of its regular, 
risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation 
 arrangements of 
banking organizations, such 
as Popular, 
that are 
not large, 
complex banking 
organizations. Deficiencies will 
be 
 incorporated into 
the 
organization s supervisory 
ratings, which 
can 
affect 
the 
organization s ability 
to 
make 
acquisitions and 
take 
 other 
actions. Enforcement 
actions may 
be taken 
against 
a 
banking 
organization if 
its 
incentive compensation 
arrangements, or 
 related 
risk-management 
control 
or 
governance 
processes, 
pose 
a 
risk 
to 
the 
organization s 
safety 
and 
soundness 
and 
the 
 organization is not taking prompt and effective measures 
to correct the deficiencies. 
 The 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board, 
OCC 
and 
FDIC 
have 
issued 
comprehensive 
final 
guidance 
on 
incentive 
compensation 
 policies intended to discourage excessive risk-taking in 
the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations 
in order to not 

21 
 undermine 
the 
safety 
and 
soundness 
of 
such 
organizations. 
The 
guidance, 
which 
covers 
all 
employees 
that 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
 materially affect 
the risk 
profile of an 
organization, either individually 
or as 
part of 
a group, 
is based 
upon the key 
principles that a 
 banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond 
 the 
organization s 
ability 
to 
effectively 
identify 
and 
manage 
risks, 
(ii) 
be 
compatible 
with 
effective 
internal 
controls 
and 
risk 
 management, and (iii) 
be supported by 
strong corporate governance, 
including active and 
effective oversight 
by the 
organization s 
 board of directors. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking 
 agencies 
and 
the 
SEC, 
to 
adopt 
rules 
prohibiting 
incentive-based 
payment 
arrangements that 
encourage 
inappropriate 
risks 
by 
 providing excessive 
compensation or 
that could 
lead to 
a material 
financial loss 
at specified 
regulated entities 
having at 
least 1 
 billion in total 
assets (including Popular, 
PNA, BPPR and 
PB). The U.S. 
financial regulators proposed revised 
rules in 2016, 
which 
 have not been finalized. 
 In October 
2022, the SEC 
adopted a final 
rule requiring securities 
exchanges to adopt 
rules mandating, in 
the case of 
a 
 restatement, the 
recovery or 
 clawback of 
excess incentive-based 
compensation paid 
to current 
or former 
executive officers 
and 
 requiring listed 
issuers to 
disclose any 
recovery analysis where 
recovery is 
triggered by 
a restatement. 
The excess 
compensation 
 would be based 
on the amount 
the executive officer 
would have received 
had the incentive-based 
compensation been determined 
 using the 
restated financials. The 
final rule 
requires the securities 
exchanges to propose 
conforming listing standards 
by February 
 26, 
2023 
and 
requires 
the 
standards 
to 
become 
effective 
no 
later 
than 
November 
28, 
2023. 
Each 
listed 
issuer, 
which 
includes 
 Popular as a 
listed issuer on 
the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, would then 
be required to 
adopt a clawback 
policy within 60 
days after 
its 
 exchange s 
listing standard 
has 
become 
effective. 
Popular 
will 
work 
to 
implement these 
new 
requirements 
as 
the 
rule 
becomes 
 effective. 
 Regulation of Broker-Dealers
 Our subsidiary, 
PS, is a 
registered broker-dealer with the 
SEC and subject to 
regulation and examination by 
the SEC as 
 well 
as 
FINRA 
and 
other 
self-regulatory 
organizations. 
These 
regulations 
cover 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
issues, 
including 
capital 
 requirements; 
sales 
and 
trading 
practices; 
use 
of 
client 
funds 
and 
securities; 
the 
conduct 
of 
directors, 
officers 
and 
employees; 
 record-keeping and recording; 
supervisory procedures to 
prevent improper trading 
on material 
non-public information; qualification 
 and 
licensing 
of 
sales 
personnel; 
and 
limitations 
on 
the 
extension 
of 
credit 
in 
securities 
transactions. 
In 
addition 
to 
federal 
 registration, state securities 
commissions require the 
registration of certain 
broker-dealers. PS is 
registered with 35 
U.S. state and 
 territory securities commissions. 
 Regulation of Reinsurers, Insurance Producers and 
Agents
 Popular s subsidiaries that are engaged in 
insurance agency and producer activities are 
subject to regulatory supervision 
 by the Puerto 
Rico Office of 
the Commissioner of Insurance 
and to insurance laws 
and regulations requiring licensing 
of insurance 
 producers and 
agents. Popular s 
reinsurance subsidiaries 
are subject 
to 
licensure and 
regulatory supervision 
by the 
Puerto Rico 
 Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and 
to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among 
other things, minimum capital and 
 solvency standards, financial reporting, restrictions on 
the amount of dividends payable, record 
keeping and examinations. 
 Puerto Rico Regulation 
 As 
a 
commercial 
bank 
organized 
under 
the 
laws 
of 
Puerto 
Rico, 
BPPR 
is 
subject 
to 
supervision, 
examination 
and 
 regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended 
 (the Banking Law ). 
 Section 27 
of the 
Banking Law 
requires that 
at 
least ten 
percent (10 
of the 
yearly net 
income of 
BPPR be 
credited 
 annually to a reserve 
fund. The apportionment must be 
done every year until the 
reserve fund is equal to 
the total of paid-in 
capital 
 on common and preferred stock. During 2022, 76.9 
million was transferred to the statutory reserve 
account. 
 Section 
27 
of 
the 
Banking 
Law 
also 
provides that 
when 
the 
expenditures 
of 
a 
bank 
are 
greater 
than 
its 
receipts, the 
 excess of the 
former over the latter 
must be charged 
against the undistributed profits 
of the bank, and 
the balance, if 
any, must 
be 
 charged against 
the reserve 
fund. 
If the 
reserve fund 
is 
not sufficient 
to 
cover such 
balance in 
whole or 
in part, 
the outstanding 

22 
 amount must be charged against 
the capital account and no 
dividend may be declared until capital 
has been restored to its 
original 
 amount and the reserve fund to 20 of the original 
capital. 
 Section 16 of the 
Banking Law requires every 
bank to maintain a 
legal reserve that, except 
as otherwise provided by 
the 
 Office of 
the Commissioner, 
may not be 
less than 20 
of its 
demand liabilities, excluding 
government deposits (federal, 
state and 
 municipal) that 
are secured 
by collateral. 
If a 
bank is 
authorized to 
establish one 
or more 
bank branches 
in a 
state of 
the United 
 States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state 
or country, the Office of the 
 Commissioner 
may 
exempt 
said 
branch 
or 
branches 
from 
the 
reserve 
requirements 
of 
Section 
16. 
Pursuant 
to 
an 
order 
of 
the 
 Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
dated 
November 
24, 
1982, 
BPPR 
has 
been 
exempted 
from 
the 
reserve 
requirements 
of 
the 
Federal 
 Reserve 
System 
with 
respect 
to 
deposits 
payable 
in 
Puerto 
Rico. 
Accordingly, 
BPPR 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
reserve 
requirement 
 prescribed by the Banking Law. During 2022, BPPR was in compliance 
with the statutory reserve requirement. 
 Section 17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to 
any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an 
 aggregate amount of 
fifteen percent (15 
of the paid-in 
capital and reserve fund 
of the bank. 
As of December 
31, 2022, the 
legal 
 lending limit 
for BPPR 
under this 
provision was 
approximately 334 
million. In 
the case 
of loans 
which are 
secured by 
collateral 
 worth at 
least 25 more 
than the amount 
of the 
loan, the 
maximum aggregate amount 
of such secured 
loans is 
increased to 
one 
 third of 
the paid-in capital 
of the bank, 
plus its reserve 
fund. In no 
event may the 
total of unsecured 
and secured loans 
to any one 
 person, firm, partnership or corporation exceed an aggregate amount of 33 1/3 of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. 
 If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 
1 in the last examination performed by the Office 
of the Commissioner or any 
 regulatory agency, 
its legal 
lending limit 
shall also 
include 15 
of 50 
of its 
undivided profits 
and for 
loans secured 
by collateral 
 worth at 
least 25 
more than 
the amount 
of the 
loan, the 
capital of 
the bank 
shall also 
include 33 
1/3 of 
50 of 
its undivided 
 profits. Institutions rated 2 
in their last 
regulatory examination may include this 
additional component in their 
legal lending limit 
only 
 with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section 17 on the amount of loans 
 that are wholly secured 
by bonds, securities and 
other evidence of indebtedness 
of the Government of 
the United States or 
Puerto 
 Rico, 
or 
by 
current 
debt 
bonds, 
not 
in 
default, 
of 
municipalities 
or 
instrumentalities 
of 
Puerto 
Rico. 
During 
2022, 
BPPR 
was 
in 
 compliance with the lending limit requirements of Section 
17 of the Banking Law. 
 Section 
14 
of 
the 
Banking Law 
authorizes a 
bank to 
conduct certain 
financial 
and 
related 
activities directly 
or 
through 
 subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and originating and servicing 
mortgage loans. BPPR engages in finance 
 leasing through 
its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, 
Popular Auto, 
LLC, which 
is organized 
and operates 
in Puerto 
Rico. The 
origination 
 and servicing of mortgage loans is conducted by 
Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR. 
 With 
respect to 
information privacy, 
Puerto 
Rico 
law 
requires businesses 
to 
implement information 
security 
controls to 
 protect 
consumers 
personal 
information 
from 
breaches, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
notice 
of 
any 
breach 
to 
affected 
customers. 
In 
 addition, as 
noted above 
in Regulation 
of 
Reinsurers, Insurance 
Producers and 
Agents , Popular s 
reinsurance subsidiaries 
are 
 subject to 
licensure and regulatory 
supervision by the 
Puerto Rico Office 
of the 
Commissioner of Insurance 
and to insurance 
laws 
 and regulations.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 We, like 
other financial institutions, 
face risks 
inherent to 
our business, 
financial condition, liquidity, 
results of 
operations 
 and 
capital 
position. 
These 
risks 
could 
cause 
our 
actual 
results 
to 
differ 
materially 
from 
our 
historical 
results 
or 
the 
results 
 contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. 
 The risks described in 
this report are not the 
only risks we face. Additional 
risks and uncertainties not currently 
known by 
 us 
or 
that 
we 
currently 
deem 
to 
be 
immaterial, 
or 
that 
are 
generally 
applicable 
to 
all 
financial 
institutions, 
may 
also 
materially 
 adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position. 
 ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS 
 Weakness in 
the economy, 
particularly in 
Puerto Rico, 
where a 
significant portion 
of our 
business is 
concentrated, has 
 adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely 
impact us in the future. 
 We have been, and will continue to be, impacted by global and local 
economic and market conditions, including weakness 
 in 
the 
economy, 
disruptions 
and 
volatility 
in 
the 
financial 
markets, 
inflation, 
changing 
monetary 
and 
fiscal 
policies, 
geopolitical 
 conflicts, consumer and changes 
in business sentiment and 
unemployment. A significant portion of 
our business is concentrated in 
 Puerto Rico, which 
accounted for approximately 79 of 
our assets and 84 
of our deposits 
as of December 31, 
2022 and 82 
of 
 our 
revenues 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022. 
As 
a 
result, 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations 
are 
highly 
 dependent 
on 
the 
general 
trends 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
economy 
and 
other 
conditions 
affecting 
Puerto 
Rico 
consumers 
and 
 businesses. The 
concentration of 
our operations 
in Puerto 
Rico exposes 
us to 
greater risks 
than other 
banking companies 
with a 
 wider geographic base. 
 Puerto Rico 
has faced significant 
economic and fiscal 
challenges in the 
past, including a 
severe recession that 
began in 
 2007 and 
persisted for 
over a 
decade and 
an acute 
fiscal crisis 
that led 
the Puerto 
Rico government 
to file 
for a 
form 
of federal 
 bankruptcy protection 
in 2017. 
Puerto Rico s 
fiscal and 
economic challenges 
have in 
the past 
adversely affected 
our customers, 
 resulting 
in 
higher 
delinquencies, 
charge-offs 
and 
increased 
losses 
for 
us. 
While 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economy 
has 
been 
gradually 
 recovering 
and 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government 
has 
recently 
emerged from 
bankruptcy, 
Puerto 
Rico 
still 
faces 
economic 
and 
fiscal 
 challenges and could face additional economic or fiscal challenges in the 
future, including as a result of weakness or volatility in 
the 
 global economy 
and financial 
markets. A 
weakening of 
the Puerto 
Rico economy 
or other 
adverse economic 
conditions affecting 
 Puerto Rico 
consumers and 
businesses could 
result in 
decreased demand 
for our 
products or 
services, deterioration 
in the 
credit 
 quality 
of 
our 
customers, 
higher delinquencies, 
charge-offs 
or 
increased losses, 
all 
of 
which 
could adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 We are also exposed to risks related to the state of the local economies of the other markets in which we do business, such as New 
 York 
and Florida, 
and to 
the state 
of the 
global and 
U.S. economy 
and financial 
markets. Global 
financial markets 
have recently 
 experienced periods of 
extraordinary disruption and volatility, 
exacerbated by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the war 
in Ukraine, supply-
 chain disruptions, high levels of, and rapid increases in, inflation, 
and increasing and high interest rates. Inflationary pressures have 
 increased certain 
of our 
expenses (including 
our personnel 
expenses) and 
adversely affected 
consumer sentiment. 
Central bank 
 responses to inflationary pressures have led to 
higher market interest rates and, in turn, 
lower activity levels across U.S. and global 
 financial markets. These circumstances have resulted in, and could continue to 
result in, reductions in the value of 
our investments. 
 If 
these 
conditions 
persist 
or 
worsen, 
our 
results 
of 
operations, financial 
position 
and 
liquidity could 
be 
materially 
and 
adversely 
 affected. 
 Changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
and 
credit 
spreads 
can 
adversely 
impact 
our 
financial 
condition, 
including 
our 
investment 
 portfolio, 
since 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
our 
business involves 
borrowing 
and 
lending 
money, 
and 
investing in 
financial 
 instruments. 
 Our business 
and financial 
performance are 
impacted by 
market interest 
rates and 
movements in 
those rates. 
Since a 
 high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes 
 in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates, have had and could in the future have 

24 
 a material impact on our results 
of operations and the values of our 
assets and liabilities, including our investment portfolio. 
Interest 
 rates are 
highly sensitive 
to many 
factors over 
which we 
have no 
control and 
which we 
may not 
be able 
to anticipate 
adequately, 
 including general 
economic conditions 
and the 
monetary and 
tax policies 
of various 
governmental bodies, 
particularly the 
Federal 
 Reserve Board. 
 Increasing levels of inflation, driven 
by pent-up demand and supply-chain disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic 
 and the war in Ukraine, led the Federal Reserve Board to execute a series of sharp benchmark interest rate increases over the past 
 year. 
While the 
pace at 
which inflation 
is increasing 
has slowed 
down in 
recent months, 
following a 
mid-2022 peak, 
the Federal 
 Reserve Board has signaled 
that it may increase 
interest rates further to 
continue to control and 
bring down inflation. If 
the interest 
 rates we 
pay on 
our deposits and 
other borrowings increase 
at a 
faster rate than 
the interest rates 
we receive on 
loans and 
other 
 investments, our net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. Higher interest rates could also lead 
 to fewer originations of commercial and residential real 
estate loans, loss of deposits, a misalignment in the 
pricing of short-term and 
 long-term 
borrowings, 
less 
liquidity 
in 
the 
financial 
markets 
and 
higher 
funding 
costs. 
Furthermore, 
higher 
interest 
rates 
could 
 negatively affect 
the payment 
performance on 
loans linked 
to variable 
interest rates 
to the 
extent borrowers 
are unable 
to afford 
 higher 
interest 
payments, which 
could 
result 
in 
higher 
delinquencies. Additionally, 
inflationary 
pressure arising 
from 
increases in 
 interest rates may also affect borrowers financial condition and their ability to pay their debts when due. All of these outcomes could 
 adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and capital levels. 
 The 
rapid 
rise 
in 
interest 
rates 
in 
2022 
resulted 
in 
approximately 
 2.5 
billion 
in 
unrealized 
mark-to-market 
losses 
on 
 available-for-sale securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In October 2022, we transferred U.S. Treasury securities with 
 a fair value of approximately 6.5 billion (par value of 
 7.4 billion), and with accumulated unrealized losses of 873 million, from our 
 available-for-sale portfolio to our held-to-maturity portfolio to reduce the 
impact of further increases in interest rates on 
accumulated 
 other comprehensive 
income and 
tangible capital. 
However, 
if interest 
rates continue 
to rise 
rapidly or 
for a 
prolonged period, 
we 
 may accumulate significant additional mark-to-market losses 
on other investment securities in 
our available-for-sale portfolio, which 
 may adversely affect our tangible capital and impact our 
ability to return capital to our stockholders. 
 We are 
also subject 
to risks 
related to 
the transition 
away from 
the London 
Interbank Offered 
Rate LIBOR 
upon the 
 cessation in 
the publication 
of the 
remaining principal 
tenors of 
U.S. dollar 
LIBOR, which 
is scheduled 
for June 
30, 2023. These 
 risks were significantly reduced following the enactment by the U.S. 
Congress of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the first 
 quarter 
of 
2022, 
which 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
replacing 
LIBOR 
with 
new 
benchmark 
rates 
based 
on 
the 
Secured 
Overnight 
 Financing Rate SOFR 
in loans that 
do not have 
effective alternate interest 
rate provisions. However, 
there is no 
assurance that 
 the new SOFR-based benchmarks will be similar to, 
or produce the economic equivalent of, LIBOR, and the 
transition to these new 
 benchmark rates could result in operational, systems or 
other practical challenges, litigation or 
other adverse consequences. 
 For a discussion of the Corporation s 
interest rate sensitivity, please refer 
to the Risk Management section of the MD A 
 in this Form 10-K. 
 Fiscal challenges facing the U.S. government could negatively impact financial markets, which in turn could have 
 an adverse effect on our financial position or 
results of operations. 
 In 
January 
2023, 
the 
outstanding 
debt 
of 
the 
U.S. 
reached 
its 
statutory 
limit 
and 
the 
U.S. 
Treasury 
Department 
 commenced taking 
extraordinary measures 
to 
prevent the 
U.S. from 
defaulting on 
its obligations. 
If Congress 
does not 
raise the 
 debt 
ceiling, 
the 
U.S. 
could 
default 
on 
its 
obligations, 
including 
U.S. 
Treasury 
securities, 
which 
play 
an 
integral 
role 
in 
financial 
 markets. Many 
of the 
investment securities 
held in 
our portfolio 
are issued 
by the 
U.S. government 
and government 
agencies. A 
 U.S. 
government 
debt 
default, 
threatened 
debt 
default 
or 
downgrade 
of 
the 
sovereign 
credit 
ratings 
of 
the 
U.S. 
by 
credit 
rating 
 agencies 
could 
have 
a 
significant 
adverse 
impact 
on 
market 
volatility 
and 
illiquidity, 
lead 
to 
further 
increases 
in 
interest 
rates, 
 heighten 
operational 
risks 
relating 
to 
the 
clearance 
and 
settlement 
of 
transactions, 
and 
result 
in 
a 
significant 
deterioration 
in 
 economic conditions in 
the U.S. and 
worldwide. Even if 
the U.S. does 
not default, continued 
uncertainty relating to 
the debt ceiling 
 could 
result in 
downgrades of 
the U.S. 
credit 
rating, which 
could adversely 
affect 
market conditions, 
lead 
to 
further increases 
in 
 interest rates 
and borrowing 
costs or 
necessitate significant 
operational changes 
among market 
participants if 
the liquidity 
or fair 
 value of U.S. Treasury and/or agency securities decreases. Further, the fair value, liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by, 
 or other obligations of, agencies of the U.S. 
government as well as municipal bonds could be 
similarly adversely affected. 
 BUSINESS RISKS 
 Negative 
changes 
in 
the 
financial 
condition 
of 
our 
clients 
have 
adversely 
impacted 
us 
in 
the 
past 
and 
may 
adversely 
 impact us in the future. 

25 
 
A significant portion of 
our business involves lending money, 
which exposes us to 
credit risk and 
risk of loss if 
borrowers 
 do 
not 
repay 
their 
loans, 
leases, credit 
cards 
or 
other 
credit 
obligations. 
The 
performance of 
these 
credit 
portfolios 
significantly 
 affects our 
financial condition 
and results 
of operations. 
We have 
in the 
past been 
adversely affected 
by negative 
changes in 
the 
 financial condition of our clients due to weakness in 
the Puerto Rico and U.S. economy. If the current economic environment were to 
 deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which may result in higher levels 
of credit losses 
 and reserves for credit losses. 
 We are exposed to 
increased credit risks and credit losses 
to the extent our clients are 
concentrated by industry segment 
 or type of client.
 Our credit risk and credit 
losses can increase to the extent 
our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in 
the same 
 or similar 
activities or 
in borrowers 
who as 
a group 
may be 
uniquely or 
disproportionately affected 
by certain 
economic or 
market 
 conditions. We have significant 
exposure to borrowers in certain 
economic sectors, such as residential 
and commercial real estate, 
 hospitality and healthcare. Challenging economic or market conditions that affect 
the industries or types of clients to 
which we have 
 significant exposure could result in higher credit 
losses and adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 We also 
have direct 
lending and 
investment exposure 
to Puerto 
Rico government 
entities, which 
have faced 
significant 
 fiscal challenges. 
At December 
31, 2022, 
our exposure 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
government consisted 
of 374 
million in 
direct lending 
 exposure to Puerto 
Rico municipalities and 
 251 million in 
loans insured or 
securities issued by 
Puerto Rico governmental 
entities 
 but for 
which the 
principal source 
of repayment 
is non-governmental. 
We also 
have indirect 
lending exposure 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
 government in the 
form of loans 
to private borrowers 
who are service 
providers, lessors, suppliers 
or have other 
relationships with 
 the Puerto Rico government. While the overall fiscal situation 
of the Puerto Rico government has improved in recent years, 
including 
 as 
result 
of 
the 
government 
and 
certain 
of 
its 
instrumentalities 
having 
restructured 
their 
debt 
obligations, 
some 
Puerto 
Rico 
 government entities, including certain municipalities, still face significant 
fiscal challenges. A deterioration in the fiscal situation of 
the 
 Puerto Rico 
government and its 
instrumentalities, and in 
particular in the 
fiscal situation 
of the 
Puerto Rico 
municipalities to 
which 
 we have direct lending exposure, could result in 
higher credit losses and reserves for credit losses. For 
a discussion of risks related 
 to the Corporation s credit exposure to the Puerto Rico 
and USVI governments, see the Geographic and 
Government Risk section in 
 the MD A section of this Form 10-K. 
 Deterioration in the 
values of real 
properties securing our commercial, mortgage 
loan and construction portfolios 
have in 
 the past resulted, and may in the future result, 
in increased credit losses and harm our results 
of operations.
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, approximately 
56 of 
our loan 
portfolio consisted 
of loans 
secured by 
real estate 
collateral 
 (comprised of 29 in commercial loans, 25 in residential 
mortgage loans and 2 in construction loans). 
The value of the collateral 
 securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located. Weakness in the economy 
 of some of the 
markets we serve has in 
the past resulted in significant 
declines in the value of 
the real properties securing our loan 
 portfolio, leading to increased credit losses. If the value of 
the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in the 
 future, we may be 
required to increase our 
provisions for loan losses 
and allowance for loan 
losses. Any such increase could 
have 
 an adverse effect on 
our financial condition and results of 
operations. For more information on the credit 
quality of our construction, 
 commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk 
section of the MD A included in this Form 
10-K. 
 We 
are 
exposed 
to 
credit 
risk 
from 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
have 
been 
sold 
or 
are 
being 
serviced 
subject 
to 
recourse 
 arrangements. 
 Popular 
is 
generally 
at 
risk 
for 
mortgage 
loan 
defaults 
from 
the 
time 
it 
funds 
a 
loan 
until 
the 
time 
the 
loan 
is 
sold 
or 
 securitized into a 
mortgage
 -
 backed security. 
However, we 
have retained part 
of the credit 
risk on sales 
of mortgage loans 
through 
 recourse 
arrangements, 
and 
we 
also 
service 
certain 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolios 
with 
recourse. 
At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
were 
 exposed to credit risk with respect to 0.6 billion in residential mortgage loans sold 
or serviced subject to credit recourse provisions, 
 consisting principally of loans associated with the Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac programs. Pursuant to such recourse provisions, 
we 
 are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss in the event of a customer default. The 
 maximum potential amount of future payments that 
we would be required to make 
under the recourse arrangements in the 
event of 
 nonperformance 
by 
the 
borrowers 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
total 
outstanding balance 
of 
the 
residential mortgage 
loans 
serviced 
with 
 recourse 
and 
interest, 
if 
applicable. In 
the 
event of 
nonperformance by 
the 
borrower, 
we 
have rights 
to 
the underlying 
collateral 
 securing the 
mortgage loan. 
During 2022, 
we repurchased 
approximately 7 
million in 
mortgage loans 
subject to 
credit recourse 
 provisions. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
our liability 
established 
to cover 
the estimated 
credit loss 
exposure related 
to loans 
sold or 
 serviced with credit recourse amounted 
to 7 million. We may suffer losses on these loans if the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of 

26 
 the property underlying 
a defaulted mortgage 
loan are less 
than the outstanding 
principal balance of 
the loan plus 
any uncollected 
 interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of 
the related property. 
 Defective and repurchased
 loans may harm our business and financial 
condition.
 In 
connection 
with 
the 
sale 
and 
securitization 
of 
mortgage 
loans, 
we 
are 
required 
to 
make 
a 
variety 
of 
customary 
 representations 
and 
warranties regarding 
Popular 
and 
the 
loans being 
sold 
or securitized. 
Our 
obligations with 
respect to 
these 
 representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life 
of the loan, and they relate 
to, among other things, compliance 
 with 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
underwriting 
standards, 
the 
accuracy 
of 
information 
in 
the 
loan 
documents 
and 
loan 
file 
and 
the 
 characteristics 
and 
enforceability of 
the 
loan. 
A 
loan 
that 
does 
not 
comply 
with 
the 
secondary 
market s 
requirements 
may 
take 
 longer to 
sell, impact 
our ability 
to securitize 
the loans 
or pledge 
the loans 
as collateral 
for borrowings, 
or be 
unsalable or 
salable 
 only 
at 
a 
significant 
discount. 
Moreover, 
if 
any 
such 
loan 
is 
sold 
before 
we 
detect 
non-compliance, 
we 
may 
be 
obligated 
to 
 repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, 
or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss. 
We 
 seek to 
minimize repurchases and 
losses from defective 
loans by correcting 
flaws, if possible, 
and selling or 
re-selling such loans. 
 However, 
if 
we 
were 
to 
suffer 
significant 
losses 
from 
defective 
and 
repurchased 
loans, 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
 condition could be materially impacted. 
 If we are 
unable to maintain 
or grow our 
deposits, we may 
be subject to 
paying higher funding costs 
and our net 
interest 
 income may decrease. 
 
We must maintain adequate liquidity and funding sources 
to support our operations, comply with our financial 
obligations, 
 finance our transformation initiative, fund 
planned capital distributions and meet 
regulatory requirements. We rely 
primarily on bank 
 deposits 
as 
a 
low cost 
and stable 
source 
of 
funding 
for 
our 
lending activities 
and 
the 
operation of 
our 
business. 
Therefore, 
our 
 funding costs 
are largely 
dependent on 
our ability 
to maintain 
and grow 
our deposits. 
As our 
competitors have 
raised the 
interest 
 rates they pay on deposits, our 
funding costs have increased, as we have 
needed to increase the rates we pay 
to our depositors to 
 avoid losing 
deposits. We 
may also 
need to 
rely on 
more expensive 
sources of 
funding if 
deposits decrease. Rising 
interest rates 
 have 
also 
led 
customers 
to 
move 
their 
funds 
to 
alternative 
investments 
that 
pay 
higher 
interest 
rates. 
Furthermore, 
we 
have 
a 
 significant 
amount 
of 
deposits 
from 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government, 
its 
instrumentalities 
and 
municipalities 15.2 
billion, 
or 
 approximately 25 of our 
total deposits, as of 
December 31, 2022), and 
the amount of these 
deposits may fluctuate depending on 
 the financial 
condition and 
liquidity of 
these entities, 
as well 
as 
on our 
ability to 
maintain these 
customer relationships. 
If we 
are 
 unable to 
maintain or 
grow our 
deposits for 
any 
reason, we 
may be 
subject to 
paying higher 
funding costs 
and 
our 
net interest 
 income may decrease. 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 We 
and our 
third-party providers 
have been, 
and expect 
in the 
future to 
continue to 
be, subject 
to cyber 
attacks, which 
 could cause substantial harm and have an adverse 
effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part 
 because 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
new 
technologies, 
such 
as 
Internet 
and 
mobile 
banking 
to 
conduct 
instant 
financial 
transactions 
 anywhere globally, 
growing geo-political threats, 
such as the 
ongoing Russian conflict 
in Ukraine, and 
the increased sophistication 
 and activities of organized crime, hackers, 
terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In 
the ordinary course of business, 
 we rely on 
electronic communications and 
information systems to 
conduct our operations 
and to transmit 
and store sensitive 
data. 
 We employ 
a layered 
defensive approach 
that employs 
people, processes 
and technology 
to manage 
and maintain 
cybersecurity 
 controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity 
and 
 identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to 
 protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as 
 the threats from cyber-attacks 
are continuous and severe. The 
risk of a 
security breach due to 
a cyber attack could 
increase in the 
 future as 
we continue 
to expand 
our mobile 
banking and 
other internet 
based product 
offerings, the 
use 
of the 
cloud for 
system 
 development and hosting and internal use of 
internet-based products and applications. 
 We 
continue to 
detect and 
identify attacks 
that are 
becoming more 
sophisticated and 
increasing in 
volume, as 
well as 
 attackers that 
respond rapidly to 
changes in 
defensive countermeasures. The 
most significant cyber-attack 
risks that we 
may face 
 are e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, 
computer intrusion and the 
exploitation of software zero-day 
vulnerabilities that 
 might result 
in disruption 
of services 
and in 
the exposure 
or loss 
of customer 
or proprietary 
data. Loss 
from e-fraud 
occurs when 
 cybercriminals compromise 
our systems 
or the 
systems of 
our customers 
and extract 
funds from 
customer s credit 
cards or 
bank 
 accounts, including through 
brute force, password 
spraying and credential 
stuffing attacks directed 
at gaining unauthorized 
access 
 to 
individual 
accounts. 
Denial-of-service 
attacks 
intentionally 
disrupt 
the 
ability 
of 
legitimate 
users, 
including 
customers 
and 

27 
 employees, 
to 
access 
networks, 
websites 
and 
online 
resources. 
Computer 
intrusion 
attempts 
either 
direct 
or 
through 
social 
 engineering, supply chain compromise, email, text or voice messages, including 
using brand impersonation (regularly referred to as 
 phishing, vishing and smishing), might 
result in the compromise 
of sensitive customer data, 
such as account numbers, 
credit cards 
 and social security numbers, and could present 
significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs 
to Popular if successful. 
 We are 
the target of 
phishing, smishing and vishing 
attacks targeting both 
our customers and 
employees through brand, 
 email, text and 
voicemail impersonation, that 
have compromised the 
email accounts of 
certain of our 
customers and employees 
or 
 have 
resulted 
in 
our 
customers 
being 
deceived 
into 
revealing 
their 
sensitive 
information 
to 
threat 
actors. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
 assurances that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Our customer-facing platforms 
 are 
also 
routinely 
attacked 
by 
threat 
actors 
aiming 
to 
gain 
unauthorized 
access 
to 
our 
clients 
accounts. 
Popular 
has 
recently 
 implemented certain defensive measures in response to 
brute force attacks on one 
of our platforms which 
resulted in certain of our 
 customers 
log-in 
credentials 
and 
information 
being 
exposed. 
As 
a 
result, 
Popular 
notified, 
as 
required 
or 
otherwise 
deemed 
 appropriate, customers 
identified as 
affected by 
the incident. 
We have 
to date 
not experienced 
material losses 
in connection 
with 
 these 
attacks. 
Cyber-security 
risks 
have 
also 
been 
recently 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
discovery 
of 
zero-day 
vulnerabilities 
in 
widely 
 distributed 
third 
party 
software, 
such 
as 
the 
vulnerability 
identified 
in 
December 
2021 
in 
the 
Apache 
log4j, 
which 
could 
affect 
 Popular s or any of its service provider s 
systems. 
 The 
increased 
use 
of 
remote 
access 
and 
third-party 
video 
conferencing 
solutions 
to 
enable 
work-from-home 
 arrangements for 
employees 
and 
facilitating the 
use 
of 
digital channels 
by 
our 
customers, 
has 
increased 
our 
exposure to 
cyber 
 attacks. In 
addition, a 
third party 
could misappropriate 
confidential information 
obtained by 
intercepting signals 
or communications 
 from mobile devices used by Popular s customers or employees. Recent events, including the Russian conflict in Ukraine, have also 
 illustrated 
increased geo-political 
factors 
and the 
risks related 
to 
supply-chain compromises 
and 
de-stabilizing activities 
linked to 
 nation-state sponsored activity as an increasing trend 
to monitor actively. 
Risks and exposures related to cyber security 
attacks are 
 expected to 
remain high for 
the foreseeable future 
due to 
the rapidly evolving 
nature and sophistication 
of these 
threats, including 
 the rise in the use of cyber-attacks as geopolitical weapons. Although we are 
regularly targeted by unauthorized threat-actor activity, 
 we have not, to date, experienced any material 
losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. 

 A material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could 
have serious negative consequences for us, 
 including 
significant 
disruption 
of 
our 
operations 
and 
those 
of 
our 
clients, 
customers 
and 
counterparties, 
misappropriation 
of 
 confidential information 
of us 
or that 
of our 
clients, customers, 
counterparties or 
employees, or 
damage to 
computers or 
systems 
 used 
by 
us 
or 
by 
our 
clients, 
customers 
and 
counterparties, 
and 
could 
result 
in 
violations 
of 
applicable 
privacy 
and 
other 
laws, 
 financial loss 
to us 
or to 
our customers, 
loss of 
confidence in 
our security 
measures, customer 
dissatisfaction, significant litigation 
 exposure and harm to 
our reputation, all of 
which could have a 
material adverse effect 
on us. For example, 
if personal, non-public, 
 confidential 
or 
proprietary 
information 
in 
our 
possession 
were 
to 
be 
mishandled, 
misused 
or 
stolen, 
we 
could 
suffer 
significant 
 regulatory consequences, reputational damage 
and financial loss. 
Such mishandling, misuse 
or misappropriation could include, 
for 
 example, if such information 
were provided to parties 
who are not permitted 
to have the 
information, either by fault 
of our systems, 
 by our employees 
or counterparties, or 
where such information 
is intercepted or 
otherwise inappropriately taken by 
our employees 
 or third parties. 
 The 
extent 
of 
a 
particular 
cyber 
attack 
and 
the 
steps 
that 
we 
may 
need 
to 
take 
to 
investigate the 
attack 
may 
not 
be 
 immediately 
clear, 
and 
it 
may 
take 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
time 
before 
such 
an 
investigation 
can 
be 
completed. 
While 
such 
an 
 investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full 
extent of the harm caused by the cyber 
attack, and that damage 
 may continue to spread. 
These factors may inhibit 
our ability to provide 
rapid, full and reliable 
information about the cyber 
attack to 
 our clients, 
customers, counterparties and 
regulators, as well 
as the public. 
Moreover, potential 
new regulations may 
require us to 
 disclose information about 
a cybersecurity event before 
it has been 
resolved or fully 
investigated. Furthermore, it may 
not be clear 
 how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or 
 compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Cyber attacks could cause interruptions in our operations and result in the 
 incurrence 
of 
significant 
costs, 
including those 
related 
to 
forensic analysis 
and 
legal counsel, 
each of 
which may 
be 
required to 
 ascertain the extent 
of any potential 
harm to our 
customers, or employees, or 
damage to our information 
systems and any 
legal or 
 regulatory obligations that 
may result therefrom. 
Any cyber incidents 
could also result 
in, among other 
things, increased regulatory 
 scrutiny 
and adverse 
regulatory or 
civil 
litigation consequences. 
For a 
discussion of 
the guidance 
and rules 
that federal 
banking 
 regulators 
have 
released 
or 
proposed 
regarding 
cybersecurity 
and 
cyber 
risk 
management 
standards, 
see 
 Regulation 
and 
 Supervision in 
Part 
I, 
Item 
1 
Business, 
included in 
the 
Form 10-K 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 
2022. Any 
or 
all 
of 
the 
 foregoing factors could further increase the impact 
of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences 
of a cyber attack. 

 We also 
rely on 
third parties 
for the 
performance of 
a significant 
portion of 
our information 
technology functions and 
the 

28 
 provision of information security, 
technology and business process services. As a result, a 
successful compromise or circumvention 
 of 
the security 
of 
the systems 
of these 
third-party service 
providers could 
have serious 
negative consequences 
for us, 
including 
 misappropriation of 
confidential information 
of us 
or that 
of our 
clients, customers, 
counterparties or 
employees, or 
other negative 
 implications identified above with respect to a cyber-attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Cyber 
 attacks at third-party service 
providers are also becoming 
increasingly common, and, as 
a result, cybersecurity risks 
relating to our 
 vendors have 
increased. The most 
important of 
these third-party service 
providers for us 
is Evertec, and 
certain risks 
particular to 
 Evertec are 
discussed under 
 Operational Risks 
 We 
are subject 
to additional 
risks relating 
to the 
Evertec Business 
Acquisition 
 Transaction . During 2021, we 
determined that, as a result 
of the widely reported breach of 
Accellion, Inc. s File Transfer 
Appliance 
 tool, which 
was being 
used at 
the time 
of such 
breach by 
a U.S.-based 
third-party advisory 
services vendor 
of Popular, 
personal 
 information 
of 
certain 
Popular 
customers 
was 
compromised. 
As 
a 
result, 
Popular 
notified, 
as 
required 
or 
otherwise 
deemed 
 appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although we are not aware of fraudulent activity 
in connection with this 
 incident, 
Popular s 
networks 
and 
systems 
were 
not 
impacted, 
and 
our 
third-party 
service 
provider 
agreed 
to 
cover 
external 
 remediation costs associated with the incident. A compromise of the personal information of our 
customers maintained by third party 
 vendors 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
regulatory 
consequences, 
reputational 
damage 
and 
financial 
loss 
to 
us. 
The 
success 
of 
our 
 business depends 
in part 
on the 
continuing ability 
of these 
(and other) 
third parties 
to perform 
these functions 
and services 
in a 
 timely 
and 
satisfactory 
manner, 
which 
performance 
could 
be 
disrupted 
or 
otherwise 
adversely 
affected 
due 
to 
failures 
or 
other 
 information security 
events originating at 
the third 
parties or at 
the third parties 
suppliers or vendors 
(so-called fourth party 
risk ). 
 We 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
effectively 
directly 
monitor 
or 
mitigate 
fourth-party 
risk, 
in 
particular 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
the 
use 
of 
common 
 suppliers 
or 
vendors 
by 
the 
third 
parties that 
perform 
functions 
and 
services 
for 
us. 
For 
a 
discussion of 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
our 
 dependence 
on 
third 
parties, 
including 
Evertec, 
see 
 We 
rely 
on 
other 
companies 
to 
provide 
key 
components 
of 
our 
business 
 infrastructure, including certain of our core 
financial transaction processing and information technology and 
security services, which 
 exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material 
adverse effect on us in the Operational Risks section of Item 
 1A in this Form 10-K. 
 As 
cyber 
threats 
continue 
to 
evolve, 
we 
expect 
to 
expend 
significant 
additional 
resources 
to 
continue 
to 
modify 
or 
 enhance our 
layers of 
defense or 
to investigate 
and remediate 
additional information 
security vulnerabilities 
or incidents. 
System 
 enhancements and 
updates also 
create risks 
associated with 
implementing new 
systems and 
integrating them 
with existing 
ones, 
 including risks associated with supply chain compromises 
and the software development lifecycle of the 
systems used by us and our 
 service providers. Due 
to the complexity 
and interconnectedness of information 
technology systems, the 
process of enhancing 
our 
 layers 
of 
defense can 
itself 
create 
a 
risk 
of 
systems 
disruptions 
and 
security 
issues. 
In 
addition, 
addressing 
certain 
information 
 security vulnerabilities, such as 
hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect 
the performance of our 
information technology systems. 
 The ability of our 
hardware and software providers to deliver 
patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities 
in a timely manner 
can 
 introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability 
is being actively exploited by threat 
actors. Moreover, our ability 
to timely 
 mitigate 
vulnerabilities 
and 
manage 
such 
risks, 
given 
the 
rise 
in 
number 
of 
required 
patches 
and 
third-party 
software, 
including 
 zero-day 
vulnerabilities , 
as 
well 
as 
the 
obsolescence 
in 
some 
of 
our 
hardware 
and 
software, 
may 
impact 
our 
day-to-day 
 operations, the availability of our systems and 
delay the deployment of technology enhancements 
and innovation. 

 If Popular s operational systems, 
or those of 
external parties on which 
Popular s businesses depend, are 
unable to meet 
 the requirements of our 
businesses and operations or bank 
regulatory standards, or if they 
fail, have other significant 
shortcomings 
 or are impacted by cyber attacks, Popular could be 
materially and adversely affected. 
 Unforeseen or 
catastrophic events, 
including 
extreme weather 
events and 
other natural 
disasters, man-made 
disasters, 
 acts of violence or 
war, or the 
emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could 
cause a disruption in our 
operations or other 
 consequences that could have a material adverse 
effect on our financial condition and results 
of operations. 
 A 
significant 
portion 
of 
our 
operations 
are 
located 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
Florida, 
a 
region 
susceptible 
to 
hurricanes, 
 earthquakes and other 
similar events. In 
2017, Puerto Rico, 
USVI and BVI 
were severely impacted 
by Hurricanes Irma 
and Mar a, 
 which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected 
our clients in these markets, and in 2022, Hurricane 
 Fiona impacted the 
southwest area of 
Puerto Rico, 
adversely affecting our 
customers in 
that region. Other 
types of 
unforeseen or 
 catastrophic events, including 
pandemics, epidemics, man-made 
disasters, or acts 
of violence or 
war, or 
the fear that 
such events 
 could 
occur, 
could 
also 
adversely 
impact 
our 
operations 
and 
financial 
results. 
For 
example, 
in 
2020, 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
 severely 
impacted 
global 
health, 
financial 
markets, 
consumer 
spending 
and 
global 
economic 
conditions, 
and 
caused 
significant 
 disruption 
to 
businesses worldwide, 
including 
our 
business 
and 
those 
of 
our 
customers, service 
providers 
and 
suppliers. 
Future 
 unforeseen 
or 
catastrophic 
events, 
including 
the 
appearance 
of 
new 
strains 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
virus, 
and 
actions 
taken 
by 
 governmental 
authorities and 
other 
third 
parties in 
response to 
such 
events, 
could 
again 
adversely affect 
our 
operations, cause 
 economic 
and 
market disruption, 
adversely 
impact the 
ability 
of 
borrowers to 
timely 
repay their 
loans, 
or 
affect 
the value 
of 
any 

29 
 collateral held by us, any of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition or results 
of operations. 
 The frequency, 
severity and 
impact of 
future unforeseen 
or catastrophic 
events is 
difficult to 
predict. While 
we maintain 
insurance 
 against 
natural 
disasters 
and 
other 
unforeseen 
events, 
including 
coverage 
for 
business 
interruption, 
the 
insurance 
may 
not 
be 
 sufficient to cover all 
of the damage from any such 
event, and there is no insurance 
against the disruption that a catastrophic event 
 could produce to the markets that we serve and 
the potential negative impact to economic 
activity. 
 Climate change could have a material adverse 
impact on our business operations and that 
of our clients and customers.
 Our business and 
the activities and 
operations of our 
clients and customers 
may be disrupted 
by global climate 
change. 
 Potential physical risks 
from climate change 
include the increase 
in the 
frequency and severity 
of weather 
events, such as 
storms 
 and 
hurricanes, 
and 
long-term 
shifts 
in 
climate 
patterns, such 
as 
sustained 
higher 
and 
lower 
temperatures, 
sea 
level 
rise, 
heat 
 waves and 
droughts, among 
others. Additionally, 
the impact 
of climate 
change in 
the markets 
that we 
operate and 
in other 
global 
 markets may 
have the 
effect of 
increasing the 
costs or 
reducing the 
availability of 
insurance needed 
for our 
business operations. 
 Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. 
These transition risks may include 
 changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to 
 mitigate the 
effects 
of climate 
change. Changes 
in the 
legal 
and regulatory 
landscape may 
additionally increase 
our compliance 
 costs. 
These 
climate 
driven 
changes 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
impact 
on 
asset 
values 
and 
on 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
 performance and those of our clients and customers. 
 We 
rely 
on 
other 
companies 
to 
provide 
key 
components 
of 
our 
business 
infrastructure, 
including 
certain 
of 
our 
core 
 financial 
transaction 
processing 
and 
information 
technology 
and 
security 
services, 
which 
exposes 
us 
to 
a 
number 
of 
 operational risks that could have a material 
adverse effect on us. 
 Third parties provide key components of our business operations, such 
as data processing, information security, recording 
 and monitoring transactions, 
online banking interfaces and 
services, Internet connections and 
network access. The most 
important 
 of these third-party 
service providers for 
us is Evertec. 
Although the Evertec 
Business Acquisition Transaction 
narrowed the scope 
 of 
services 
which 
we 
are 
dependent 
on 
Evertec to 
obtain 
and 
released 
us 
from 
exclusivity 
restrictions 
that 
limited 
our 
ability 
to 
 engage other third-party 
providers of financial 
technology services, we 
are still dependent 
on Evertec for 
the provision of 
essential 
 services 
to 
our 
business, 
including 
certain 
of 
our 
core 
financial 
transaction 
processing 
and 
information 
technology 
and 
security 
 services. As 
a 
result, we 
are 
particularly exposed 
to 
the operational 
risks 
of Evertec, 
including those 
relating to 
a 
breakdown or 
 failure of Evertec s systems or internal controls environment. Over the course of 
our relationship with Evertec, we have experienced 
 interruptions 
and 
delays 
in 
key 
services 
provided 
by 
Evertec, 
as 
well 
as 
cyber 
breaches, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
system 
breakdowns, 
 misconfigurations 
and 
instances 
of 
application 
obsolescence, 
which 
have 
in 
certain 
cases 
led 
to 
exposure 
of 
BPPR 
customer 
 information. 
For 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
Evertec 
Business 
Acquisition 
Transaction, 
please 
refer 
to 
the 
Year 
2022 
Significant Events 
 section of the MD A. 

While we 
select third-party vendors 
carefully and 
have increased our 
oversight of these 
relationships, we do 
not control 
 the 
actions 
of 
our 
vendors. 
Any 
problems 
caused 
by 
these 
vendors, 
including 
those 
resulting 
from 
disruptions 
in 
the 
services 
 provided, vulnerabilities in or breaches 
of the vendor s systems, failure of 
the vendor to handle 
current or higher volumes, 
failure of 
 the vendor 
to provide services 
for any 
reason or 
poor performance of 
services, or 
failure of 
the vendor to 
notify us of 
a reportable 
 event in a timely manner, 
could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to 
our customers and otherwise conduct 
 our 
business, 
result in 
potential liability 
to 
clients 
and customers, 
result in 
the 
imposition of 
fines, 
penalties or 
judgments by 
our 
 regulators or 
harm to 
our reputation, 
any of 
which could 
materially and 
adversely affect 
us. The 
inability of 
our third-party 
service 
 providers to timely address 
evolving cybersecurity threats may further 
exacerbate these risks. Financial or 
operational difficulties of 
 a third-party vendor could also 
hurt our operations if those 
difficulties interfere with the vendor s ability to 
serve us. Replacing these 
 third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant 
delay and expense. Accordingly, 
the use of third parties 
creates an 
 unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. 

30 
 The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided 
to us by 
 Evertec, will be lengthy and complex. 
 Switching from 
one vendor 
of core 
bank processing 
and related 
technology and 
security services 
to 
one 
or more 
new 
 vendors 
is 
a 
complex 
process 
that 
carries 
business 
and 
financial 
risks. 
The 
implementation 
cycle 
for 
such 
a 
transition 
can 
be 
 lengthy and require significant financial and 
management resources from us. Such 
a transition can also expose us, 
and our clients, 
 to 
increased 
costs 
(including 
conversion 
costs), 
business 
disruption, 
as 
well 
as 
operational 
and 
cybersecurity 
risks. 
Upon 
the 
 transition of all or 
a portion of existing services 
provided by Evertec to a 
new financial services technology provider, 
either (i) at the 
 end of the term of the Second Amended and Restated 
Master Services Agreement (the MSA and related 
agreements or (ii) earlier 
 upon the 
termination of any 
service for 
convenience under the 
MSA, these transition 
risks could result 
in an 
adverse effect 
on our 
 business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec 
has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to 
us in 
 connection with 
the termination of 
the MSA, 
we are 
ultimately dependent on 
their ability 
to provide 
those services 
in a 
responsive 
 and competent manner. Furthermore, we 
may require transition assistance from Evertec beyond the term of 
the MSA, delaying and 
 lengthening any transition process away from Evertec 
while increasing related costs. 
 
Under the 
MSA, we 
are able 
to terminate 
services for 
convenience with 
180 days 
prior notice. 
We expect 
to exercise 
 during the 
term of 
the MSA 
the right 
to terminate 
certain services 
for convenience 
and to 
transition such 
services to 
other service 
 providers prior to the expiration 
of the MSA, subject to 
complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in 
the MSA and certain 
 other conditions. In 
practice, in order 
to switch 
to a 
new provider for 
a particular 
service, we will 
have to commence 
procuring and 
 working on 
a transition 
process for 
such service 
significantly in 
advance of 
its termination 
and, in 
any case, 
much earlier 
than the 
 automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of 
the MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current 
term of the MSA. 
 Furthermore, if 
we 
are 
unsuccessful or 
decide not 
to 
complete 
the transition 
after 
expending significant 
funds 
and 
management 
 resources, it could also result in an adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. 
 We are subject to additional risks relating to the 
Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction. 
 There are numerous additional risks and uncertainties 
associated with the Evertec Business Acquisition 
Transaction, including: 

unforeseen events may materially diminish the expected 
benefits of the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction; 

we have devoted, and will continue to, devote significant attention and resources to post closing implementation efforts, which 
 will involve a significant degree of technological complexity 
and reliance on Evertec and other third parties; 

we may be 
unable to retain the 
employees and third-party contractors hired or 
engaged by us in connection 
with the Evertec 
 Business Acquisition
 Transaction and who are 
necessary to operate and integrate the 
assets acquired as part of 
the Evertec 
 Business Acquisition
 Transaction (the Acquired Assets 

we may 
be subject 
to incremental 
operational and 
security risks 
arising from 
the transfer 
of the 
Acquired Assets 
to BPPR, 
 including those risks arising from, among 
other things, the activities required to 
execute network segmentation, the possibility 
 of misconfiguration of access or security services during 
the transition period and during the implementation 
of new processes 
 or 
security 
controls, 
the 
possibility 
of 
mismanagement 
of 
security 
services 
during 
the 
transition 
phase, 
and 
the 
need 
to 
 develop a robust internal control framework; 

the anticipated benefits of the Evertec Business Acquisition
 Transaction could be limited if Evertec fails to 
deliver to BPPR, in 
 a timely manner and in a manner that meets BPPR s requirements, the core 
application programming interfaces Core APIs 
 that Evertec has committed 
to develop in 
order for BPPR to 
connect future enhancements to the 
Acquired Assets to existing 
 Evertec core applications; 

we may be exposed to heightened business risks 
as a result of the extension until 
2035 of BPPR s exclusivity with Evertec in 
 connection with 
its merchant 
acquiring business, as 
well as 
the extension 
until 2030 
of BPPR s 
commitment with respect 
to 
 the ATH Network, in light of the pace of technology changes and competition 
in the payments industry; and 

Evertec s strategy and investments after the 
closing of the Evertec Business 
Acquisition
 Transaction may be refocused away 
 from Popular towards other strategic initiatives. 
 Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a 
material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial 
condition, 
 and/or stock price. 

31 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
 Our 
businesses 
are 
highly 
regulated, 
and 
the 
laws 
and 
regulations 
that 
apply 
to 
us 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
our 
 business and operations. 
 We are 
subject to 
extensive regulation 
under U.S. 
federal, state 
and Puerto 
Rico laws 
that govern 
almost all 
aspects of 
 our operations and limit the businesses 
in which we may be 
engaged, including regulation, supervision and examination by federal, 
 state and foreign banking 
authorities. These laws and regulations 
have expanded significantly over an 
extended period of time 
and 
 are primarily intended 
for the protection 
of consumers, borrowers and 
depositors. Compliance with 
these laws and 
regulations has 
 resulted, and will continue to result, in significant 
costs. 
 Additional 
laws 
and 
regulations 
may 
be 
enacted 
or 
adopted 
in 
the 
future 
that 
could 
significantly 
affect 
our 
powers, 
 authority 
and 
operations and 
which could 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
financial condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. In 
 particular, 
we 
could 
be 
adversely 
impacted 
by 
changes 
in 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
or 
changes 
in 
the 
application, 
interpretation 
or 
 enforcement of 
laws and 
regulations, that proscribe 
or institute more 
stringent restrictions on 
certain financial 
services activities or 
 impose new 
requirements relating to 
the impact of 
business activities on 
ESG concerns, the 
management of 
risks associated with 
 those 
concerns 
and 
the 
offering of 
products 
intended to 
achieve ESG-related 
objectives. If 
we 
do not 
appropriately comply 
with 
 current or 
future laws 
or regulations, 
we may 
be subject 
to fines, 
penalties or 
judgements, or to 
material regulatory restrictions 
on 
 our business, which could also materially and adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our participation 
(or lack 
of participation) 
in certain 
governmental programs, 
such as 
the Paycheck 
Protection Program 
 PPP enacted 
in response 
to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, 
also exposes 
us to 
increased legal 
and regulatory 
risks. We 
have also 
 been and could continue to 
be exposed to adverse 
action for the violation of 
applicable legal requirements or the improper 
conduct 
 of our employees in connection with such loans. For example, on January 24, 2023, Popular Bank consented to the imposition of an 
 order from 
the Federal 
Reserve Board 
requiring it 
to 
pay a 
 2.3 million 
civil money 
penalty to 
settle certain 
findings arising 
from 
 Popular Bank s approval of six (6) Payment Protection Program loans. We may also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if the 
 SBA determines that 
there have been 
deficiencies in the 
way a PPP 
loan was originated, 
funded, or serviced 
by us and 
denies its 
 liability under the guaranty, 
reduces the amount of the 
guaranty or, if 
it has already paid 
under the guaranty, 
seeks recovery of any 
 loss related to the deficiency. 
 We 
are from 
time to 
time subject 
to information 
requests, investigations 
and other 
regulatory enforcement 
proceedings 
 from departments 
of the 
U.S. and 
Puerto Rico 
governments, including 
those that 
investigate compliance 
with consumer 
 protection 
laws 
and 
regulations, which 
may 
expose 
us 
to 
significant penalties 
and 
collateral consequences, 
and 
could 
 result in higher compliance costs or restrictions 
on our operations. 
 We from time-to-time self-report 
compliance matters to, or receive 
requests for information from, departments of 
the U.S. 
 and Puerto 
Rico governments, 
including with 
respect to 
compliance with 
consumer protection 
laws and 
regulations. For 
example, 
 BPPR has 
in the 
past received 
subpoenas and 
other requests 
for information 
from the 
departments of 
the U.S. 
government that 
 investigate 
mortgage-related conduct, 
mainly 
concerning 
real 
estate 
appraisals 
and 
residential 
and 
construction 
loans 
in 
Puerto 
 Rico. BPPR 
has also 
self-identified and 
reported to 
applicable regulators compliance 
matters related 
to mortgage, 
credit reporting 
 and other consumer lending practices. 

 Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past, and may 
 in the 
future result, in 
judgments, settlements, fines, 
enforcement actions, penalties 
or other sanctions 
adverse to the 
Corporation, 
 which could materially and adversely affect the 
Corporation s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause 
serious 
 reputational 
harm. 
In 
connection with 
the 
resolution 
of 
regulatory proceedings, 
enforcement authorities 
may 
seek 
admissions of 
 wrongdoing 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
criminal 
pleas, 
which 
could 
lead 
to 
increased 
exposure 
to 
private 
litigation, 
loss 
of 
clients 
or 
 customers, 
and 
restrictions 
on 
offering 
certain 
products 
or 
services. 
In 
addition, 
responding 
to 
information-gathering 
requests, 
 investigations and 
other regulatory 
proceedings, regardless 
of the 
ultimate 
outcome of 
the matter, 
could be 
time-consuming and 
 expensive. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power 
 to 
prevent 
or 
remedy 
what 
they 
deem 
to 
be 
unsafe 
and 
unsound 
practices 
or 
violations 
of 
laws 
by 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
 companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion 
and power could have a negative impact 
on Popular. 
 Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs 
and anti-money laundering laws and regulations 
can increase our 
 operational 
and 
compliance 
costs 
and 
risks. 
If 
we, 
and 
our 
subsidiaries, 
affiliates 
or 
third-party 
service 
providers, 
are 
 found to 
have failed 
to comply 
with applicable 
economic and 
trade sanctions 
programs and 
anti-money laundering 
laws 
 and 
regulations, 
we 
could 
be 
exposed 
to 
fines, 
sanctions 
and 
penalties, 
and 
other 
regulatory 
actions, 
as 
well 
as 
 governmental investigations. 

32 
 As 
a 
federally 
regulated 
financial 
institution, 
we 
must 
comply 
with 
regulations 
and 
economic 
and 
trade 
sanctions 
and 
 embargo 
programs 
administered by 
the 
Office 
of 
Foreign 
Assets 
Control OFAC 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Treasury, 
as 
well 
as 
anti-money 
 laundering laws and regulations, including those under 
the Bank Secrecy Act. 
 Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering 
 into or facilitating 
unlicensed transactions with, for 
the benefit of, 
or in some 
cases involving the 
property and property interests 
of, 
 persons, 
governments or 
countries 
designated by 
the 
U.S. 
government under 
one 
or 
more 
sanctions 
regimes, 
and 
also 
prohibit 
 transactions 
that 
provide 
a 
benefit 
that 
is 
received in 
a 
country 
designated 
under 
one 
or 
more 
sanctions 
regimes. 
We 
are 
also 
 subject to 
a variety 
of reporting 
and other 
requirements under 
the Bank 
Secrecy Act, 
including the 
requirement to 
file suspicious 
 activity and currency 
transaction reports, that 
are designed to 
assist in 
the detection 
and prevention of 
money laundering, terrorist 
 financing 
and 
other 
criminal 
activities. 
In 
addition, 
as 
a 
financial 
institution 
we 
are 
required 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
identify 
our 
 customers, adopt formal 
and comprehensive anti-money 
laundering programs, scrutinize 
or altogether prohibit 
certain transactions 
 of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. 
law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and 
their 
 transactions. Failure 
by the 
Corporation, its 
subsidiaries, affiliates 
or 
third-party service 
providers to 
comply with 
these 
laws 
and 
 regulations 
could 
have 
serious 
legal 
and 
reputational 
consequences 
for 
the 
Corporation, 
including 
the 
possibility 
of 
regulatory 
 enforcement 
or 
other 
legal 
action, 
including 
significant 
civil 
and 
criminal 
penalties. 
We 
also 
incur 
higher 
costs 
and 
face 
greater 
 compliance risks in 
structuring and operating 
our businesses to comply 
with these requirements. The 
markets in which 
we operate 
 heighten these costs and risks. 
 We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us 
and our personnel in complying with these 
 applicable laws and 
regulations. With respect 
to OFAC 
regulations and economic 
and trade sanction 
programs, these policies 
and 
 procedures employ software to screen transactions for 
evidence of sanctioned-country and person s involvement. Consistent with 
a 
 risk-based approach and the 
difficulties in identifying and 
where applicable, blocking and rejecting 
transactions of our customers 
or 
 our customers customers that may involve a sanctioned 
person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies 
 and 
procedures 
will 
prevent 
us 
from 
violating 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations 
in 
transactions 
in 
which 
we 
engage, 
and 
such 
 violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 From time 
to time 
we have 
identified and 
voluntarily self-disclosed 
to OFAC 
transactions that 
were not 
timely identified, 
 blocked 
or 
rejected 
by 
our 
policies, 
controls 
and 
procedures 
for 
screening 
transactions 
that 
might 
violate 
the 
regulations 
and 
 economic and 
trade sanctions 
programs administered 
by OFAC. 
For example, 
during the 
second quarter 
of 2022, 
BPPR entered 
 into 
a 
settlement 
agreement 
with 
OFAC 
with 
respect 
to 
certain 
transactions 
processed 
on 
behalf 
of 
two 
employees 
of 
the 
 Government 
of 
Venezuela, 
in 
apparent 
violation 
of 
U.S. 
sanctions 
against 
Venezuela. 
Popular 
agreed 
to 
pay 
approximately 
 256,000 to settle the 
apparent violations, which had been 
self disclosed to OFAC. 
There can be no 
assurances that any failure 
to 
 comply with 
U.S. sanctions 
and embargoes, 
or 
with anti-money 
laundering laws 
and 
regulations, will 
not result 
in material 
fines, 
 sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 
 Furthermore, if 
the policies, 
controls, and 
procedures of 
one of 
the Corporation s 
third-party service 
providers, together 
 with our 
third-party oversight 
of such 
providers, do 
not prevent 
it from 
violating applicable 
laws and 
regulations in 
transactions in 
 which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its 
ability to provide services to us. 

 We 
are 
subject 
to 
regulatory 
capital 
adequacy 
requirements, 
and 
if 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
requirements 
our 
 business and financial condition will be adversely 
affected. 
 Under regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and other 
regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries 
 must 
meet 
requirements 
that 
include 
quantitative 
measures 
of 
assets, 
liabilities 
and 
certain 
off-balance 
sheet 
items, 
subject 
to 
 qualitative 
judgments 
by 
regulators 
regarding 
components, 
risk 
weightings 
and 
other 
factors. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
minimum 
 capital 
requirements 
and 
other 
regulatory 
requirements, 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
condition 
will 
be 
materially 
and 
adversely 
 affected. If 
a financial 
holding company 
fails to 
maintain well-capitalized 
status under 
the regulatory 
framework, or 
is deemed 
not 
 well managed 
under regulatory 
exam procedures, or 
if it 
experiences certain 
regulatory violations, its 
status as 
a financial 
holding 
 company and its 
related eligibility for 
a streamlined review 
process for acquisition 
proposals, and its 
ability to offer 
certain financial 
 products, may be 
compromised and its 
financial condition and 
results of operations 
could be adversely 
affected. The failure 
of any 
 depository 
institution 
subsidiary 
of 
a 
financial 
holding 
company 
to 
maintain 
well-capitalized 
or 
well-managed 
status 
could 
have 
 similar consequences. 
 
In addition, 
the Basel 
Committee on 
Banking Supervision 
published a 
set of 
standards to 
finalize Basel 
III in 
December 
 2017. These standards significantly revise the Basel capital framework, which could heighten regulatory capital standards if adopted 
 in the U.S. The federal bank regulators 
have not yet proposed rules to implement these 
revisions,
 and the impact on us will depend 

33 
 on the way 
the revisions are implemented 
in the U.S. 
See the Supervision and 
Regulation Capital Adequacy 
discussion in Item 
 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information 
related to the Basel III Capital Rules and 
Basel III finalization. 
 Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may 
have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 
 Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are subject to insurance up to applicable limits by the FDIC s DIF and, as a 
 result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. 
On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would 
 increase initial 
base deposit insurance 
assessment rates by 
2 basis 
points, beginning with 
the first 
quarterly assessment period 
of 
 2023. 
We 
are 
generally 
unable to 
control the 
amount 
of 
premiums that 
we 
are 
required to 
pay 
for 
FDIC 
insurance. If 
there 
are 
 additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital 
 position is 
impaired, we 
may be 
required to 
pay even 
higher FDIC 
premiums. Any 
future increases 
or special 
assessments may 
 materially adversely 
affect our 
results of 
operations. See 
the Supervision 
and Regulation FDIC Insurance 
discussion in 
Item 1. 
 Business of this Form 
10-K for additional information related to 
the FDIC s deposit insurance 
assessments applicable to BPPR and 
 PB. 

 The 
resolution 
of 
pending 
litigation 
and 
regulatory 
proceedings, 
if 
unfavorable, 
could 
have 
material 
adverse 
financial 
 effects or cause significant reputational harm to 
us, which, in turn, could seriously harm 
our business prospects. 
 We 
face 
legal 
risks 
in 
our 
businesses, 
and 
the 
volume 
of 
claims 
and 
amount 
of 
damages 
and 
penalties 
claimed 
in 
 litigation 
and 
regulatory 
proceedings against 
financial 
institutions 
remains 
high. 
Substantial 
legal 
liability 
or 
significant 
regulatory 
 action 
against 
us 
could 
have 
material adverse 
financial 
effects 
or cause 
significant 
reputational harm 
to 
us, 
which 
in 
turn 
could 
 seriously 
harm 
our 
business 
prospects.

our 
legal 
risk,

 LIQUIDITY RISKS 
 We are 
subject to risks 
related to our 
own credit rating 
and capital levels. 
Actions by the 
rating agencies or 
decreases in 
 our capital 
levels may 
have adverse effects 
on our 
business, including by 
raising the cost 
of our 
obligations or affecting 
 our ability to borrow. 
 Actions by the rating agencies 
could raise the cost of 
our borrowings, since lower rated securities 
are usually required by 
 the market 
to pay 
higher rates 
than obligations 
of higher 
credit quality. 
Our credit 
ratings were 
reduced substantially in 
2009 and, 
 although one of 
the three major rating 
agencies upgraded our senior 
unsecured rating back to 
 investment grade during 2021, 
the 
 remaining two rating agencies have not 
upgraded their current non-investment grade rating. The 
market for non-investment grade 
 securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. If we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or 
debt 
 securities into the capital markets, it 
is possible that there would not 
be sufficient demand to complete 
a transaction or that the 
cost 
 could be substantially higher than for more highly 
rated securities. 
 In 
addition, 
changes 
in 
our 
ratings 
and 
capital 
levels 
could 
affect 
our 
relationships 
with 
some 
creditors 
and 
business 
 counterparties. For example, having 
negative tangible capital may 
impact our ability to 
access some sources of 
wholesale funding. 
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency 
restricts the Federal Home 
Loan Bank of New 
York FHLBNY from lending to members 
of 
 the FHLBNY with negative 
tangible capital unless the 
member s primary banking regulator makes a 
written request to the 
FHLBNY 
 to 
maintain access 
to 
borrowings. Both 
BPPR 
and PB 
have secured 
borrowing facilities 
with the 
FHLBNY, 
and 
had 
outstanding 
 exposures of 1.9 
billion and 1.4 million 
respectively as of December 31, 
2022. Losing access to 
the FHLBNY borrowing facilities 
 could adversely impact 
liquidity at the 
banking subsidiaries. Additionally, 
if BPPR or 
PB cease to 
be well-capitalized, the 
FDIA and 
 regulations 
adopted thereunder 
would 
restrict 
their 
ability to 
accept 
brokered 
deposits 
and 
limits 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
payable 
on 
 deposits. 

Our banking 
subsidiaries also have 
recourse obligations under 
certain agreements with 
third parties, including 
 servicing and 
custodial agreements, 
that include 
ratings covenants. 
Upon failure 
to 
maintain the 
required credit 
ratings, the 
third 
 parties could 
have the 
right to 
require us 
to 
engage a 
substitute fund 
custodian and 
increase collateral 
levels securing 
recourse 
 obligations. Collateral pledged by 
us to secure 
recourse obligations approximated 29 
million at December 
31, 2022. Management 
 expects 
that 
we 
would 
be 
able 
to 
meet 
any 
additional 
collateral 
requirements 
if 
and 
when 
needed. 
The 
requirements 
to 
post 
 collateral under 
certain agreements 
or the 
loss of 
custodian funds, 
however, 
could reduce 
our liquidity 
resources and 
impact our 
 results of operations. The termination of those agreements or the 
inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have 
 an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
those 
businesses. 
Other 
counterparties 
are 
also 
sensitive 
to 
the 
risk 
of 
a 
ratings 
downgrade 
and 
the 
 implications 
for 
our 
businesses, 
and 
may 
be 
less 
likely 
to 
engage 
in 
transactions 
with 
us, 
or 
may 
only 
engage 
in 
them 
at 
a 
 substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below 
investment grade. 

34 
 As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from 
our subsidiaries for liquidity. 
 As a bank holding company, 
we depend primarily on dividends from 
our banking and other operating subsidiaries 
to fund 
 our cash needs, including to capitalize our subsidiaries. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to 
 make dividend 
payments and other 
distributions to 
us based 
on their earnings, 
dividend history, 
and capital 
position. Based 
on its 
 current financial condition, 
PB may 
not declare or 
pay a 
dividend without the 
prior approval of 
the Federal Reserve 
Board and 
the 
 NYSDFS. A 
failure by 
our banking subsidiaries 
to generate 
sufficient income 
and free 
cash flow to 
make dividend 
payments to 
us 
 may 
affect 
our 
ability to 
fund 
our cash 
needs, which 
could have 
a negative 
impact on 
our financial 
condition, liquidity, 
results 
of 
 operation or capital position. Such failure could also affect 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to 
repurchase shares 
 of our common stock. We have in the past suspended dividend payments 
on our common stock and preferred stock during times of 
 economic uncertainty, 
and there 
can be 
no assurance 
that we 
will be 
able to 
continue to 
declare dividends to 
our stockholders 
in 
 any future periods. 

 An 
impact 
on 
the 
tangible 
capital 
levels 
of 
our 
operating 
subsidiaries, 
could 
also 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
we 
may 
 upstream to the holding company. 
Tangible 
capital levels have, and may continue to 
be, adversely affected by the impact 
of rapidly 
 rising interest rates on investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. For a discussion 
of risks related to changes in interest 
 rates, 
see 
 Changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
and 
credit 
spreads 
can 
adversely 
impact 
our 
financial 
condition, 
including 
our 
investment 
 portfolio, since a significant portion of our 
business involves borrowing and lending money, 
and investing in financial instruments 
in 
 Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 We also depend 
on dividends from our 
banking and other operating subsidiaries 
to pay debt service 
on outstanding debt 
 and to 
repay maturing 
debt. We 
have 300 
million of 
notes that 
mature on 
September 14, 
2023. If 
we were 
unable to 
refinance 
 these 
notes, we 
could 
have to 
declare extraordinary 
dividends from 
our 
banking 
and 
other 
operating subsidiaries 
to 
repay such 
 notes. Our ability to 
declare such dividends would be 
subject to regulatory requirements and 
could require the prior 
approval of the 
 Federal Reserve Board. 
 STRATEGIC RISKS 
 Potential acquisitions of businesses or 
loan portfolios could increase some 
of the risks that 
we face, and may 
be delayed 
 or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. 
 To 
the extent 
permitted by 
our applicable 
regulators, we 
may pursue 
strategic acquisition 
opportunities. Acquiring 
other 
 businesses, however, involves various risks, 
including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the 
target company, 
 exposure 
to 
potential 
asset 
quality 
issues 
of 
the 
target 
company, 
potential 
disruption 
to 
our 
business, 
the 
possible 
loss 
of 
key 
 employees and customers of 
the target company, 
and difficulty in 
estimating the value of 
the target company. 
If we pay 
a premium 
 over book or 
market value in 
connection with an 
acquisition, some dilution of 
our tangible book 
value and net 
income per common 
 share 
may 
occur 
in 
connection with 
any 
future 
transaction. Furthermore, 
failure 
to 
realize the 
expected 
revenue increases, 
cost 
 savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse 
 effect on our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. 
 Similarly, 
acquiring 
loan 
portfolios 
involves 
various 
risks. 
When 
acquiring 
loan 
portfolios, 
management 
makes 
 assumptions and 
judgments about 
the collectability 
of the 
loans, including 
the creditworthiness 
of borrowers 
and the 
value of 
the 
 real 
estate and 
other assets 
serving 
as collateral 
for the 
repayment of 
secured loans. 
In 
estimating the 
extent of 
the losses, 
we 
 analyze 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
based 
on 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
volume 
and 
classification 
of 
loans, 
volume 
and 
trends 
in 
 delinquencies 
and 
nonaccruals, 
local 
economic 
conditions, 
and 
other 
pertinent 
information. 
If 
our 
assumptions 
are 
incorrect, 
 however, 
our actual 
losses could 
be higher 
than estimated 
and increased 
loss reserves 
may be 
required, which 
would negatively 
 affect our results of operations. 
 Finally, certain 
acquisitions by financial institutions, 
including us, are 
subject to approval 
by a variety 
of federal and 
state 
 regulatory agencies. 
Regulatory approvals 
could be 
delayed, impeded, 
restrictively conditioned 
or denied. 
We may 
fail to 
pursue, 
 evaluate 
or 
complete 
strategic 
and 
competitively 
significant 
acquisition 
opportunities 
as 
a 
result 
of 
our 
inability, 
or 
perceived 
or 
 anticipated inability, 
to obtain regulatory 
approvals in a 
timely manner, 
under reasonable conditions or 
at all. Difficulties 
associated 
 with 
potential 
acquisitions 
that 
may 
result 
from 
these 
factors 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 We 
have 
embarked 
on 
a 
broad-based 
multi-year, 
technological 
and 
business 
process 
transformation. 
The 
failure 
to 
 achieve 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
transformation 
project, 
the 
inability 
to 
maintain 
project 
expenses 
within 
current 
estimates 
or 
 delays in 
executing our plans 
to implement the 
transformation project, may 
materially and adversely 
affect our business, 

35 
 financial condition, results of operations, or 
cause reputational harm.
 The 
Corporation 
has 
embarked 
on 
a 
broad-based 
multi-year, 
technological 
and 
business 
process 
transformation. Our 
 technology and 
business transformation will 
be a significant 
priority for the 
Corporation over the 
next three years 
and beyond. 
We 
 expect the 
expenses tied 
to this 
transformation project, 
which will 
continue through 
at least 
2025, to 
result in 
an enhanced 
digital 
 experience for our clients, as well as better technology 
and more efficient processes for our employees. 

 To 
execute the 
transformation project, 
we plan 
to expand 
our digital 
capabilities, modernize 
our technology 
foundation, 
 and 
implement 
agile 
and 
efficient 
business 
processes 
across 
the 
entire 
company. 
We 
may 
not 
succeed 
in 
executing 
the 
 transformation project, may fail 
to properly estimate cost 
of the same, or 
may experience delays in 
executing our plans, which 
may 
 in turn 
cause the 
Corporation to 
incur costs 
exceeding our 
current estimates 
or disrupt 
our operations, 
including our 
technological 
 services to our customers, or fall short 
of our projected earnings targets driven by these 
efforts. To 
the extent that these disruptions 
 persist over time and/or recur, this could negatively impact our competitive 
position, require additional expenditures, and/or harm 
our 
 relationships 
with 
our 
customers 
and 
thus 
may 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
 operations, or cause reputational harm. 
 We face significant and increasing competition in the 
rapidly evolving financial services industry. 
 
We 
operate 
in 
a 
highly competitive 
environment, in 
which 
we 
compete 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
number of 
factors, 
including 
 customer service, 
quality and variety 
of products 
and services, 
price, interest rates 
on loans 
and deposits, 
innovation, technology, 
 ease of use, reputation, and transaction execution. While our main competition 
continues to come from other Puerto Rico banks and 
 financial 
institutions, 
we 
may 
face 
increased 
competition 
from 
other 
institutions 
in 
the 
future 
as 
emerging 
technologies 
and 
the 
 growth of e-commerce have significantly reduced geographic barriers, made it easier for non-depositary institutions to offer products 
 and 
services 
that 
traditionally 
were 
banking 
products 
and 
allowed 
non-traditional 
financial 
service 
providers 
and 
technology 
 companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services. Increased competition could create 
pressure to 
 lower 
prices, 
fees, 
commissions 
or 
credit 
standards 
on 
our 
products 
and 
services, 
which 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
 condition and results of operations. Increased competition could also 
create pressure to raise interest rates on deposits, which could 
 also impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we are unable to 
meet constant technological changes and react quickly to 
meet new industry standards, including as a 
 result 
of our 
continued dependence 
on 
Evertec, we 
may 
be unable 
to enhance 
our 
current services 
and introduce 
new 
 products and 
services in 
a timely 
and cost-effective 
manner, 
placing us 
at a 
competitive disadvantage 
and significantly 
 affecting our business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
 To compete effectively, 
we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products 
 and 
services 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
clients 
or 
to 
match 
products 
and 
services 
offered 
by 
our 
competitors, 
including 
technology 
 companies and 
other nonbank 
firms that 
are engaged 
in providing 
similar products 
and services. 
Although the 
Evertec Business 
 Acquisition Transaction eliminated certain 
provisions of a previous Master Services 
Agreement with Evertec that required 
us to use 
 Evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or 
enhanced products and services, and is expected to 
improve Popular s ability 
 to manage 
and control 
the development 
of the 
customer channels 
supported by 
the Acquired 
Assets, Popular 
expects that 
it will 
 continue to depend 
on Evertec s technology services 
to operate and 
control current products and 
services and to 
implement future 
 products and 
services, making 
our success 
dependent on 
Evertec s ability 
to timely 
complete and 
introduce these 
enhancements 
 and 
new 
products 
and 
services 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner. 
Our 
ability 
to 
enhance our 
customer channels 
is 
also 
dependent 
on 
 Evertec timely delivering Core 
APIs that meet BPPR s 
requirements, which Evertec has committed 
to develop under the 
MSA. The 
 Core APIs are necessary for BPPR to connect 
future enhancements to the Acquired Assets to existing 
Evertec core applications. 

 Some 
of 
our 
competitors 
rely 
on 
financial 
services 
technology 
and 
outsourcing 
companies 
that 
are 
much 
larger 
than 
 Evertec, serve a 
greater number of 
clients than Evertec, 
and may have 
better technological capabilities and 
product offerings than 
 Evertec. 
Furthermore, 
financial 
services 
technology 
companies 
typically 
make 
capital 
investments 
to 
develop 
and 
modify 
their 
 product 
and 
service 
offerings 
to 
facilitate 
their 
customers 
compliance 
with 
the 
extensive 
and 
evolving 
regulatory 
and 
industry 
 requirements, 
and 
in 
most cases 
such 
costs 
are 
borne 
by 
the 
technology provider. 
Because 
of 
our 
contractual 
relationship with 
 Evertec, and because Popular is the 
sole customer of certain of 
Evertec s services and products, we 
have in the past borne 
the full 
 cost of such developments and modifications and 
may be required to do so in the future, subject 
to the terms of the MSA. 
 Moreover, 
the terms, 
speed, scalability, 
and functionality 
of certain 
of Evertec s 
technology services 
are not 
competitive 
 when compared 
to offerings 
from its 
competitors. Evertec s 
failure to 
sufficiently invest 
in and 
upscale its 
technology and 
services 
 infrastructure to 
meet the 
rapidly changing 
technology demands 
of our 
industry may 
result in 
us being 
unable to 
meet 
customer 
 expectations and attract 
or retain customers. 
Any such impact 
could, in turn, 
reduce Popular s revenues, place 
us in a 
competitive 

36 
 disadvantage and 
significantly affect 
our 
business, financial 
condition and 
results of 
operations. While 
the closing 
of 
the Evertec 
 Business Acquisition 
Transaction narrowed 
the scope 
of services 
which we 
are dependent 
on Evertec 
to obtain 
and released 
us 
 from 
exclusivity 
restrictions 
that 
limited 
our 
ability 
to 
engage 
other 
third-party 
providers 
of 
financial 
technology 
services, 
it 
also 
 resulted in extensions 
of certain existing 
commercial agreements with Evertec 
and, as a 
result, have prolonged 
the duration of 
our 
 exposure to 
the risks 
presented by 
Evertec s technological 
capabilities and 
its failures 
to 
enhance its 
products and 
services 
and 
 otherwise meet evolving demands. 
 The ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
is critical to our success. 
 Our 
success 
depends, 
in 
large 
part, 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
qualified 
employees. Competition 
for 
qualified 
 candidates is intense and has 
increased recently as a result 
of a tighter labor market. Increased competition 
may lead to difficulties 
 in 
attracting 
or 
retaining qualified 
employees, which 
may, 
in turn, 
lead to 
significant challenges 
in the 
execution 
of 
our 
business 
 strategies and 
have an 
adverse effect 
on the 
quality of the 
service we 
provide to 
the customers 
and communities we 
serve. Such 
 challenges could 
adversely affect 
our business, 
operations and 
financial condition. 
In addition, 
increased competition 
may lead 
to 
 higher compensation 
packages and 
more flexible 
work arrangements. 
We may 
also be 
required to 
hire employees 
outside of 
our 
 market 
areas 
for 
certain 
positions 
that 
require 
specific 
expertise, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
employment 
and 
tax 
compliance-related 
 expenses, challenges and 
risks. In 
addition, flexible 
work arrangements, such 
as remote 
or hybrid 
work models, have 
led to 
other 
 workplace 
challenges, 
including fewer 
opportunities 
for 
face-to-face interactions 
or 
to 
promote 
a 
cohesive 
corporate 
culture 
and 
 heightened cybersecurity, information security and other operational risks. 
 Our 
ability 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
qualified 
employees 
is 
also 
impacted 
by 
regulatory 
limitations 
on 
our 
compensation 
 practices, such a s clawback requirements of incentive compensation, 
which may not affect other institutions with which we compete 
 for talent. The 
scope and 
content of 
regulators policies 
on executive 
compensation continue to 
develop and 
are likely 
to continue 
 evolving. Such policies and limitations on our compensation 
practices could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate 
 talented senior leaders in support of our long-term 
strategy. 
 OTHER RISKS 
 An impairment 
of our 
goodwill, deferred 
tax assets 
or amortizable 
intangible assets 
could adversely 
affect our 
financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 
2022, we had approximately 827 
million, 954 million and 
 94 million, respectively, 
of goodwill, net 
 deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets 
recorded on our balance sheet. 
 Under 
GAAP, 
goodwill 
is 
tested 
for 
impairment 
at 
least 
annually 
and 
amortizable 
intangible 
assets 
are 
tested 
for 
 impairment 
when 
events 
or 
changes 
in 
circumstances indicate 
the 
carrying value 
may 
not 
be 
recoverable. Factors 
that 
may 
be 
 considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be 
 recoverable, include 
a decline in 
Popular s stock price 
related to 
a deterioration in 
global or 
local economic conditions, 
declines in 
 our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, and interest rate changes. The goodwill impairment evaluation process 
 requires 
us 
to 
make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
reporting 
units. 
Actual 
values 
may 
differ 
 significantly 
from 
these 
estimates. 
Such 
differences 
could 
result 
in 
future 
impairment 
of 
goodwill 
that 
would, 
in 
turn, 
negatively 
 impact our results of operations and the reporting 
unit where the goodwill is recorded. 
 The 
determination 
of 
whether 
a 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
is 
realizable 
is 
based 
on 
weighting 
all 
available 
evidence. 
The 
 realization 
of 
deferred 
tax 
assets, including 
carryforwards 
and 
deductible temporary 
differences, 
depends upon 
the 
existence 
of 
 sufficient taxable 
income of the 
same character during 
the carryback or 
carryforward period. The 
analysis considers all 
sources of 
 taxable income 
available to 
realize the 
deferred tax 
asset, including 
the future 
reversal of 
existing taxable 
temporary differences, 
 future taxable income 
exclusive of reversing temporary 
differences and carryforwards, 
taxable income in 
prior carryback years and 
 tax-planning strategies. Changes in these 
factors may affect 
the realizability of our 
deferred tax assets in 
our Puerto Rico and 
U.S. 
 operations. 
 If our 
goodwill, deferred 
tax assets 
or amortizable 
intangible assets 
become impaired, 
we may 
be required 
to record 
a 
 significant charge to earnings, which could adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We could experience unexpected 
losses if the estimates 
or assumptions we use 
in preparing our financial 
statements are 
 incorrect or differ materially from actual results. 
 In preparing 
our financial 
statements pursuant 
to U.S. 
GAAP, 
we are 
required to 
make estimates 
and assumptions 
that 
 are often based 
on subjective and 
complex judgments about 
matters that are 
inherently uncertain. For example, 
we use estimates 

37 
 and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our 
liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain 
 of our 
assets and 
liabilities, such 
as debt 
securities, loans 
held for 
sale, MSRs, 
intangible assets 
and deferred 
tax assets. 
If such 
 estimates 
or 
assumptions are 
incorrect 
or 
differ 
materially 
from 
actual 
results, 
we 
could 
experience 
unexpected 
losses 
or 
other 
 adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.

 PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Common Stock 
 Popular s Common Stock is traded on 
the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol BPOP . 

 During 2022, the Corporation declared cash dividends in the 
total amount of 2.20 per common share outstanding, 
for an 
 aggregate amount of 163.7 
million. The Common Stock ranks junior to all series of Preferred Stock as 
to dividend rights and rights 
 on liquidation, 
dissolution or 
winding up 
of Popular. 
Our ability 
to declare 
or pay 
dividends on, 
or purchase, 
redeem or 
otherwise 
 acquire, the Common 
Stock is subject 
to certain restrictions 
in the event 
that Popular fails 
to pay or 
set aside full 
dividends on the 
 Preferred Stock for the latest dividend period. 
 On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed an accelerated share repurchase ASR program for the repurchase of an 
 aggregate 400 
million of 
Popular s common stock 
for which 
an initial 
delivery of 
3,483,942 shares 
were delivered 
in March 
2022 
 (the 
 March 
ASR 
Agreement ). 
Upon 
the 
final 
settlement 
of 
the 
March 
ASR 
Agreement, 
the 
Corporation 
received 
an 
additional 
 1,582,922 
shares 
of 
common 
stock. 
The 
Corporation 
repurchased a 
total 
of 
5,066,864 shares 
at 
an 
average 
purchase 
price 
of 
 78.9443, which were recorded as treasury 
stock by 440 million under the March ASR 
Agreement. 
 On December 
7, 2022 
the Corporation 
completed the 
settlement of 
another ASR 
Agreement for 
the repurchase 
of an 
 aggregate 231 
million of 
Popular s common stock, 
for which 
an initial 
2,339,241 shares 
were delivered 
on August 
26, 2022 
(the 
 August ASR Agreement ). Upon the final settlement of the ASR Agreement, the Corporation received an additional 840,024 shares 
 of common 
stock. The 
Corporation repurchased 
a total 
of 3,179,265 
shares at 
an average 
purchase price 
of 72.66, 
which were 
 recorded as treasury stock by 245 million under 
the August ASR Agreement. 
 On September 9, 2021, the Corporation completed an accelerated share repurchase ASR program 
for the repurchase 
 of 
an 
aggregate 350 
million 
of Popular s 
common 
stock. 
Under the 
terms 
of 
the 
accelerated share 
repurchase 
agreement (the 
 ASR 
Agreement ), 
on 
May 
4, 
2021, 
the 
Corporation made 
an 
initial 
payment 
of 
 350 
million 
and 
received 
an 
initial 
delivery 
of 
 3,785,831 
shares 
of 
Popular s 
Common 
Stock 
(the 
 Initial 
Shares ). 
The 
transaction 
was 
accounted 
for 
as 
a 
treasury 
stock 
 transaction. As 
a result 
of the 
receipt of 
the Initial 
Shares, the 
Corporation recognized in 
shareholders equity 
approximately 280 
 million 
in treasury 
stock 
and 
 70 
million 
as 
a 
reduction in 
capital surplus. 
Upon the 
final 
settlement of 
the 
ASR 
Agreement, the 
 Corporation received an additional 828,965 shares and recognized 61 million as treasury stock with a corresponding increase in its 
 capital surplus account. The Corporation repurchased a total of 4,614,796 shares at an average purchase price of 75.84 
under the 
 ASR Agreement. 
 Additional information concerning legal or 
regulatory restrictions on the payment 
of dividends by Popular, 
BPPR and PB 
 is contained under the caption Regulation and Supervision 
in Item 1 herein. 
 As 
of 
February 
24, 
2023, 
Popular 
had 
6,612 
stockholders 
of 
record 
of 
the 
Common 
Stock, 
not 
including 
beneficial 
 owners whose shares 
are held in 
record names 
of brokers 
or other 
nominees. The last 
sales price 
for the 
Common Stock 
on that 
 date was 71.27 per share. 
 Preferred Stock 
 Popular has 30,000,000 shares of 
authorized Preferred Stock that may 
be issued in one 
or more series, and the 
shares 
 of each series 
shall have such 
rights and preferences as 
shall be fixed 
by the Board 
of Directors when authorizing 
the issuance of 
 that particular series. Popular s Preferred Stock 
issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 
consisted of: 

885,726 shares of 6.375 non-cumulative monthly income Preferred Stock, Series A, no par value, liquidation preference 
 value of 25 per share. 

39 
 All series of 
Preferred Stock are pari 
passu. Dividends on each 
series of Preferred Stock 
are payable if declared 
by our 
 Board 
of 
Directors. 
Our 
ability 
to 
declare 
and 
pay 
dividends 
on 
the 
Preferred 
Stock 
is 
dependent 
on 
certain 
Federal 
regulatory 
 considerations, 
including 
the 
guidelines 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
regarding 
capital 
adequacy 
and 
dividends. 
The 
Board 
of 
 Directors is not obligated to declare dividends and 
dividends do not accumulate in the event 
they are not paid. 
 Monthly 
dividends 
on 
the 
Preferred 
Stock 
amounted 
to 
a 
total 
of 
 1.4 
million 
for 
the 
year 
2022. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
 assurance that any dividends will be declared on 
the Preferred Stock in any future periods. 
 Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
 Popular offers 
a dividend 
reinvestment and 
stock purchase 
plan for 
our stockholders 
that allows 
them to 
reinvest their 
 dividends in 
shares of 
the Common Stock 
at a 
5 discount 
from the 
average market 
price at 
the time 
of the 
issuance, as well 
as 
 purchase shares of Common Stock directly from Popular 
by making optional cash payments at prevailing 
market prices. 
 Equity Based Plans 
 On May 
12, 2020, the 
stockholders of 
the Corporation 
approved the Popular, 
Inc. 2020 
Omnibus Incentive Plan, 
which 
 permits the 
Corporation to issue 
several types of 
stock-based compensation to 
employees and directors 
of the Corporation 
and/or

 Florida. Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements presents information about the Corporation s business 
segments. 
 YEAR 2022 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 
 Acquisition of Key Customer Channels and Amendments 
to Commercial Contracts with Evertec 
 On July 1, 2022, BPPR completed the announced acquisition of certain assets from Evertec Group, LLC Evertec Group ), a wholly 
 owned 
subsidiary 
of 
Evertec, 
Inc. Evertec 
(NYSE: 
EVTC), 
to 
service 
certain 
BPPR 
channels 
(the 
 Business 
Acquisition 
 Transaction ). 
 As 
a 
result 
of 
the closing 
of 
the Business 
Acquisition Transaction, 
BPPR 
acquired 
from 
Evertec Group 
certain critical 
channels, 
 including 
BPPR s 
retail 
and 
business 
digital 
banking 
and 
commercial 
cash 
management 
applications. 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
 Business Acquisition Transaction, BPPR 
also entered into amended and 
restated service agreements with Evertec Group 
pursuant 
 to 
which 
Evertec 
Group 
will 
continue 
to 
provide 
various 
information 
technology 
and 
transaction 
processing 
services 
to 
Popular, 
 BPPR and their respective subsidiaries. 
 Under the 
amended service 
agreements, Evertec 
Group no 
longer has 
exclusive rights 
to provide 
certain of 
Popular s technology 
 services. The 
amended service 
agreements include 
discounted pricing 
and lowered 
caps on 
contractual pricing 
escalators tied 
to 
 the Consumer Price Index. As 
part of the transaction, BPPR and Evertec 
also entered into a revenue sharing 
structure for BPPR in 
 connection 
with 
its 
merchant 
acquiring 
relationship 
with 
Evertec. 
Under 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
amended 
and 
restated 
Master 
Service 
 Agreement MSA ), Evertec will be entitled to receive monthly payments 
from the Corporation to the extent that Evertec s revenues, 
 covered under the MSA, fall below certain agreed 
annualized minimum amounts. 
 As consideration for the 
Business Acquisition Transaction, BPPR delivered 
to Evertec Group 4,589,169 shares 
of Evertec common 
 stock valued at closing at 169.2 million (based on Evertec s stock price on June 30, 2022 of 36.88). A total of 144.8 million of the 
 consideration for 
the transaction 
was attributed 
to the 
acquisition of 
the critical 
channels of 
which 28.7 
million were 
attributed to 
 software 
intangible 
assets 
and 
 116.1 
million 
were 
attributed 
to 
goodwill. 
The 
transaction 
was 
accounted 
for 
as 
a 
business 
 combination. 
The 
remaining 
 24.2 
million 
was 
attributed 
to 
the 
renegotiation of 
the 
MSA 
with 
Evertec 
and 
was 
recorded 
as 
an 

52 
 expense. The Corporation also recorded a credit of 6.9 million in Evertec billings under the MSA during the third quarter of 2022 as 
 a result of the Business Acquisition Transaction, resulting in a net 
expense charge for the quarter of 17.3 
million. 
 On 
August 
15, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
completed 
the 
sale 
of 
its 
remaining 
7,065,634 
shares 
of 
common 
stock 
of 
Evertec 
(the 
 Evertec Stock Sale , and collectively 
with the Business Acquisition Transaction, 
the Evertec Transactions ). Following 
the Evertec 
 Stock 
Sale, Popular 
no longer 
owns any 
Evertec common 
stock. The 
impact of 
the 
gain on 
the sale 
of 
Evertec shares 
used as 
 consideration 
for 
the 
Business 
Acquisition 
Transaction 
in 
exchange 
for 
the 
acquired 
applications 
on 
July 
1, 
2022 
and 
the 
net 
 expense associated with the renegotiation of the MSA resulted in an 
after-tax gain of 97.9 million, while the Evertec Stock Sale and 
 the related 
accounting adjustments resulted 
in an after-tax 
gain of 128.8 
million, recorded during 
the third quarter 
of 2022, for 
an 
 aggregate after-tax gain of 226.6 million. 
 Transformation Initiative:
 Leveraging the completion 
of the Evertec 
Transactions, the 
Corporation embarked on 
a broad-based multi-year, 
technological and 
 business 
process 
transformation 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2022. 
The 
needs 
and 
expectations 
of 
our 
clients, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 competitive landscape, have evolved, requiring us to make important investments in our technological infrastructure and adopt more 
 agile practices. 
Our technology and business 
transformation will be a 
significant priority for the 
company over the next 
three years 
 and beyond. 
 Through December 
31, 2022, 
excluding compensation 
costs of 
our employees 
involved in 
the initiative, 
we expensed 
 24 million 
 toward this effort, 
primarily in professional 
fees and technology 
related expenses. As 
part of this 
transformation, we aim 
to expand 
 our digital capabilities, 
modernize our technology 
platform, and implement 
agile and efficient 
business processes across 
the entire 
 company. 
In 
2023, 
we 
plan 
an 
expense 
of 
approximately 
 50 
million 
toward 
this 
effort, 
excluding 
employee 
compensation 
and 
 capitalized costs. 
We 
expect the 
expenses tied 
to 
this transformation 
initiative, which 
will continue 
through 2025 
to 
result in 
an 
 enhanced digital experience for our clients, as well as better technology and more efficient processes for our employees. We expect 
 this effort to contribute to better efficiency 
and higher earnings, resulting in a targeted sustainable return on tangible common equity 
 of 14 by the end of 2025. 

 To 
facilitate 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
progress 
with 
these 
efforts, 
effective 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
 separated 
technology, 
professional 
fees 
and 
transactional 
activities 
as 
standalone 
expense 
categories 
in 
the 
accompanying 
 Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to additional 
information in the Operating expenses section 
of this MD A. 
 Capital Actions 
 On July 12, 
2022, the Corporation completed 
an accelerated share repurchase ASR program for the 
repurchase of 400 million 
 of 
Popular s 
common 
stock 
for 
which 
an 
initial 
delivery 
of 
3,483,942 
shares 
were 
delivered 
in 
March 
2022 
(the 
 March 
ASR 
 Agreement ). Upon 
the final 
settlement of 
the March 
ASR Agreement, 
the Corporation 
received an 
additional 1,582,922 shares 
of 
 common stock. 
The Corporation 
repurchased a 
total of 
5,066,864 shares 
at an 
average purchase 
price of 
 78.9443, which 
were 
 recorded as treasury stock by 440 million under 
the March ASR Agreement. 
 On December 7, 2022, the Corporation completed 
the settlement of another ASR agreement (the 
 August ASR Agreement for the 
 repurchase of 
 231 million 
of Popular s 
common stock, 
for which 
an initial 
2,339,241 shares 
were delivered 
on August 
26, 2022. 
 Upon the final 
settlement of the 
August ASR Agreement, the 
Corporation received an additional 
840,024 shares of common 
stock. 
 The Corporation repurchased a total of 
3,179,265 shares at an average purchase price 
of 72.66, which were recorded as treasury 
 stock by 245 million under the August ASR Agreement. 
 Hurricanes Fiona and Ian 
 On September 
18, 2022, 
Hurricane Fiona made 
landfall in 
the southwest 
area of 
Puerto Rico 
as a 
Category 1 
hurricane, bringing 
 record rainfall and flooding throughout the island and affecting communities where BPPR does business. Hurricane Fiona s rain and 
 winds 
caused 
a 
complete 
blackout 
on 
the 
island 
and 
caused 
considerable 
damage 
to 
certain 
sectors 
in 
the 
southwest 
region. 
 President 
Biden 
issued 
a 
disaster 
declaration 
for 
the 
island. 
While 
the 
impact 
to 
BPPR s 
operation 
was 
not 
material, 
certain 
 customers, highly concentrated in certain municipalities, were 
impacted by the disaster. 

53 
 As 
part 
of 
hurricane 
relief 
efforts 
on 
the 
island, 
the 
Corporation 
waived 
late-payment 
fees 
on 
individual 
lending 
products 
from 
 September 16 through October 31, 2022. Popular also waived, through September 30, withdrawal fees payable by our customers at 
 ATMs 
outside of 
the Popular 
network and 
fees payable 
by customers 
of other 
banking institutions 
at Popular s ATMs. 
In addition, 
 the Corporation 
offered to 
clients impacted 
by the 
hurricane a 
moratorium of 
up to 
three monthly 
payments, up 
to December 
31, 
 2022, on 
personal and 
commercial credit 
cards, auto 
loans, leases 
and personal 
loans, subject 
to certain 
eligibility requirements. 
 Mortgage clients 
may also 
benefit from 
different payment 
relief alternatives 
available, depending 
on their 
type of 
loan. Loan 
relief 
 options for commercial clients are reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis. 
 Separately, 
on September 28, 
2022, Hurricane Ian made 
a landfall on 
the west coast 
of central Florida 
as a Category 
4 hurricane, 
 causing extensive 
floods and 
destruction in 
the impacted 
areas in 
Florida. President 
Biden made 
a major 
disaster declaration 
for 
 certain counties 
in central 
Florida. PB 
and BPPR 
do not 
have significant 
operations in 
the area 
but have 
some limited 
retail and 
 commercial clients who reside or have business activities 
in the impacted areas. 
 For 
clients 
impacted 
by 
the 
hurricane 
that 
reside 
in 
counties 
in 
Florida declared 
as 
disaster zones 
by 
President 
Biden, 
Popular 
 offered a moratorium 
for up to 
three payments, up to 
January 31, 2023, subject 
to certain eligibility requirements. 
As in the case 
of 
 Puerto Rico, relief options for commercial clients 
are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
 Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD A 
for additional information of the loan moratorium 
offered to clients. 
 Transfer of Securities from Available-for Sale to Held-To-Maturity 
 In October 2022, the 
Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury securities 
with a fair value 
of 6.5 billion (par value 
of 7.4 billion) from 
 its available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. Management changed its intent, given its ability to hold these securities 
 to maturity 
due to 
the Corporation s 
liquidity position 
and its 
intention to 
reduce the 
impact on 
accumulated other 
comprehensive 
 income (loss) AOCI and tangible capital of further 
increases in interest rates. 
 The 
securities 
were reclassified 
at 
fair value 
at the 
time 
of 
the transfer. 
At 
the 
date of 
the transfer, 
these 
securities 
had 
pre-tax 
 unrealized 
losses 
of 
 873.0 
million 
recorded 
in 
AOCI. 
This 
fair 
value 
discount 
is 
being 
accreted 
to 
interest 
income 
and 
the 
 unrealized loss remaining in 
AOCI is being amortized, 
offsetting each other through 
the remaining life of 
the securities. There were 
 no realized gains or losses recorded as a result 
of this transfer. 

 While changes 
in the 
amount of 
unrealized gains 
and losses 
in AOCI 
have an 
impact on 
the Corporation s 
and its 
wholly-owned 
 banking 
subsidiaries 
tangible 
capital 
ratios, 
they 
do 
not 
impact 
regulatory 
capital 
ratios, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
regulatory 
 framework. 
Refer 
to 
Note 
7 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
which 
presents 
information 
about 
the 
Corporation s 
Debt 
 Securities Held-to-Maturity for additional details 
 Partial Release of the Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance 
 During the 
fourth quarter 
of 2022, 
the Corporation 
recorded a 
partial reversal 
of the 
deferred tax 
asset valuation 
allowance of 
the 
 U.S. operations of 68.2 million. As 
of December 31, 2022, the deferred tax 
asset DTA for 
the U.S. operations, mainly related to 
 net 
operating 
losses NOLs ), 
was 
valued 
at 
 278 
million, 
net 
of 
the 
corresponding 
valuation 
allowance 
of 
 402 
million. 
The 
 reversal during 
the fourth 
quarter was 
determined based 
on management s 
expectation of 
the realization 
of additional 
amounts of 
 federal 
and 
state 
NOLs 
over 
their 
remaining 
carryover 
period. 
The 
determination 
was 
based 
on 
the 
U.S. 
operations 
sustained 
 profitability during the 
years ended December 31, 
2021 and 2022, 
together with evidence of 
stable credit metrics 
and the length 
of 
 the expiration of the net operating losses. As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation had approximately 525 million in 
DTA related 
 to federal 
NOLs with 
expiration dates 
between 2028 
and 2033 
and approximately 
 135 million 
in DTA 
related to 
state NOLs 
with 
 expiration dates between 2030 and 2036.

 Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 

 Net 
interest 
income, 
on 
a 
taxable 
equivalent 
basis, 
is 
presented 
with 
its 
different 
components 
in 
Table 
3 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 31, 
2022 
as compared 
with 
the same 
period in 
2021, segregated 
by 
major categories 
of 
interest 
earning assets 
and 
 interest-bearing liabilities. 

 The interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The 
 main 
sources 
of 
tax-exempt 
interest 
income 
are 
certain 
investments 
in 
obligations 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Government, 
its 
agencies 
and 
 sponsored 
entities, 
and 
certain 
obligations 
of 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
its 
agencies 
and 
assets 
held 
by 
the 
 Corporation s international 
banking entities. 
To 
facilitate the 
comparison of 
all interest 
related to 
these assets, 
the interest 
income 
 has 
been 
converted 
to 
a 
taxable 
equivalent 
basis, 
using 
the 
applicable 
statutory 
income 
tax 
rates 
for 
each 
period. 
The 
taxable 
 equivalent computation 
considers the 
interest expense 
and other 
related expense 
disallowances required 
by the 
Puerto Rico 
tax 
 law. Under Puerto Rico tax law, 
the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable 
income. Net interest income, on a 
 taxable 
equivalent 
basis, 
is 
a 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measure. 
Management 
believes 
that 
this 
presentation 
provides 
meaningful 
 information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues 
arising from taxable and exempt sources. 
 Net interest 
income, on 
a taxable 
equivalent basis, 
as used 
by the 
Corporation may 
not be 
comparable to 
similarly named 
non-
 GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 Financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 
2022 
 The Corporation s net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to 
 1.1 billion, compared to a net income of 934.9 
 million for 2021. 
 The discussion 
that follows 
provides highlights 
of the 
Corporation s results 
of 
operations for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022 
 compared to the results of 
operations of 2021. It also 
provides some highlights with respect to 
the Corporation s financial condition, 
 credit 
quality, 
capital and 
liquidity.

 Net interest income for the 
year ended December 31, 2022 was 
 2.2 billion, an increase of 209.8 
million when compared to 2021. 
 The 
increase in 
net interest 
income was 
mainly 
driven 
by 
higher interest 
income 
from 
money market 
investments due 
to 
higher 
 interest rates, 
higher income 
from investment 
securities and 
higher interest 
income from 
commercial and 
consumer loans 
due to 
 higher volumes and 
yields. The 
net interest margin 
for the year 
ended December 31, 
2022 was 3.11 
 
compared to 2.88 
for the 
 same period in 2021, driven by higher average volume of earning assets 
and higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve increased 
 the Federal Funds Rate 
during 2022. 
On a taxable equivalent 
basis, net interest margin was 
3.46 in 2022, compared to 
3.19 in 
 2021. Refer to the Net Interest Income section 
of this MD A for additional information. 
 The 
Corporation s total 
provision for 
credit losses 
reflected an 
expense of 
 83.0 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, 
 compared to 
a reserve 
release of 
 193.5 million 
for 
2021. The 
expense for 
the year 
2022 
was mostly 
driven by 
changes in 
the 
 economic scenario, higher loan volumes 
and changes in credit 
quality. 
The Corporation continued to exhibit 
favorable credit quality 
 trends 
with 
low 
levels 
of 
net 
charge-offs 
and 
decreasing 
non-performing loans. 
Non-performing assets 
totaled 
 528.6 
million 
at 
 December 31, 2022, reflecting a decrease of 104.4 million when compared to December 31, 2021. Refer to the Provision for Credit 
 Losses and 
Credit Risk 
sections of 
this MD A 
for information 
on the 
allowance for 
credit losses, 
non-performing assets, 
troubled 
 debt restructurings, net charge-offs and credit quality metrics. 
 Non-interest 
income 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
amounted 
to 
 897.1 
million, 
an 
increase 
of 
 254.9 
million, 
when 
 compared with 2021, mostly due to: 
the 257.7 million gain related to the 
Evertec Transactions and related accounting adjustments 
 and 
higher 
service 
fees 
due 
to 
higher credit 
card 
fees 
and 
merchant 
network 
business fees 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
revenue sharing 
 agreement entered 
into 
in connection 
with the 
Evertec Transactions. 
Refer to 
the 
Non-Interest Income 
section of 
this 
MD A for 
 additional information on the major variances of 
the different categories of non-interest income. 
 Total 
operating expenses amounted to 1.7 billion for the year 2022, reflecting an increase of 
 197.1 million, when compared to the 
 same period 
in 2021, 
mainly due 
to higher 
personnel costs 
reflecting salary increases 
and a 
higher headcount, 
professional fees, 
 technology 
and 
software 
expenses, 
reflecting 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
investment 
in 
the 
transformation 
initiative, 
higher 
business 
 promotions expense 
driven by 
customer loyalty 
programs and 
a 17.3 
million expense 
associated with 
the Evertec 
Transactions. 
 Refer to the Operating Expenses section of this MD A 
for additional information. 
 Income tax expense 
amounted to 132.3 million 
for the year 
ended December 31, 2022, 
compared with an 
income tax expense of 
 309.0 million 
for the 
previous year. 
The decrease 
in income 
tax expense 
for the 
year is 
mainly due 
to 
the impact 
of the 
partial 
 reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of the U.S. Operations and, higher taxable income that was exempt or subject 
 to preferential tax rates. Refer to 
the Income Taxes 
section in this MD A and 
Note 35 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
 additional information 
on income taxes. 
 At December 
31, 2022, 
the Corporation s 
total assets 
were 67.6 
billion, compared 
with 75.1 
billion at 
December 31, 
2021. The 
 decrease of 7.5 billion is mainly driven by lower money market 
investments due to a decrease in deposits mainly 
in the Puerto Rico 

57 
 public sector, partially offset 
by an increase in loans held-in-portfolio mainly in the commercial and 
consumer portfolios. 
Refer to the 
 Statement of Financial Condition Analysis section of 
this MD A for additional information. 
 Deposits amounted to 
 61.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022, 
compared with 67.0 
billion at December 
31, 2021. Table 
8 presents a 
 breakdown of deposits 
by major categories. The 
decrease in deposits was 
mainly due to 
lower Puerto Rico 
public sector deposits. 
 The 
Corporation s 
borrowings 
amounted 
to 
 1.4 
billion 
at 
December 31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 1.2 
billion at 
December 31, 
2021. 
 Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for detailed information on the Corporation s 
borrowings. 
 Refer 
to 
Table 
7 
in 
the 
Statement 
of 
Financial 
Condition 
Analysis 
section 
of 
this 
MD A 
for 
the 
percentage 
allocation 
of 
the 
 composition of the Corporation s financing to total assets. 
 Stockholders equity amounted to 4.1 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 
 6.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease 
 was principally due to 
higher accumulated unrealized losses on debt 
securities available-for-sale and the impact of 
two accelerated 
 share 
repurchase 
transactions 
completed 
during 
2022, 
declared 
dividends, 
partially 
offset 
by 
net 
income 
for 
the 
year. 
The 
 Corporation and its 
banking subsidiaries continue to 
be well-capitalized at December 
31, 2022. The Common 
Equity Tier 
1 Capital 
 ratio at December 31, 2022 was 16.39 , compared 
to 17.42 at December 31, 2021. 
 For further discussion of operating results, financial 
condition and business risks refer to the narrative

herein. 
 The shares of the Corporation s common stock are traded 
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 
BPOP. 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 
 The accounting and 
reporting policies followed by 
the Corporation and its 
subsidiaries conform with generally 
accepted accounting 
 principles in 
the United 
States of America GAAP and 
general practices within 
the financial services 
industry. The 
Corporation s 
 significant 
accounting policies 
are described 
in 
detail in 
Note 2 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements and 
should 
be 
read in 
 conjunction with this section. 

 Critical accounting policies 
require management to 
make estimates and 
assumptions, which involve significant 
judgment about the 
 effect of matters 
that are inherently uncertain 
and that involve a 
high degree of subjectivity. 
These estimates are made 
under facts 
 and circumstances 
at a 
point in 
time and 
changes in 
those facts 
and circumstances 
could produce 
actual results 
that differ 
from 
 those 
estimates. The 
following MD A 
section is 
a summary 
of what 
management considers 
the Corporation s 
critical accounting 
 policies and estimates. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments 
 The Corporation 
currently measures 
at fair 
value on 
a recurring 
basis its 
trading debt 
securities, debt 
securities available-for-sale, 
 certain equity securities, 
derivatives and mortgage servicing 
rights. Occasionally, 
the Corporation is 
required to record 
at fair value 
 other assets 
on a 
nonrecurring basis, 
such as 
loans held-for-sale, loans 
held-in-portfolio that 
are collateral 
dependent and 
certain 
 other assets. These nonrecurring fair value 
adjustments typically result from the application of lower of 
cost or fair value accounting 
 or write-downs of individual assets. 

 The 
Corporation categorizes 
its 
assets and 
liabilities measured 
at fair 
value under 
the three-level 
hierarchy. 
The level 
within the 
 hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement 
are observable. 
 The 
Corporation 
requires 
the 
use 
of 
observable 
inputs 
when 
available, 
in 
order 
to 
minimize 
the 
use 
of 
unobservable 
inputs 
to 
 determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are 
not necessarily an indication of the risk associated 
 with investing 
in those 
securities. The 
amount of 
judgment involved 
in estimating 
the fair 
value of 
a financial 
instrument depends 
 upon the availability of 
quoted market prices or observable market 
parameters. In addition, it may 
be affected by other 
factors such 
 as the 
type of instrument, 
the liquidity of 
the market for 
the instrument, transparency 
around the inputs 
to the valuation, 
as well 
as 
 the 
contractual 
characteristics 
of 
the 
instrument. 
Broker 
quotes 
used 
for 
fair 
value 
measurements 
inherently 
reflect 
any 
lack 
of 
 liquidity in the market since they represent an exit 
price from the perspective of the market participants. 

58 
 Trading Debt Securities and Debt Securities Available-for-Sale 
 The 
majority 
of 
the 
values 
for 
trading 
debt 
securities 
and 
debt 
securities 
available-for-sale 
are 
obtained 
from 
third-party 
pricing 
 services and 
are validated 
with alternate 
pricing sources 
when available. 
Securities not 
priced by 
a secondary 
pricing source 
are 
 documented 
and 
validated 
internally 
according 
to 
their 
significance 
to 
the 
Corporation s 
financial 
statements. 
Management 
has 
 established materiality thresholds according to the investment class to monitor and investigate material deviations in prices obtained 
 from the primary pricing service provider and the 
secondary pricing source used as support for 
the valuation results. 

 Inputs are evaluated to 
ascertain that they consider current 
market conditions, including the 
relative liquidity of the 
market. When a 
 market quote 
for a 
specific security 
is not 
available, the 
pricing service 
provider generally 
uses observable 
data to 
derive an 
exit 
 price 
for 
the 
instrument, 
such 
as 
benchmark 
yield 
curves 
and 
trade 
data 
for 
similar 
products. 
To 
the 
extent 
trading 
data 
is 
not 
 available, the 
pricing service provider 
relies on specific 
information including dialogue 
with brokers, 
buy side clients, 
credit ratings, 
 spreads to 
established benchmarks and 
transactions on similar 
securities, to 
draw correlations based 
on the 
characteristics of 
the 
 evaluated instrument. If 
for any 
reason the pricing 
service provider cannot 
observe data required 
to feed 
its model, 
it discontinues 
 pricing the instrument. 
 Furthermore, management assesses the fair value of its 
portfolio of investment securities at least on a quarterly 
basis. Securities are 
 classified 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
hierarchy 
according 
to 
product 
type, 
characteristics 
and 
market 
liquidity. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
each 
period, 
 management assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. The fair 
value measurement analysis performed 
 by 
the 
Corporation 
includes 
validation 
procedures 
and 
review 
of 
market 
changes, 
pricing 
methodology, 
assumption 
and 
level 
 hierarchy changes, and evaluation of distressed transactions. 

 Refer to 
Note 28 
to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for 
a description of 
the Corporation s 
valuation methodologies used 
for 
 the assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 

 Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as 
interest income based upon the principal amount 
outstanding. 
 Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the 
accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is 
placed on non-accrual status, all 
 previously 
accrued 
and 
unpaid interest 
is 
charged against 
interest 
income 
and 
the 
loan 
is 
accounted for 
either 
on 
a cash-basis 
 method or 
on the 
cost-recovery method. 
Loans designated 
as non-accruing 
are returned 
to accrual 
status when 
the Corporation 
 expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. 
The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan s 
 balance may involve management s judgment in the evaluation of 
the borrower s financial condition and 
prospects for repayment. 
 Refer to 
the MD A 
section titled 
Credit Risk, 
particularly the 
Non-performing assets 
sub-section, for 
a detailed 
description of 
the 
 Corporation s non-accruing and charge-off policies by major loan 
categories. 

 One of 
the most 
critical and 
complex accounting 
estimates is 
associated with 
the determination 
of the 
allowance for 
credit losses 
 ACL ). 
The 
Corporation 
establishes 
an 
ACL 
for 
its 
loan 
portfolio 
based 
on 
its 
estimate 
of 
credit 
losses 
over 
the 
remaining 
 contractual term 
of the 
loans, adjusted 
for expected 
prepayments, in 
accordance with 
Accounting Standards 
Codification ASC 
 Topic 
326. 
An 
ACL 
is 
recognized 
for 
all 
loans 
including 
originated 
and 
purchased 
loans, 
since 
inception, 
with 
a 
corresponding 
 charge 
to 
the 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses, 
except 
for 
purchased 
credit 
deteriorated PCD 
loans 
as 
explained 
below. 
The 
 Corporation follows a methodology to establish the ACL which includes a reasonable and 
supportable forecast period for estimating 
 credit 
losses, 
considering 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
factors 
as 
well 
as 
the 
economic 
outlook. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
methodology, 
 management evaluates 
various macroeconomic 
scenarios provided 
by third 
parties. At 
December 31, 
2022, management 
applied 
 probability weights to the outcome of the selected 
scenarios. 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
designated 
as 
collateral 
dependent 
loans 
secured 
by 
collateral 
when 
foreclosure 
is 
probable 
or 
when 
 foreclosure is 
not probable but 
the practical expedient 
is used. 
The practical expedient 
is used 
when repayment is 
expected to 
be 
 provided 
substantially 
by 
the 
sale 
or 
operation 
of 
the 
collateral 
and 
the 
borrower is 
experiencing financial 
difficulty. 
The 
ACL 
of 
 collateral dependent loans 
is measured based 
on the fair 
value of the 
collateral less costs 
to sell. The 
fair value of 
the collateral is 
 based on appraisals, which may be adjusted due to their 
age, and the type, location, and condition of the 
property or area or general 
 market conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date of the appraisal and the measurement date. 
In 
 addition, refer 
to the 
Credit Risk 
section of 
this MD A 
for detailed 
information on 
the Corporation s 
collateral value 
estimation for 
 other real estate. 

59 
 A restructuring constitutes a TDR when the Corporation 
separately concludes that the restructuring constitutes a 
concession and the 
 debtor 
is 
experiencing financial 
difficulties. 
For 
information on 
the Corporation s 
TDR 
policy, 
refer 
to 
Note 
2 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
 Financial Statements. The established framework captures the impact of 
concessions through discounting modified contractual cash 
 flows, 
both 
principal 
and 
interest, 
at 
the 
loan s 
original 
effective 
rate. 
The 
impact 
of 
these 
concessions 
is 
combined 
with 
the 
 expected credit losses generated by the quantitative loss 
models in order to arrive at the ACL. 
 Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality 

 PCD loans are defined as those with evidence of a more-than-insignificant 
deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans 
 are initially recorded 
at its purchase 
price plus an 
estimated ACL. Upon 
the acquisition of 
a PCD loan, 
the Corporation recognizes 
 the 
estimate 
of 
the 
expected 
credit 
losses 
over 
the 
remaining 
contractual 
term 
of 
each 
individual 
loan 
as 
an 
ACL 
with 
a 
 corresponding addition to the 
loan purchase price. The 
amount of the purchased 
premium or discount which 
is not related to 
credit 
 risk 
is 
amortized 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
loan 
through 
net 
interest 
income 
using 
the 
effective 
interest 
method 
or 
a 
method 
that 
 approximates the effective interest method. Changes in 
expected credit losses are recorded as an 
increase or decrease to the ACL 
 with a corresponding charge 
(reverse) to the provision 
for credit losses in 
the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations. These loans 
 follow the same nonaccrual policies as non-PCD loans. Modifications of PCD 
loans that meet the definition of a 
TDR are accounted 
 and reported as such following the same processes 
as non-PCD loans. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income 
taxes 
are 
accounted 
for 
using 
the 
asset 
and 
liability 
method. 
Under 
this 
method, 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
 recognized based 
on the 
future tax 
consequences attributable 
to temporary 
differences 
between the 
financial statement 
carrying 
 amounts 
of 
existing 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
their 
respective 
tax 
basis, 
and 
attributable 
to 
operating 
loss 
and 
tax 
credit 
 carryforwards. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates 
expected to apply in 
the years in 
which the 
 temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates 
 is recognized in earnings in the period when 
the changes are enacted. 

 The 
calculation 
of 
periodic 
income 
taxes 
is 
complex 
and 
requires 
the 
use 
of 
estimates 
and 
judgments. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
 recorded 
two 
accruals 
for 
income 
taxes: 
(i) 
the 
net 
estimated 
amount 
currently 
due 
or 
to 
be 
received 
from 
taxing 
jurisdictions, 
 including 
any 
reserve 
for 
potential 
examination 
issues, 
and 
(ii) 
a 
deferred 
income 
tax 
that 
represents 
the 
estimated 
impact 
of 
 temporary differences between how the Corporation recognizes assets and 
liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted 
 in 
the 
United 
States 
(GAAP), 
and 
how 
such 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
recognized 
under 
the 
tax 
code. 
Differences 
in 
the 
actual 
 outcome of these future tax consequences could impact the Corporation s financial position or its results of operations. In estimating 
 taxes, management assesses the relative 
merits and risks of 
the appropriate tax treatment of 
transactions taking into consideration 
 statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. 

 A deferred 
tax asset 
should be 
reduced by 
a valuation 
allowance if based 
on the 
weight of 
all available evidence, 
it is 
more likely 
 than 
not 
(a 
likelihood 
of 
more 
than 
50 
that 
some 
portion 
or 
the 
entire 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
will 
not 
be 
realized. 
The 
valuation 
 allowance 
should 
be 
sufficient 
to 
reduce 
the 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
to 
the 
amount 
that 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
not 
to 
be 
realized. 
The 
 determination of whether a deferred 
tax asset is realizable is 
based on weighting all 
available evidence, including both positive and 
 negative evidence. 
The realization 
of deferred 
tax assets, 
including carryforwards 
and deductible 
temporary differences, 
depends 
 upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The realization of 
 deferred tax assets requires 
the consideration of all 
sources of taxable income 
available to realize the 
deferred tax asset, including 
 the 
future 
reversal 
of 
existing 
temporary 
differences, 
future 
taxable 
income 
exclusive 
of 
reversing 
temporary 
differences 
and 
 carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and 
tax-planning strategies. 
 Management evaluates the 
realization of the 
deferred tax asset 
by taxing 
jurisdiction. The U.S. 
mainland operations are 
evaluated 
 as 
a whole 
since a 
consolidated income 
tax return 
is filed; 
on the 
other 
hand, the 
deferred tax 
asset related 
to the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 operations 
is evaluated 
on an 
entity by 
entity basis, 
since 
no consolidation 
is 
allowed in 
the income 
tax filing. 
Accordingly, 
this 
 evaluation 
is 
composed 
of 
three 
major 
components: 
U.S. 
mainland 
operations, 
Puerto 
Rico 
banking 
operations 
and 
Holding 
 Company. 

60 
 For the 
evaluation of 
the realization 
of the 
deferred tax 
asset by 
taxing jurisdiction, 
refer to 
Note 35 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
 Statements. 
 Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the 
Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable 
entities and are 
 not entitled to file 
consolidated tax returns. The Code 
provides a dividends-received deduction of 100 
on dividends received from 
 controlled subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico 
and 85 on dividends received from other 
taxable domestic corporations. 

 Changes in 
the Corporation s 
estimates can occur 
due to changes 
in tax 
rates, new business 
strategies, newly 
enacted guidance, 
 and resolution 
of issues 
with taxing 
authorities regarding 
previously taken tax 
positions. Such 
changes could 
affect the 
amount of 
 accrued taxes. The Corporation has made 
tax payments in accordance with 
estimated tax payments rules. Any remaining 
payment 
 will not have any significant impact on liquidity 
and capital resources. 
 The valuation 
of deferred 
tax assets 
requires judgment 
in assessing 
the likely 
future tax 
consequences of 
events that 
have been 
 recognized 
in 
the 
financial 
statements 
or 
tax 
returns 
and 
future 
profitability. 
The 
accounting 
for 
deferred 
tax 
consequences 
 represents management s best 
estimate of those 
future events. Changes 
in management s current 
estimates, due to 
unanticipated 
 events, could have a material impact on the 
Corporation s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite its assessment that the tax 
 return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, the Corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax 
 benefit of certain 
positions if challenged. 
In evaluating 
a tax position, 
the Corporation determines 
whether it is 
more likely than 
not 
 that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution 
of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the 
 technical 
merits 
of 
the 
position. 
The 
Corporation s 
estimate 
of 
the 
ultimate 
tax 
liability 
contains 
assumptions 
based 
on 
past 
 experiences, and judgments 
about potential actions 
by taxing jurisdictions 
as well as 
judgments about the 
likely outcome of 
issues 
 that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax 
position is measured as the largest amount of benefit 
that is greater than 50 
 likely of being 
realized upon ultimate settlement. 
The Corporation evaluates these 
uncertain tax positions each 
quarter and adjusts 
 the related tax liabilities or 
assets in light of changing 
facts and circumstances, such as the 
progress of a tax audit 
or the expiration 
 of a 
statute of 
limitations. The Corporation 
believes the 
estimates and assumptions 
used to 
support its 
evaluation of 
uncertain tax 
 positions are reasonable. 
 The amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits 
may increase or 
decrease in the 
future for various 
reasons including adding amounts 
for 
 current 
tax 
year 
positions, 
expiration 
of 
open 
income 
tax 
returns 
due 
to 
the 
statutes 
of 
limitation, 
changes 
in 
management s 
 judgment about 
the level 
of uncertainty, 
status of 
examinations, litigation 
and legislative 
activity and 
the addition 
or elimination 
of 
 uncertain tax 
positions. Although 
the 
outcome of 
tax audits 
is uncertain, 
the Corporation 
believes that 
adequate amounts 
of tax, 
 interest and penalties 
have been provided 
for any adjustments 
that are expected 
to result from 
open years. From 
time to time, 
the 
 Corporation is audited 
by various federal, state 
and local authorities regarding 
income tax matters. Although 
management believes 
 its 
approach 
in 
determining the 
appropriate 
tax 
treatment 
is 
supportable 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
accounting standards, 
it 
is 
 possible that the final tax 
authority will take a tax position that 
is different than the tax 
position reflected in the Corporation s income 
 tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any, 
are appropriately recorded in the consolidated 
 financial 
statement 
in 
the 
period 
determined. 
Such 
differences 
could 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
income 
tax 
 provision or 
benefit, or 
other tax 
reserves, in 
the reporting 
period in 
which such 
determination is 
made and, 
consequently, 
on the 
 Corporation s results of operations, financial position and 
/ or cash flows for such period. 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 The 
Corporation s 
goodwill 
and 
other 
identifiable 
intangible 
assets 
having 
an 
indefinite 
useful 
life 
are 
tested 
for 
impairment. 
 Intangibles 
with 
indefinite 
lives 
are 
evaluated 
for 
impairment 
at 
least 
annually, 
and 
on 
a 
more 
frequent 
basis, 
if 
events 
or 
 circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place. 
Such events could include, among others, a 
significant adverse change 
 in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator, 
an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to 
 change 
the 
operations 
or 
dispose 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit. 
Other 
identifiable 
intangible 
assets 
with 
a 
finite 
useful 
life 
are 
evaluated 
 periodically for impairment when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. 

 Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of any 
of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up 
to the amount of 
 the 
goodwill. 
The 
Corporation 
estimates 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit, 
consistent 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
fair 
value 
 measurements 
accounting 
standard, 
generally 
using 
a 
combination 
of 
methods, 
including 
market 
price 
multiples 
of 
comparable 
 companies and 
transactions, as 
well as 
discounted cash 
flow analyses. 
Subsequent reversal 
of goodwill 
impairment losses 
is not 

61 
 permitted under applicable accounting standards. For a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed 
 by the Corporation during the third quarter of 2022, 
refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
 Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 
 The Corporation provides pension and 
restoration benefit plans for certain employees 
of various subsidiaries. The Corporation also 
 provides certain 
health care 
benefits for 
retired employees of 
BPPR. The 
non-contributory defined pension 
and benefit 
restoration 
 plans the Pension Plans are frozen with regards 
to all future benefit accruals. 

 The estimated 
benefit costs 
and obligations 
of the 
Pension Plans and 
Postretirement Health 
Care Benefit Plan OPEB Plan are 
 impacted by 
the use 
of subjective 
assumptions, which can 
materially affect 
recorded amounts, including 
expected returns on 
plan 
 assets, 
discount 
rates, 
termination 
rates, 
retirement 
rates 
and 
health 
care 
trend 
rates. 
Management 
applies 
judgment 
in 
the 
 determination of these factors, which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the 
actual experience of the 
 Corporation. 
The 
Corporation 
uses 
an 
independent 
actuarial 
firm 
for 
assistance 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
Pension 
Plans 
and 
 OPEB Plan 
costs and 
obligations. Detailed information 
on the Plans 
and related valuation 
assumptions are included 
in Note 
30 to 
 the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 The Corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the long-term expected return on Pension Plans 
assets. The Pension Plans 
 assets 
fair 
value 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 
 619.9 
million. 
The 
expected 
return 
on 
plan 
assets 
is 
determined 
by 
considering 
 various factors, including a total fund return estimate based on a weighted-average 
of estimated returns for each asset class in each 
 plan. 
Asset 
class 
returns 
are 
estimated 
using 
current 
and 
projected 
economic 
and 
market 
factors 
such 
as 
real 
rates 
of 
return, 
 inflation, credit spreads, equity risk premiums and 
excess return expectations. 

 As part of the review, 
the Corporation s independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns 
based on each 
 plan s expected asset 
allocation for the year 
2023 using the 
Willis Towers 
Watson US Expected 
Return Estimator. 
This analysis is 
 reviewed by the Corporation 
and used as a 
tool to develop expected 
rates of return, together 
with other data. This 
forecast reflects 
 the actuarial firm s view of 
expected long-term rates of return for each significant asset 
class or economic indicator as of January 
1, 
 2023; 
for 
example, 8.5 
for 
large 
cap 
stocks, 
8.8 for 
small cap 
stocks, 
9.0 for 
international stocks, 
6.1 for 
long 
corporate 
 bonds 
and 
4.9 
for 
long 
Treasury 
bonds. 
A 
range 
of 
expected 
investment 
returns 
is 
developed, 
and 
this 
range 
relies 
both 
on 
 forecasts and on broad-market historical benchmarks 
for expected returns, correlations, and volatilities 
for each asset class. 

 As a consequence of recent 
reviews, the Corporation increased its expected return 
on plan assets for year 
2023 to 5.9 and 6.5 
 for the Pension 
Plans. Expected rates 
of return of 
4.3 and 5.4 
had been used 
for 2022 and 
4.6 and 5.5 
had been used 
for 
 2021 for the Pension Plans. Since the expected return assumption is on a long-term basis, it is not materially impacted by the yearly 
 fluctuations (either positive or negative) in the actual 
return on assets. The expected return can be materially 
impacted by a change 
 in the plan s asset allocation. 
 Net Periodic 
Benefit Cost pension expense 
for the 
Pension Plans 
amounted to 
a net 
benefit of 
 0.5 million 
in 2022. 
The total 
 pension expense included a benefit of 35.4 million 
for the expected return on assets. 

 Pension expense is sensitive 
to changes in the 
expected return on assets. 
For example, decreasing the expected 
rate of return for 
 2022 from 
5.9 to 
5.65 would 
increase the 
projected 2023 
pension expense 
for the 
Banco Popular 
de Puerto 
Rico Retirement 
 Plan, the Corporation s largest plan, by approximately 
 1.4 million. 

 If 
the 
projected 
benefit 
obligation 
exceeds 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
plan 
assets, 
the 
Corporation 
shall 
recognize 
a 
liability 
equal 
to 
the 
 unfunded projected 
benefit obligation 
and vice 
versa, if 
the fair 
value of 
plan assets 
exceeds the 
projected benefit 
obligation, the 
 Corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected 
benefit obligation. This asset or liability may result 
in a taxable or 
 deductible temporary difference and its 
tax effect shall be 
recognized as an income tax 
expense or benefit which 
shall be allocated 
 to various 
components of 
the financial 
statements, including 
other comprehensive 
income. 
The determination 
of the 
fair value 
of 
 pension 
plan 
obligations 
involves 
judgment, 
and 
any 
changes 
in 
those 
estimates 
could 
impact 
the 
Corporation s 
Consolidated 
 Statements of Financial 
Condition. Management believes that 
the fair value 
estimates of the 
Pension Plans assets 
are reasonable 
 given 
the 
valuation 
methodologies 
used 
to 
measure 
the 
investments 
at 
fair 
value 
as 
described 
in 
Note 
28 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
 Financial 
Statements. 
Also, 
the 
compositions 
of 
the 
plan 
assets 
are 
primarily 
in 
equity 
and 
debt 
securities, 
which 
have 
readily 
 determinable quoted market prices. The Corporation 
had recorded a pension liability of 8.3 
million at December 31, 2022. 

62 
 The Corporation uses 
the spot rate 
yield curve from 
the Willis Towers 
Watson RATE: 
Link (10/90) Model 
to discount the 
expected 
 projected 
cash 
flows 
of 
the 
plans. 
The 
equivalent 
single 
weighted 
average 
discount 
rate 
ranged 
from 
5.34 
to 
5.37 
for 
the 
 Pension Plans and 5.42 for the OPEB Plan to determine 
the benefit obligations at December 31, 2022. 
 A 50 
basis point 
decrease to 
each of 
the rates 
in the 
December 31, 
2022 Willis 
Towers 
Watson RATE: 
Link (10/90) 
Model would 
 increase the 
projected 2023 
expense for 
the Banco 
Popular de 
Puerto Rico 
Retirement Plan 
by approximately 
 1.8 million. 
The 
 change would not affect the minimum required contribution 
to the Pension Plans. 

 The OPEB Plan was unfunded (no assets were held by the plan) at December 31, 2022. The Corporation had recorded a liability for 
 the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of 
 118.3 million at December 31, 2022.

 STATEMENT 
OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS 
 Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the interest earned from loans, debt securities and money market investments, including loan fees, minus 
the 
 interest cost of deposits and borrowed money. 
Various risk factors 
affect net interest income including the economic environment in 
 which we operate, market related events, the mix 
and size of the earning assets and 
related funding, changes in volumes, repricing 
 characteristics, 
loan 
fees 
collected, 
moratoriums granted 
on 
loan 
payments 
and 
delay 
charges, 
interest 
collected 
on 
nonaccrual 
 loans, as well as strategic decisions made by the 
Corporation s management. 
 Net 
interest 
income 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
was 2.2 
billion 
or 
 209.8 
million 
higher than 
in 
2021. 
Net 
interest 
 income, on a taxable equivalent basis, for 
the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2.4 billion 
compared to 2.2 billion in 2021. 
 The average key index rates for the years 2022 and 
2021 were as follows: 

2022 
 2021 
 Prime rate . 
 4.86 
 3.25 
 Fed funds rate . 
 1.86 
 0.25 
 3-month Treasury Bill . 
 2.01 
 0.03 
 10-year Treasury . 
 2.95 
 1.44 
 FNMA 30-year . 
 4.26 
 1.84 
 Average 
outstanding securities 
balances are 
based upon 
amortized cost 
excluding any 
unrealized gains 
or losses 
on securities. 
 Non-accrual 
loans 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
respective 
average 
loans 
and 
leases 
categories. 
Loan 
fees 
collected, 
and 
costs 
 incurred 
in 
the 
origination 
of 
loans 
are 
deferred 
and 
amortized 
over 
the 
term 
of 
the 
loan 
as 
an 
adjustment 
to 
interest 
yield. 
 Prepayment penalties, late fees 
collected and the 
amortization of premiums / 
discounts on purchased loans, 
including the discount 
 accretion on purchased credit 
deteriorated loans PCD ), are 
also included as 
part of the 
loan yield. Interest income 
for the period 
 ended December 31, 
2022, included 44.6 
million related to 
those items, compared 
to 131.5 million 
for the 
same period in 
2021. 
 The year over 
year decrease is 
related to lower 
amortized fees resulting from 
the forgiveness of 
PPP loans by 
 55.7 million, lower 
 discount amortization on commercial loans by 16.3 million mainly driven by lower 
interest from cancellation of PCD loans and 6.6 
 million lower amortization of the fair value discount 
of the auto portfolios acquired in previous 
years.

 ended December 31, 
2022, as compared 
with the same 
period in 2021, 
segregated by major 
categories of interest 
earning assets 
 and 
interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
Net 
interest 
margin 
was 
3.11 
in 
2022 
or 
23 
basis 
points 
higher 
than 
the 
2.88 
reported 
in 
 2021. The 
higher 
net 
interest 
margin 
for 
the 
year 
is 
driven 
by 
 1.6 
billion 
higher 
average 
volume 
of 
earning 
assets 
and 
higher 
 interest rates as 
the Federal Reserve 
increased the Federal 
Funds Rate by 
425 basis points 
during 2022. On 
a taxable equivalent 
 basis, net interest margin 
was 3.46 in 2022, compared to 3.19 
in 2021, an increase 
of 27 basis points. 
The main drivers for the 
 increase in net interest income on a taxable equivalent 
basis were:
 Positive variances:
 
 Higher interest income 
from money market 
investments by 96.9 
million due to 
higher interest rates 
by 111 
basis points, 
 partially offset by lower volume by 6.5 billion, 
as part of the liquidity was deployed to 
purchase investment securities and 
 fund loan growth;
 
 Higher interest income from investment securities by 
 156.1 million due to a higher volume 
by 6.8 million;
 
 Higher interest income from loans by 130.1 
million due to: 
 
 Increase in commercial loan Interest 
income by 71.4 million driven 
by a higher average 
volume of loans by 
 1.1 
billion 
and 
higher 
yield 
by 
7 
basis 
points 
as 
the 
origination 
of 
loans 
occurs 
in 
a 
higher 
interest 
rate 
 scenario and 
the positive 
impact on 
the repricing 
of adjustable-rate 
loans, partially 
offset by 
lower amortized 
 fees 
resulting 
from 
the 
forgiveness 
of 
PPP 
loans 
by 
 55.7 
million 
and 
lower 
discount 
amortization 
on 
 commercial loans by 16.3 million mainly from 
cancellation of PCD loans; 

64 
 
 Higher interest income from 
consumer loans by 44.8 
million resulting from a 
higher volume by 280 
million 
 and higher 
yield by 
49 basis 
points, driven 
by the 
increase in 
personal loans 
year over 
year and 
increase in 
 credit cards volume. 
 Partially offset by:
 
 Higher interest 
expense on 
deposits by 
 141.2 
million 
due to 
the increase 
in interest 
cost 
by 
29 basis 
points 
resulting 
 mainly from a 
higher cost of 
the fully indexed 
Puerto Rico government 
deposits and the 
increase in cost 
of Popular U.S. 
 deposits. 
Under the 
terms 
of 
BPPR s 
deposit pricing 
agreement with 
Puerto 
Rico 
public sector, 
public funds 
rates 
are 
 market linked 
with a 
lag minus 
a specified 
spread. As 
such, if 
short-term interest 
rates continue 
to 
increase, we 
would 
 expect the costs 
of public funds 
to continue to 
increase. This source 
of funding still 
results in an 
attractive spread under 
 market rates.

 Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio 
and Unfunded Commitments 
 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation recorded 
an expense 
of 84.2 
million for 
its allowance 
for credit 
losses 
 ACL related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments, compared with a reserve release of 191.3 million for the year 
 ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
provision 
expense 
related 
to 
the 
loans-held-in-portfolio 
for 
the 
year 
2022 
was 
 83.3 
million, 
 compared 
to 
a 
reserve 
release 
of 
 183.3 
million 
for 
the 
year 
2021. 
The 
reserve 
increase 
is 
mostly 
driven 
by 
changes 
in 
the 
 economic scenario, higher loan 
volumes and changes in 
credit quality. 
The updated economic scenarios 
used to estimate the 
ACL 
 on December 
31, 2022 
considered an 
expected slowdown in 
the economy 
as a 
result of 
tight monetary 
policy, 
weaker job 
growth 
 and persistent inflation. The reserve release recorded in 2021 was driven 
by the release of Covid-related reserves recorded in 2020. 
 The provision for 
unfunded commitments for 
the year 2022 
reflected an expense 
of 0.9 million, 
compared to a 
reserve release of 
 8.0 million for the same period of 2021. 

 The provision expense related 
to loans held-in-portfolio for 
the BPPR segment was 
 69.5 million for the 
year ended December 31, 
 2022, compared to 
a reserve release 
of 129.0 million 
for the 
year ended December 
31, 2021, an 
unfavorable variance of 
 198.6 
 million. The provision expense related to loans held-in-portfolio for 
the Popular U.S. segment was 13.8 million for the year 2022, an 
 unfavorable variance of 68.1 million, compared to 
a reserve release of 54.3 million for 
the year 2021. 
 At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
total 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
loans 
held-in-portfolio amounted 
to 
 720.3 
million, 
compared 
to 
 695.4 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
ratio 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
to 
loans 
held-in-portfolio 
was 
2.25 
at 
 December 
31, 
2022, compared 
to 
2.38 
at 
December 31, 
2021. Refer 
to 
Note 
9 
to 
the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements, for 
 additional information on the Corporation s methodology to estimate its ACL. As discussed therein, within the process to estimate its 
 ACL, the Corporation applies probability weights to the 
outcomes of simulations using Moody s Analytics Baseline, S3 (pessimistic) 
 and 
S1 
(optimistic) scenarios. 
The baseline 
scenario is 
assigned the 
highest probability, 
followed 
by the 
pessimistic scenario. 
In 
 addition, 
refer 
to 
the 
Credit 
Risk 
section 
of 
this 
MD A 
for 
a 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
net 
charge-offs, 
non-performing 
assets, 
the 
 allowance for credit losses and selected loan 
losses statistics. 
 Provision for Credit Losses Investment Securities 
 The 
Corporation s 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
related 
to 
its 
investment 
securities 
held-to-maturity 
is 
related 
to 
the 
portfolio 
of 
 obligations 
from 
the 
Government 
of 
Puerto 
Rico, 
states 
and 
political 
subdivisions. 
For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
 Corporation recorded a reserve release of 
 1.2 million, compared to a reserve 
release of 2.2 million for the 
year ended December 
 31, 2021. At 
December 31, 2022, 
the total allowance 
for credit losses 
for this portfolio 
amounted to 6.9 
million, compared to 
 8.1 
 million as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ACL for 
 this portfolio. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 For the 
year ended December 
31, 2022, non-interest 
income increased by 
 254.9 million, when 
compared with the 
previous year. 
 The results for the year 2022 included a 257.7 million gain related to the Evertec 
Transactions and related accounting adjustments. 
 Other factors that contributed to the variance in non-interest 
income were: 

higher other service fees by 22.8 million, principally at the BPPR segment, due to higher credit card fees by 18.9 million 
 mainly in interchange income resulting from higher customer purchase activity and higher fees from the merchant network 
 business by 6.7 million due to the revenue sharing 
agreement entered into in connection with 
the Evertec Transactions; 

a 
favorable 
adjustment 
of 
 9.2 
million 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
contingent 
consideration 
related 
to 
purchase 
price 
 adjustments 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
K2 
Capital 
Group 
LLC 
business 
in 
2021 K2 
Acquisition ), 
as 
the 
Corporation 
 updated its estimates related to the ability to realize 
the earnings targets for the contingent payment; and 

a gain of 8.2 million from the sale of an 
investment which had been previously written off; 
 partially offset by: 

67 

lower service charges on deposit accounts by 5.5 million, mainly at BPPR, due to lower overdraft related charges, in part 
 due to the 
Corporation s determination of 
eliminating insufficient funds 
fees and modifying 
overdraft fees effective 
on the 
 third quarter of 2022 and lower cash management service charges from commercial clients due to higher earnings credits 
 on transactional accounts driven by the current interest 
rate environment; 

lower 
income 
from 
mortgage 
banking 
activities 
by 
7.7 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
lower 
gains 
from 
loan 
securitization 
and 
 valuation adjustments 
on loans 
held for 
sale 
by 
 21.9 million, 
impacted by 
the 
Corporation s determination 
in the 
third 
 quarter of 2022 to 
retain certain guaranteed loans as 
held for investment; partially offset 
by a favorable variance of 
 10.4 
 million in the 
fair value adjustments for 
mortgage servicing rights driven 
by slower projected prepayments 
in the serviced 
 portfolio and higher gains from closed derivative 
positions by 5.3 million; 

an unfavorable variance of 7.5 million on the fair value adjustments to the portfolio of equity securities related to deferred 
 benefit plans, which have an offsetting effect recorded as 
lower personnel costs; and 

the gain of 7.0 million recognized in the third 
quarter of 2021 by BPPR as a result of 
the sale and partial leaseback of two 
 corporate office buildings. 
 Operating Expenses 
 As discussed 
in the 
significant events 
section of 
this MD A, 
to facilitate 
the transparency 
of the 
progress with 
the transformation 
 initiative and 
to better 
portray the 
level of 
technology related 
expenses categorized 
by the 
nature of 
the expense, 
effective in 
the 
 fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
separated 
technology, 
professional 
fees 
and 
transactional 
activities

 Operating expenses 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 increased 
by 197.1 
million, when 
compared with 
the previous 
year. 
 The increase in operating expenses was driven 
primarily by: 

Higher 
personnel 
costs 
by 
 88.0 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
salaries 
expense 
by 
 61.3 
million 
as 
a 
result 
of 
market 
 adjustments, 
annual salary 
revisions and 
an increase 
in headcount, 
higher commission 
and incentives 
by 13.7 
million, 
 due to higher headcount, salary revisions and, in part, profit-sharing expense and higher payroll taxes and fringe benefits, 
 including health and retirement benefits, reflecting 
the overall increase in salary base; 

Higher net occupancy expense by 3.9 million mainly due to BPPR s lower rental income 
due to the sale of two corporate 
 office buildings during the third quarter of 2021,
 coupled with higher rent expense related to the space remaining occupied 
 by BPPR; 

69 

Higher other taxes by 
 6.8 million mainly due to 
an increase in personal property 
tax expense and a higher 
base used to 
 estimate an annual Puerto Rico regulatory license 
fee; 

Higher professional fees by 45.3 million primarily due 
to Corporate initiatives including 22 million related to 
a multi-year 
 corporate transformation 
initiative to 
expand the 
Corporation s digital 
capabilities, modernize 
its technology 
platform and 
 implement agile and efficient business processes; 

Higher technology and software 
expenses by 13.9 
million mainly due 
to higher software 
amortization expense by 10.3 
 million, including 
 2.4 million 
related to 
the software 
intangible assets acquired 
as part 
of the 
Evertec Transactions, 
and 
 higher 
IT 
professional 
fees 
and 
network 
management 
expense 
by 
 15.5 
million 
due 
to 
various 
ongoing 
technology 
 projects; partially offset 
by a decrease in 
charges related to internet 
banking of 9.6 million 
and lower application hosting 
 expense reflecting savings as a result of the Evertec 
Transactions; 

Higher 
processing 
and 
transactional 
services 
by 
 5.8 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
credit 
and 
debit 
card 
processing 
 expense as 
a result 
of higher transactional 
volumes, reflecting 
an increase in 
customer purchase activity; 
partially offset 
 by lower merchant processing 
due to higher incentives received 
during the year related to 
the ATH 
Network Participation 
 Agreement entered into in connection with the 
Evertec Transactions; 

Higher business promotion expense by 15.9 million mainly due to higher customer reward program expense in our credit 
 card business by 12.9 
million, reflecting an increase 
in customer purchase activity, 
higher sponsorship expense by 1.5 
 million and higher donations by 1.2 
million, including hurricane related donations; 

Higher 
total 
other 
operating 
expenses, 
including 
operational 
losses, 
by 
 17.3 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
 17.3 
million 
 expense related to the Evertec Transactions; 
net of 6.9 million in credits received in 
connection with this transaction and
 higher gain on sale of foreclosed auto units by 
 6.6 million; offset by 6.5 million of lower sundry 
losses; 
and 

a goodwill impairment charge of 9.0 million due 
to a decrease in Popular Equipment Finance s (PEF) projected earnings 
 considered as part of the Corporation s annual goodwill 
impairment analysis. 
 These variances were partially offset by: 

Higher 
other 
real 
estate 
owned 
(OREO) 
income 
by 
 7.7 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
gain 
on 
sale 
of 
commercial 
 properties; 
and 

Lower amortization 
of intangibles 
by 5.9 
million due 
to an 
impairment write-down 
of 5.4 
million of 
a trademark 
during 
 2021. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation recorded an 
income tax 
expense of 
 132.3 million, 
compared to 
 309.0 
 million for 
the same 
period of 
2021. 
The income 
tax expense 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, reflects 
the impact 
of the 
 reversal of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of the U. S. Operations amounting to 68.2 million, higher taxable 
 income 
subject 
to 
preferential tax 
rates, 
primarily attributed 
to 
the 
gain 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
Evertec shares, 
and 
higher tax 
exempt 
 income recorded during this year. 
 At December 
31, 2022, 
the Corporation 
had a 
net deferred 
tax asset 
amounting to 
 1 billion, 
net of 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 0.5 
 billion. The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. 
operations was 0.3 billion, net of a valuation 
allowance of 0.4 billion. 
 The Inflation 
Reduction Act 
of 2022 imposes 
a new 
corporate alternative minimum 
tax AMT ), 
effective for 
taxable year 
2023, to 
 corporations that meet a dual three-year average adjusted financial statement income AFSI 
threshold of 1 billion on a worldwide 
 basis and 100 
million for its 
U.S. operations. 
The AFSI is, 
in general, the 
GAAP net income 
per financial statements 
with certain 
 adjustments, including 
foreign taxes 
and tax 
depreciation. 
The Corporation 
is still 
evaluating the 
application of 
these adjustments 
 that could be 
decisive in whether Popular 
is subject to 
the corporate AMT. 
If it is 
determined that the Corporation 
is subject to 
the 
 corporate AMT, it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Corporation. 
 Refer to 
Note 35 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
a reconciliation 
of the 
statutory income 
tax rate 
to the 
effective tax 
 rate and additional information on the income 
tax expense and deferred tax asset balances.

 Fourth Quarter Results 
 The Corporation recognized net income of 257.1 million for the 
quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared with a net income 
of 
 206.1 million for the same quarter of 2021. 
 Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 
2022 amounted to 559.6 million, compared with 501.3 million for the 
fourth quarter of 
 2021, an increase of 58.3 million. 
The increase in net interest income was mainly due higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve 
 increased the Federal 
Funds Rate by 
425 basis points 
during 2022 and 
higher average balance 
of loans resulting 
from the growth 
 during 2022 
at both 
BPPR and 
PB. The 
net interest 
margin increased 
by 50 
basis points 
to 3.28 
due to 
an increase 
in market 
 rates 
and 
the 
earning 
assets 
mix, 
that 
had 
a 
higher 
concentration on 
loans 
which 
carry 
a 
higher 
yield 
than 
money 
market 
and 
 investment securities. On a taxable equivalent 
basis, the net interest margin for the 
fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.64 , compared 
to 
 3.02 for the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 The provision 
for credit 
losses was 
a 49.5 
million for 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2022, compared 
to a 
reserve release 
benefit of 
 33.1 
 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The provision expense 
recorded in the fourth quarter or 2022 reflects 
changes in credit metrics, 
 portfolio growth 
as well 
as changes 
in the 
macroeconomic outlook 
and considers 
an 
expected slowdown 
in the 
economy during 
 2023, as 
a result 
of weaker 
job growth, 
monetary policy 
and the 
persistent inflation. 
The benefit 
recorded in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
 2021 
was 
reflective 
of 
improvements 
in 
the 
credit 
metrics 
and 
the 
macroeconomic 
outlook 
as 
well 
as 
releases 
in 
qualitative 
 reserves. 

 Non-interest income 
amounted to 
 158.5 million 
for the 
quarter ended 
December 31, 
2022, compared 
with 164.7 
million for 
the 
 same quarter in 2021. The 
decrease of 6.2 million was mainly 
due lower income from mortgage banking activities by 
 10.5 million 
 due to 
an unfavorable 
variance of 
 4.1 million 
in the 
fair value 
adjustments of 
mortgage servicing 
rights and 
lower gains 
from the 
 sale and securitization of 
mortgage loans as the 
Corporation made the determination to 
retain certain guaranteed loans 
as held for 

 investment. In addition, 
service charges on 
deposit accounts were 
lower by 6.9 
million, due to 
lower overdraft related 
charges, in 
 part due 
to the 
Corporation s determination of 
eliminating insufficient funds 
fees and 
modifying overdraft fees 
effective on 
the third 
 quarter 
of 
2022 
and 
lower 
cash 
management 
service 
charges 
from 
commercial 
clients 
due 
to 
higher 
earnings 
credits 
on 
 transactional accounts. 
 Operating expenses 
totaled 461.7 
million for 
the quarter 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
compared with 
 417.4 million 
for the 
same 
 quarter in 
the previous 
year. 
The increase 
of 44.3 
million is 
mainly related 
to higher 
personnel costs 
by 29.7 
million, due 
to 
a 
 higher 
headcount 
and 
market 
and 
annual 
salary 
revisions 
as 
well 
as 
higher 
incentives 
and 
commissions; 
higher 
professional 
 services expense 
by 16.6 
million due 
to various 
corporate projects, 
including the 
transformation initiative; 
higher technology 
and 
 software expenses by 7.3 
million due to various 
ongoing technology projects and 
software amortization, including from the 
assets 
 acquired from Evertec; partially offset by higher benefit from OREO related activity by 5.3 million due to gains on sale of foreclosed 
 properties; lower operational losses by 7.8 million and lower 
amortization of intangibles by 5.3 million due to an 
impairment write-
 down of 5.4 million of a trademark during 2021. 
 For the quarter ended December 
31, 2022, the Corporation recorded 
an income tax benefit of 
 50.3 million, compared with income 
 tax expense of 75.6 million for 
the same quarter of 2021. The 
favorable variance in income tax expense was mainly 
attributable to 
 a 
partial 
reversal 
of 
the 
deferred tax 
asset valuation 
allowance 
of 
the 
U.S. 
operation during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022 
of 
 68.2 
 million and lower 
income before tax, 
higher benefit from 
tax-exempt income, including true-up 
adjustment of 9.5 million 
in relation 
 to the 
fiscal year 
2021 tax 
returns for 
the P.R. 
subsidiaries filed 
in the 
fourth quarter 
and related 
year-to-date adjustments 
for the 
 same concept. 

 REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 
 The Corporation s 
reportable segments 
for managerial 
reporting purposes 
consist of 
Banco Popular 
de Puerto 
Rico and 
Popular 
 U.S. A Corporate group has been defined to 
support the reportable segments. 

 For 
a 
description 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
reportable 
segments, 
including 
additional 
financial 
information 
and 
the 
underlying 
 management accounting process, refer to Note 37 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

71 
 The Corporate group reported a net income of 150.1 
million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
compared with a net income of 
 13.4 
million 
for 
the 
previous 
year. 
The 
increase 
in 
net 
income 
was 
mainly 
attributed 
to 
the 
 128.8 
million 
in 
after-tax 
gains 
 recognized by the Corporation as 
a result of the 
Evertec Stock Sale and related 
accounting adjustments; lower interest expense by 
 10.4 million 
from the 
redemption in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2021 of 
 186.7 million 
in Trust 
Preferred Securities 
issued by 
Popular 
 Capital Trust I; and higher earnings from equity method investments. 
 Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable 
segments are discussed below: 
 Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

 The Banco Popular 
de Puerto Rico reportable 
segment s net income 
amounted to 782.0 
million for the 
year ended December 31, 
 2022, compared with 787.5 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2021. 
The principal factors that contributed to the 
variance in 
 the financial results included the following: 

Higher 
net 
interest 
income 
by 
 148.9 
million 
due 
to 
higher 
income 
from 
money 
market 
and 
investment 
securities 
by 
 218.3 
million mainly 
due to 
higher yields 
driven by 
the increase 
in rates 
by the 
Federal Reserve 
and 
higher 
average 
 balances of 
U.S. Treasury 
securities; 
higher interest 
income from 
loans by 
 54.7 million, 
mainly due 
to higher 
average 
 balances from consumer, leasing and 
commercial loans; partially offset by 
higher interest expense on deposits by 123.7 
 million 
mainly 
due to 
higher costs 
on the 
market- indexed 
Puerto Rico 
government deposits, 
NOW accounts 
and time 
 deposits. 
The 
BPPR 
segment s 
net 
interest margin 
was 
3.05 
for 
2022 
compared 
with 
2.86 for 
the 
same 
period in 
 2021. 

A provision for loan losses expenses of 70.3 million in 2022, compared to a reserve release of 136.4 million for the year 
 ended 2021, 
or 
an unfavorable 
variance of 
 206.7 million. 
The provision 
for loan 
losses for 
2022 
reflects an 
expected 
 slowdown in the economy in 
2023. During 2021, BPPR recorded a 
reserve for credit losses release of 
 136.4 million due 
 to improved credit metrics and Covid-related macroeconomic 
outlook and 
changes in qualitative reserves; 

Higher non-interest income by 115.0 million mainly due to: 

Higher other operating income by 112.0 million mostly due to the benefit related to the Evertec Business Acquisition 
 Transaction, 

Higher 
other 
service 
fees 
by 
 21.3 
million 
due 
to 
higher 
merchant 
acquiring 
fees 
related 
to 
the 
revenue 
sharing 
 agreement 
entered 
in 
connection with 
the 
Evertec 
Transactions 
and 
higher 
credit 
card 
fees 
as 
a 
result 
of 
higher 
 interchange transaction volumes. 

Higher operating expenses by 167.8 million, mainly 
due to: 

Higher other 
expenses by 75.5 
million mainly due 
to higher allocations 
from the 
Corporate group by 
 56.0 million, 
 mainly advisory and other professional services, and 
a 17.3 million expense related to Evertec Transactions; 

Higher personnel costs by 71.8 million driven 
by higher salaries and benefits due to market 
salary adjustments and 
 annual salary revisions 
and a higher 
headcount; higher incentive compensation, 
higher profit sharing expenses 
and 
 higher fringe benefits; 

Higher 
business 
promotions 
by 
 15.6 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
customer 
rewards 
expense 
related 
to 
higher 
 transactional volumes and higher sponsorships and donations, 
including hurricane related assistance; 

Higher 
technology and 
software expenses 
by 
 5.7 
million 
including 2.4 
million 
related 
to 
the software 
intangible 
 assets acquired as part of the Evertec Transactions, and costs 
associated with several ongoing projects; 

Higher processing 
and transactional 
services by 
 5.8 million 
mainly due 
to higher 
credit and 
debit card 
processing 
 expense as 
a result 
of higher 
transactional volumes, 
reflecting an 
increase in 
customer purchase 
activity; 
partially 
 offset by 
lower merchant 
processing due 
to higher 
incentives received 
during the 
year related 
to the 
ATH 
Network 
 Participation Agreement entered into in connection with 
the Evertec Transactions; 

72 
 Partially offset by: 

Higher OREO income by 7.4 million mainly due 
to higher gain on sale of OREO of 5.9 
million. 

Lower professional fees by 3.8 million mainly due 
to lower consulting fees related to ongoing projects. 

Lower 
income 
tax 
expense 
by 
 105.1 
million 
due 
to 
lower 
income 
before 
tax 
and 
higher 
income 
that 
was 
exempt 
or 
 subject to preferential tax rates. 
 Popular U.S. 

 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 2022, the 
reportable segment of 
Popular U.S. 
reported net income 
of 170.3 
million, compared 
 with a net 
income of 134.1 million for 
the year ended December 
31, 2021. The principal 
factors that contributed to 
the variance in 
 the financial results included the following: 

Higher net interest income by 51.8 million mainly due to higher interest income from loans by 74.2 million mainly due to 
 higher 
average 
balances from 
commercial 
loans as 
well 
as 
higher yields 
due 
to 
increase 
in 
rates; and 
higher 
interest 
 income from money market investment securities by 2.9 million due to 
higher rates, 
partially offset by lower income from 
 debt securities by 
 1.6 million and higher 
cost of deposits 
by 22.9 million due 
to higher interest rates. 
The Popular U.S. 
 reportable segment s net interest margin was 3.68 
for 2022 compared with 3.39 for the same period 
in 2021; 

An unfavorable variance of 
 69.3 million on the 
provision for loan losses 
and unfunded commitments, due to 
the reserve 
 release 
of 
 56.9 
million 
in 
2021, 
which 
reflected 
improvements 
in 
credit 
metrics 
and 
Covid-related 
economic 
outlook, 

 compared to 
a provision 
expense of 
 12.5 million 
recorded in 
2022 which 
reflected an 
expected economic 
slowdown in 
 2023; 

Higher non-interest income by 
 7.4 million mainly due 
to the positive adjustment 
of 9.2 million on 
the contingent liability 
 related to the K-2 Acquisition; 

Higher operating expenses by 35.4 million mainly due 
to: 

Higher personnel costs by 10.2 million due to 
salary market and annual adjustments; 

Higher 
other 
expenses 
by 
 7.4 
million 
due 
to 
higher 
charges 
allocated from 
the 
Corporate segment, 
mainly 
 professional fees; and 

The goodwill impairment charge of 9.0 million recorded 
at PEF. 

Lower 
income 
tax 
expense 
by 
 81.7 
million 
due 
mainly 
to 
a 
lower 
income 
before 
tax 
and 
the 
partial 
reversal 
of 
the 
 deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded during 
the fourth quarter of 2022 of 68.2 million. 

 STATEMENT 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 

 Assets 
 The Corporation s total 
assets were 67.6 billion 
at December 31, 2022, 
compared to 75.1 billion 
at December 31, 2021. 
Refer to 
 the Corporation s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and 2021 included in this 2022 Form 10-K. 
 Also, refer to the Statistical Summary 2022-2021 
in this MD A for Condensed Statements of Financial 
Condition. 

 Money market investments and debt securities 
 Money market 
investments decreased 
by 11 
.9 billion 
at December 
31, 2022, 
when compared 
to December 
31, 2021. 
This was 
 impacted 
by 
the 
decrease 
in 
deposits of 
 5.8 
billion, 
mainly 
in the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Public 
sector, 
and 
the deployment 
of 
liquidity to 
 purchase 
debt 
securities. 
Debt 
securities 
available-for-sale 
decreased 
by 
 7.2 
billion, 
while 
debt 
securities 
held-to-maturity 
 increased by 8.4 billion. As previously mentioned, during 
2022 the Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury securities with 
a fair value 

73 
 of 6.5 billion (par 
value of 7.4 billion) 
from its available-for-sale portfolio to 
its held-to-maturity portfolio. Refer to 
Notes 6 and 7 
to 
 the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional 
information with respect 
to the 
Corporation s debt securities 
available-for-sale 
 and held-to-maturity. 
 Loans 
 Refer to Table 
6 for a breakdown of 
the Corporation s loan portfolio. Also, 
refer to Note 8 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for detailed information about the Corporation s loan portfolio 
composition and loan purchases and sales. 
 Loans 
held-in-portfolio increased 
by 
 2.8 
billion to 
 32.1 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
mainly 
due 
to 
growth in 
the 
commercial 
 portfolio 
of 
 2.0 
billion, 
reflected 
at 
both 
BPPR 
and 
PB 
by 
approximately 1.0 
billion, 
at 
each 
segment 
and 
consumer 
loans 
at 
 BPPR. 
The 
commercial 
loans 
growth 
includes 
U.S. 
region 
loans 
participated 
between 
BPPR 
and 
PB. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 
31, 
2022, BPPR 
participated in 
loans 
originated by 
PB 
totaling 
 184 
million. 
Consumer loans 
at 
BPPR 
increased 
by 
 532.4 million in the aggregate including credit 
cards, personal loans and auto loans. 
The increase in BPPR s consumer portfolio is 
 aligned with the increase in 
retail sales and consumer spending in 
Puerto Rico during 2022 and 
the purchase of national consumer 
 loans through 
its U.S. 
branch. The 
auto loans 
portfolio at 
BPPR benefited 
from the 
sustained level 
of auto 
sales, which 
although 
 lower than 2021, remained a higher than 2020. In addition, though mortgage loans declined by 29.7 million from the previous year, 
 this was 
impacted by 
management s determination 
to retain 
certain guaranteed 
loans in 
the portfolio, 
which reduced 
the portfolio 
 attrition. 

 The 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
increased 
by 
 24.9 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
 outlook, credit quality metrics and portfolio 
growth. Refer to the Credit 
Quality section of the MD A 
for additional information on the 
 Allowance for credit losses for the loan portfolio.

 Deposits 
 The 
Corporation s 
deposits 
totaled 
 61.2 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 
 67.0 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2021.The 
 deposits decrease 
of 5.8 
billion was mainly 
due to 
lower Puerto Rico 
public sector 
deposits by 
 5.2 billion. 
Public sector 
deposit 
 balances 
amounted 
to 
 15.2 
billion 
at 
December 
31, 
2022. 
The 
receipt 
by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Government 
of 
additional 
Federal 

75 
 assistance, and 
seasonal tax 
collections, could 
increase public 
deposit balances 
at BPPR 
in the 
near term. 
However, 
the rate 
at 
 which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The 
amount and timing of any such reduction is likely 
 to 
be 
impacted 
by, 
for 
example, 
the 
speed 
at 
which 
federal 
assistance 
is 
distributed, 
the 
financial 
condition, 
liquidity 
and 
cash 
 management 
practices 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Government 
and 
its 
instrumentalities 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
fiscal 
and 
debt 
 adjustment plans approved 
pursuant to PROMESA 
or other actions 
mandated by the 
Fiscal Oversight and 
Management Board for 
 Puerto Rico (the Oversight Board ). 
 Approximately 25 of the 
Corporation s deposits are public 
fund deposits from the 
Government of Puerto Rico, 
municipalities and 
 government instrumentalities and corporations public funds ). 
These public funds deposits are 
indexed to short term market 
rates 
 and fluctuate 
in cost 
with changes 
in those 
rates with 
a one-quarter 
lag, in 
accordance with 
contractual terms. 
As a 
result, these 
 public 
funds 
deposits 
costs 
have 
generally 
lagged 
variable 
asset 
repricing. 
During 
2022, 
the 
deposit 
costs 
for 
public 
funds 
 increased by 61 when compared 
to 2021. 
We expect these costs 
to continue to increase if 
short-term rates continue their recent 
 trend. 
For example, we 
expect an increase 
in costs on 
these public funds 
by approximately 120 
basis points in 
the first quarter 
of 
 2023 when compared to the last quarter in 2022.

 The decrease 
was principally due 
to higher

and 
 the impact of 
 631.0 million from the 
two accelerated share repurchase

 REGULATORY CAPITAL 
 The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy 
standards established by the Federal Reserve Board. The 
 risk-based capital standards 
applicable to Popular, 
Inc. and the 
Banks, BPPR 
and PB, are 
based on the 
final capital framework 
of 
 Basel III. The 
capital rules of 
Basel III include 
a Common Equity Tier 
1 CET1 capital 
measure and specifies 
that Tier 
1 capital 
 consist of 
CET1 and Additional 
Tier 1 
Capital instruments meeting 
specified requirements. Note 
21 to the 
Consolidated Financial 
 Statements presents further 
information on the 
Corporation s regulatory capital requirements, 
including the regulatory capital 
ratios 
 of its depository institutions, BPPR and PB. 
 An institution 
is considered well-capitalized 
if it 
maintains a total 
capital ratio 
of 10 , 
a Tier 
1 capital ratio 
of 8 , 
a CET1 capital 
 ratio 
of 
6.5 
and 
a 
leverage 
ratio 
of 
5 . 
The 
Corporation s 
ratios 
presented 
in 
Table
 9 
show 
that 
the 
Corporation 
was 
 well 
 capitalized for 
regulatory purposes, 
the highest 
classification, under 
Basel III 
for years 
2022 and 
2021. BPPR 
and PB 
were also 
 well-capitalized for all years presented. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules also require an additional 2.5 capital conservation buffer , composed entirely of CET1, on top of these 
 minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, which excludes the leverage ratio. The capital conservation buffer is 
designed to absorb losses 
 during periods of 
economic stress. Banking 
institutions with a 
ratio of CET1 
to risk-weighted assets 
above the minimum 
but below 
 the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation 
based on the amount of the 
 shortfall. Popular, 
BPPR and 
PB are 
required to 
maintain this 
additional capital 
conservation buffer 
of 2.5 
of CET1, 
resulting in 
 minimum ratios 
of (i) CET1 
to risk-weighted 
assets of 
at least 
7 , (ii) Tier 
1 capital 
to risk-weighted 
assets of 
at least 
8.5 , and 
 (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 .

information for the years 2022 and 2021.

 On April 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the final rule issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies pursuant to the Economic 
 Growth and 
Regulatory Paperwork 
Reduction Act 
of 1996 
that simplified 
several requirements 
in the 
agencies regulatory 
capital 
 rules. These 
rules simplified 
the regulatory 
capital requirement 
for mortgage 
servicing assets 
(MSAs), deferred 
tax assets 
arising 
 from 
temporary 
differences 
and 
investments in 
the 
capital 
of 
unconsolidated financial 
institutions 
by 
raising 
the 
CET1 
deduction 
 threshold 
from 
10 
to 
25 . 
The 
15 
CET1 
deduction 
threshold 
which 
applies 
to 
the 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
such 
items 
was 
 eliminated. The 
rule also 
requires, among 
other changes, 
increasing from 
100 to 
250 the 
risk weight 
to MSAs 
and temporary 

77 
 difference deferred 
tax asset 
not deducted 
from capital. 
For investments 
in the 
capital of 
unconsolidated financial 
institutions, the 
 risk weight would be based on the exposure category 
of the investment. 

 The decrease in the CET1 capital ratio, 
Tier 1 capital ratio 
and, total capital ratio as of 
December 31, 2022, compared to December 
 31, 
2021,
 was 
mostly 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
risk 
weighted 
assets 
driven 
by 
the 
growth 
in 
the 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
loan 
 portfolios, partially offset by the annual earnings net of the accelerated share 
repurchase agreements to repurchase an aggregate of 
 400 million and 
 231 million of Popular s common 
stock. The increase in 
leverage capital ratio was 
mainly due to the 
decrease in 
 average total assets, driven by the reduction 
in zero-risk weighted investments in money market FED accounts 
and zero or low-risk 
 weighted debt securities, that therefore did not have 
a significant impact on the risk-weighted assets. 
 Pursuant 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
CECL 
on 
January 
1, 
2020, 
the 
Corporation elected 
to 
use 
the 
five-year 
transition 
period 
option 
as 
 provided in the final 
interim regulatory 
capital rules effective March 31,2020. 
The five-year transition period provision 
delays for two 
 years the 
estimated impact 
of 
CECL on 
regulatory capital, 
followed by 
a three-year 
transition period 
to 
phase out 
the aggregate 
 amount of 
the capital benefits 
provided during the 
initial two-year delay. 
As of 
December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation had 
phased-in 
 25 of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be 
recognized over the remaining two years. In the first quarter of 
 2023, the Corporation will phase in a cumulative 
50 of the deferral. 
 On 
August 
26, 
2020, 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
issued 
a 
final 
rule 
to 
modify 
the 
Basel 
III 
regulatory 
capital 
rules 
applicable 
to 
 banking organizations to allow 
those organizations participating in 
the Paycheck Protection Program PPP established under the 
 Coronavirus Aid, Relief 
and Economic Security 
Act (the 
 CARES Act to 
neutralize the regulatory 
capital effects 
of participating in 
 the 
program. 
Specifically, 
the 
agencies 
have 
clarified 
that 
banking 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Corporation 
and 
its 
Bank 
 subsidiaries, are permitted to 
assign a zero 
percent risk weight to 
PPP loans for 
purposes of determining risk-weighted 
assets and 
 risk-based 
capital 
ratios. 
Additionally, 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
use 
of 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
Liquidity 
Facility 
(the 
 PPPL 
 Facility ), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation s Bank subsidiaries to 
 fund PPP loans, the 
agencies further clarified that, 
for purposes of determining 
leverage ratios, a banking 
organization is permitted 
 to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a 
PPPL Facility. As of December 31, 
2022, 
 the Corporation has 38 million in PPP loans and no 
loans were pledged as collateral for PPPL 
Facilities.

 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 The tangible 
common equity 
ratio and 
tangible book 
value per 
common share, 
which are 
presented in 
the table 
that follows, 
are 
 non-GAAP measures. 
Management and 
many stock 
analysts use 
the tangible 
common equity 
ratio and 
tangible book 
value per 
 common share in conjunction with more traditional bank 
capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking 
organizations with 
 significant amounts 
of goodwill 
or other 
intangible assets, 
typically stemming 
from the 
use of 
the purchase 
accounting method 
of 
 accounting 
for 
mergers 
and 
acquisitions. 
Neither 
tangible 
common 
equity 
nor 
tangible 
assets 
or 
related 
measures 
should 
be 
 considered in 
isolation or 
as a 
substitute for stockholders 
equity, 
total assets 
or any 
other measure calculated 
in accordance with 
 generally accepted accounting principles in the United 
States of America GAAP ). Moreover, 
the manner in which the 
Corporation 
 calculates 
its 
tangible 
common 
equity, 
tangible 
assets 
and 
any 
other related 
measures may 
differ 
from 
that 
of 
other 
companies 
 reporting measures with similar names. 

78 
 The decrease 
in the 
Tangible 
common 
equity to 
tangible assets 
ratio during 
2022 was 
mainly related 
to the 
decrease in 
the fair 
 value of 
the Corporation s 
fixed rate 
available for sale 
debt securities 
portfolio and 
its impact 
on the 
unrealized loss component 
of 
 accumulated 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
(loss) AOCI ). 
Given 
its 
ability 
due 
to 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
and 
its 
 intention to reduce the 
impact on AOCI and tangible 
capital of further increases in 
interest rates, management changed its intent 
to 
 hold certain securities to maturity. 
Therefore, in October 2022, the Corporation transferred U.S. 
Treasury securities with a fair 
value 
 of 6.5 billion (par value of 7.4 billion) from 
its available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. 

 The 
securities 
were reclassified 
at 
fair value 
at the 
time 
of 
the transfer. 
At 
the 
date of 
the transfer, 
these 
securities 
had 
pre-tax 
 unrealized 
losses 
of 
 873.0 
million 
recorded 
in 
AOCI. 
This 
fair 
value 
discount 
is 
being 
accreted 
to 
interest 
income 
and 
the 
 unrealized loss remaining in 
AOCI is being amortized, 
offsetting each other through 
the remaining life of 
the securities. There were 
 no realized gains or losses recorded as a result 
of this transfer. 

 While changes 
in the 
amount of 
unrealized gains 
and losses 
in AOCI 
have an 
impact on 
the Corporation s 
and its 
wholly-owned 
 banking 
subsidiaries 
tangible 
capital 
ratios, 
they 
do 
not 
impact 
regulatory 
capital 
ratios, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
regulatory 
 framework.

 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Market / Interest Rate Risk 
 The financial results and capital levels of the 
Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest 
rate and liquidity risks. 
 Market risk 
refers to the 
risk of a 
reduction in the 
Corporation s capital due 
to changes in 
the market valuation 
of its assets 
and/or 
 liabilities. 

 Most of the assets 
subject to market valuation risk 
are debt securities classified as 
available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 
and 7 to the 
 Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
further information 
on the 
debt 
securities available-for-sale 
and 
held-to-maturity portfolios. 
 Debt securities classified 
as available-for-sale amounted 
to 17.8 billion 
as of December 
31, 2022. Other 
assets subject to 
market 
 risk include loans 
held-for-sale, which amounted 
to 5 
million, mortgage servicing 
rights MSRs which 
amounted to 128 
million 
 and securities classified as trading , which amounted 
to 28 million, as of December 31, 2022. 

 Interest Rate Risk IRR 
 The Corporation s net interest income is subject 
to various categories of interest rate 
risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and 
 option risks. 
In managing 
interest rate 
risk, management may 
alter the 
mix of 
floating and 
fixed rate 
assets and 
liabilities, change 
 pricing 
schedules, 
adjust 
maturities 
through 
sales 
and 
purchases 
of 
investment 
securities, 
and 
enter 
into 
derivative 
contracts, 
 among other alternatives. 

 Interest 
rate 
risk 
management 
is 
an 
active 
process 
that 
encompasses 
monitoring 
loan 
and 
deposit 
flows 
complemented 
by 
 investment and funding 
activities. Effective management of 
interest rate risk begins 
with understanding the dynamic 
characteristics 
 of assets and 
liabilities and determining the 
appropriate rate risk position 
given line of 
business forecasts, management objectives, 
 market expectations and policy constraints. 
 Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest 
Income NII simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 
 Economic Value 
of Equity EVE ). The 
three methodologies 
complement each 
other and 
are used 
jointly in 
the evaluation 
of the 
 Corporation s IRR. NII 
simulation modeling is 
prepared for a 
five-year period, which 
in conjunction with 
the EVE analysis, 
provides 
 management a better view of long-term IRR. 
 Net interest 
income simulation analysis 
performed by legal 
entity and on 
a consolidated basis 
is a 
tool used 
by the 
Corporation in 
 estimating the 
potential change 
in net 
interest income 
resulting from 
hypothetical changes 
in interest 
rates. Sensitivity 
analysis is 
 calculated using a simulation model which incorporates 
actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity 
and interest yields or costs. 

 Management assesses 
interest rate 
risk by 
comparing various 
NII simulations 
under different 
interest rate 
scenarios that 
differ in 
 direction of interest 
rate changes, the 
degree of change 
and the projected 
shape of the 
yield curve. For 
example, the types 
of rate 
 scenarios processed during the 
quarter include flat rates, 
implied forwards, and parallel 
and non-parallel rate shocks. 
Management 
 also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis 
and prepayment risk exposures. 

 The asset 
and liability 
management group 
performs validation 
procedures on 
various assumptions 
used as 
part of 
the simulation 
 analyses as well as validations 
of results on a 
monthly basis. In addition, the 
model and processes used to 
assess IRR are subject 
 to independent validations according to the guidelines 
established in the Model Governance and Validation policy. 
 The Corporation processes NII 
simulations under interest rate 
scenarios in which the 
yield curve is assumed 
to rise and 
decline by 
 the same 
magnitude (parallel 
shifts). The 
rate scenarios 
considered in 
these market 
risk simulations 
reflect instantaneous 
parallel 
 changes 
of 
-100, 
-200, 
+100, 
+200 
and 
+400 
basis 
points 
during the 
succeeding 
twelve-month 
period. 
Simulation 
analyses 
are 
 based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points 
and indexes, interest rate 
 spreads, loan prepayments 
and deposit elasticity. 
Thus, they should 
not be 
relied upon as 
indicative of actual 
results. Further, 
the 
 estimates 
do 
not 
contemplate 
actions 
that 
management 
could 
take 
to 
respond 
to 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates. 
Additionally, 
the 
 Corporation is also subject to 
basis risk in the 
repricing of its assets and 
liabilities, including the basis related 
to using different 
rate 
 indexes for 
the repricing 
of assets and 
liabilities, as 
well as 
the effect 
of pricing 
lags which 
may be 
contractual or 
due to 
historical 
 differences 
in 
the 
timing 
of 
management 
responses 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
rate 
environment. 
By 
their 
nature, 
these 
forward-looking 
 computations are only 
estimates and may 
be different from 
what may actually 
occur in the 
future. The following 
table presents the 
 results of 
the simulations 
at December 
31, 2022 
and December 
31, 2021, 
assuming a 
static balance 
sheet and 
parallel changes 
 over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

 As of December 31, 2022, NII simulations show the Corporation 
has a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the 
rapid 
 increase in short-term 
interest rates throughout the 
year and its 
impact on Puerto 
Rico public sector deposits 
which are indexed to 
 market rates, as well as the deployment of cash to fund loan growth and purchase investments. These results suggest that changes 
 in net interest income are driven by changes in liability 
costs, primarily Puerto Rico public sector deposits. In 
declining rate scenarios 
 net interest income would increase as the decline in 
the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit 
than the changes in asset 
 yields. 
In 
rising 
rate 
scenarios 
Popular s 
sensitivity 
profile 
is 
also 
impacted 
by 
its 
large 
proportion 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
public 
sector 
 deposits which 
are indexed to 
market rates. As 
short-term rates 
have risen, the 
cost of these 
deposits now increases 
in sync 
with 
 market rates and 
therefore reduce the 
benefit banks typically 
have in 
rising rate environments. 
As of 
December 31, 2022, 
Popular 
 has a more neutral 
position as compared to a 
substantially asset sensitive position as 
of December 31, 2021. The 
primary reasons 
 for the 
reduction in sensitivity 
are i) 
the realization of 
much of the 
expected benefit in 
net interest income 
given the 
higher interest 
 rates observed 
during 2022, 
ii) a 
decrease in 
cash balances 
(which reprice 
instantaneously) via 
the deployment 
into longer 
term 
 investments and 
loans, and iii) 
the market 
indexed nature of 
Puerto Rico 
public sector deposits 
which represented 15.2 
billion or 
 25 of deposits as of December 31, 2022. 

 The Corporation s 
loan and 
investment portfolios 
are subject 
to 
prepayment risk, 
which results 
from the 
ability of 
a third-party 
to 
 repay debt 
obligations prior 
to maturity. 
Prepayment risk 
also could 
have a 
significant impact 
on the 
duration of 
mortgage-backed 
 securities 
and 
collateralized 
mortgage 
obligations 
since 
prepayments 
could 
shorten 
(or 
lower 
prepayments 
could 
extend) 
the 
 weighted average life of these portfolios.

 Trading 

 The Corporation 
engages in 
trading activities 
in the 
ordinary course 
of business 
at its 
subsidiaries, BPPR 
and Popular 
Securities. 
 Popular Securities 
trading activities 
consist primarily 
of market-making 
activities to 
meet expected 
customers needs 
related to 
its 
 retail brokerage business, 
and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and 
government sponsored securities with the objective of 
 realizing gains 
from expected 
short-term price 
movements. BPPR s 
trading activities consist 
primarily of 
holding U.S. 
Government 
 sponsored 
mortgage-backed securities 
classified 
as 
 trading and 
hedging 
the 
related 
market 
risk 
with 
 TBA 
(to-be-announced) 
 market 
transactions. 
The 
objective 
is 
to 
derive 
spread 
income 
from 
the 
portfolio 
and 
not 
to 
benefit 
from 
short-term 
market 
 movements. In 
addition, BPPR 
uses forward 
contracts or 
TBAs to 
hedge its 
securitization pipeline. 
Risks related 
to variations 
in 
 interest rates 
and market volatility 
are hedged 
with TBAs 
that have 
characteristics similar to 
that of 
the forecasted security 
and its 
 conversion timeline. 
 At December 31, 2022, 
the Corporation held trading securities 
with a fair value 
of 28 million, representing approximately 0.04 
of 
 the Corporation s total assets, 
compared with 30 million and 0.04 , respectively, at December 31, 2021. As 
shown in Table 15, the 
 trading 
portfolio 
consists 
principally 
of 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
and 
U.S. 
Treasuries, 
which 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
were 
 investment grade 
securities. As 
of December 
31, 2022 
and December 
31, 2021, 
the trading 
portfolio also 
included 0.1 
million in 
 Puerto Rico 
government obligations. 
Trading 
instruments are 
recognized at 
fair value, 
with changes 
resulting from 
fluctuations in 
 market prices, interest rates or exchange rates 
reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized net 
trading account 
 loss of 784 
thousand and a net 
trading account loss of 
 389 thousand, respectively, 
for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 and 
 2021.

 The Corporation s trading activities are 
limited by internal policies. For each 
of the two subsidiaries, the 
market risk assumed under 
 trading 
activities 
is 
measured 
by 
the 
5-day 
net 
value-at-risk VAR ), 
with 
a 
confidence 
level 
of 
99 . 
The 
VAR 
measures 
the 
 maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 
5-day holding period, given a 99 probability. 

 The Corporation s 
trading portfolio 
had a 
5-day VAR 
of approximately 
 0.2 million 
for the 
last week 
in December 
31, 2022. 
There 
 are numerous 
assumptions and 
estimates associated 
with VAR 
modeling, and 
actual results 
could differ 
from these 
assumptions 
 and estimates. 
Backtesting is performed 
to compare 
actual results against 
maximum estimated losses, 
in order 
to evaluate 
model 
 and assumptions accuracy. 

 In the opinion of management, the size and composition 
of the trading portfolio does not represent 
a significant source of market risk 
 for the Corporation. 
 Derivatives 

84 
 Derivatives may 
be 
used by 
the Corporation 
as 
part 
of 
its 
overall interest 
rate risk 
management strategy 
to 
minimize significant 
 unexpected 
fluctuations 
in 
earnings 
and 
cash 
flows 
that 
are 
caused 
by 
interest 
rate 
volatility. 
Derivative 
instruments 
that 
the 
 Corporation may use 
include, among others, 
interest rate caps, 
indexed options, and 
forward contracts. The 
Corporation does not 
 use highly leveraged derivative instruments in its interest rate risk management strategy. Credit risk embedded in these transactions 
 is 
reduced 
by 
requiring 
appropriate 
collateral 
from 
counterparties 
and 
entering 
into 
netting 
agreements 
whenever 
possible. 
All 
 outstanding derivatives are 
recognized in the 
Corporation s Consolidated Statements 
of Condition at 
their fair 
value. Refer

 26 to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further 
information on the 
Corporation s involvement in

 Cash Flow Hedges
 The 
Corporation 
manages 
the 
variability 
of 
cash 
payments 
due 
to 
interest 
rate 
fluctuations 
by 
the 
effective 
use 
of 
derivatives 
 designated 
as 
cash 
flow 
hedges 
and 
that 
are 
linked 
to 
specified 
hedged 
assets 
and 
liabilities. 
The 
cash 
flow 
hedges 
relate 
to 
 forward 
contracts 
or 
TBA 
mortgage-backed securities 
that 
are 
sold 
and 
bought 
for 
future 
settlement to 
hedge 
mortgage-backed 
 securities 
and 
loans 
prior 
to 
securitization. 
The 
seller 
agrees 
to 
deliver 
on 
a 
specified 
future 
date 
a 
specified 
instrument 
at 
a 
 specified price or 
yield. These securities 
are hedging a 
forecasted transaction and 
are designated for 
cash flow hedge 
accounting. 
 The notional 
amount of 
derivatives designated as 
cash flow 
hedges at December 
31, 2022 
amounted to 
15 million 
(2021 - 
 88 
 million). 
Refer 
to 
Note 
26 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
additional 
quantitative 
information 
on 
these 
derivative 
 contracts. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 The 
Corporation did 
not 
have 
any 
derivatives designated 
as 
fair value 
hedges 
during the 
years 
ended December 
31, 
2022 
and 
 2021. 
 Trading and Non-Hedging Derivative Activities 
 The Corporation enters into derivative positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial 
 instruments 
and 
markets 
mostly 
to 
economically 
hedge 
a 
related 
asset 
or 
liability. 
The 
Corporation 
also 
enters 
into 
various 
 derivatives to provide these 
types of derivative products to 
customers. These free-standing derivatives are carried 
at fair value with 
 changes in fair value recorded as part of the results of 
operations for the period. 

 Following 
is 
a 
description 
of 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
derivative 
activities 
that 
are 
not 
designated 
for 
hedge 
 accounting. 

 The Corporation 
has over-the-counter 
option contracts 
which are 
utilized in 
order to 
limit the 
Corporation s exposure 
on customer 
 deposits whose returns are tied 
to the S P 500 
or to certain other 
equity securities or commodity indexes. In 
these certificates, the 
 customer s 
principal 
is 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Corporation 
and 
insured 
by 
the 
FDIC 
to 
the 
maximum 
extent 
permitted 
by 
law. 
The 
 instruments pay a return based 
on the increase of these 
indexes, as applicable, during the term 
of the instrument. Accordingly, 
this 
 product 
gives 
customers 
the 
opportunity 
to 
invest 
in 
a 
product 
that 
protects 
the 
principal 
invested 
but 
allows 
the 
customer 
the 
 potential to earn a return 
based on the performance of the indexes. The 
risk of issuing certificates of deposit 
with returns tied to the 
 applicable indexes is economically hedged by the Corporation. Indexed 
options are purchased from financial institutions with strong 
 credit standings, whose 
return is designed 
to match the 
return payable on 
the certificates of 
deposit issued. By 
hedging the risk 
in 
 this manner, 
the effective cost of 
these deposits is fixed. 
The contracts have a maturity 
and an index equal to 
the terms of the 
pool 
 of retail deposits that they are economically hedging. 

 The purchased 
indexed options 
are used 
to economically 
hedge the 
bifurcated embedded 
option. These 
option contracts 
do not 
 qualify 
for 
hedge 
accounting, 
and 
therefore, 
cannot 
be 
designated 
as 
accounting 
hedges. 
At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
notional 
 amount of 
the indexed 
options on deposits 
approximated 
85 million 
(2021 - 
 79 
million) with 
a fair 
value of 
 18 
million (asset) 
 (2021 - 
26 million) while the 
embedded options had a 
notional value of 
 79 million 
(2021 - 
72 million) with 
a fair value 
of 16 
 million (liability) (2021 - 23 million). 

 Refer to Note 26 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for a 
description of other non-hedging derivative activities utilized 
by the 
 Corporation during 2022 and 2021.

 Foreign Exchange 
 The Corporation holds 
an interest in 
BHD Le n 
in the 
Dominican Republic, which 
is an investment 
accounted for under 
the equity 
 method. The 
Corporation s carrying value 
of the 
equity interest in 
BHD Le n 
approximated 
199.8 million at 
December 31, 2022. 

 This business is conducted in 
the country s foreign currency. 
The resulting foreign currency translation 
adjustment, from operations 
 for 
which 
the 
functional 
currency 
is 
other 
than 
the 
U.S. 
dollar, 
is 
reported 
in 
accumulated 
other 
comprehensive 
loss 
in 
the 
 consolidated 
statements 
of 
condition, 
except 
for 
highly-inflationary 
environments 
in 
which 
the 
effects 
would 
be 
included 
in 
the 
 consolidated statements 
of 
operations. At 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation had 
approximately 
57 million in 
an unfavorable 
 foreign currency translation 
adjustment as part 
of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss), 
compared with an 
unfavorable 
 adjustment of 67 million at December 31, 
2021 and 71 million at December 31, 
2020. 

 Liquidity 

 The objective 
of effective 
liquidity management 
is to 
ensure that 
the Corporation 
has sufficient 
liquidity to 
meet all 
of its 
financial 
 obligations, finance 
expected future 
growth, 
fund 
planned capital 
distributions and 
maintain a 
reasonable safety 
margin for 
cash 
 commitments 
under 
both 
normal 
and 
stressed 
market 
conditions. 
The 
Board 
of 
Directors 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
the 
 Corporation s tolerance for 
liquidity risk, including 
approving relevant risk 
limits and policies. 
The Board of 
Directors has 
delegated 
 the 
monitoring 
of 
these 
risks 
to 
the 
Board s 
Risk 
Management 
Committee 
and 
the 
Asset/Liability 
Management 
Committee. 
The 
 management 
of 
liquidity 
risk, 
on 
a 
long-term 
and 
day-to-day 
basis, 
is 
the 
responsibility of 
the 
Corporate 
Treasury 
Division. 
The 
 Corporation s Corporate Treasurer 
is responsible for implementing 
the policies and 
procedures approved by the 
Board of Directors 
 and 
for 
monitoring 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis. 
Also, 
the 
Corporate 
Treasury 
Division 
coordinates 
 corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages 
 the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and 
 reporting of adherence with established policies. 
 An institution s liquidity 
may be pressured 
if, for example, 
it experiences a 
sudden and unexpected 
substantial cash outflow 
due to 
 exogenous events such 
as the COVID-19 
pandemic, 
its credit rating 
is downgraded, or 
some other event 
causes counterparties to 
 avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, 
such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its 
 principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect 
its ability to obtain funding. 

 Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of 
the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It 
 is also managed at the 
level of the banking and 
non-banking subsidiaries. As further explained below, 
a principal source of liquidity 
 for the 
bank holding 
companies (the BHCs 
are dividends 
received from 
banking and 
non-banking subsidiaries. The 
Corporation 
 has adopted 
policies and limits 
to monitor 
more effectively 
the Corporation s 
liquidity position 
and that of 
the banking subsidiaries. 
 Additionally, contingency funding 
plans are used to 
model various stress events 
of different magnitudes and 
affecting different time 
 horizons that assist 
management in evaluating 
the size of 
the liquidity buffers 
needed if those 
stress events 
occur. However, 
such 
 models 
may 
not 
predict 
accurately 
how 
the 
market 
and 
customers 
might 
react 
to 
every 
event, 
and 
are 
dependent 
on 
many 
 assumptions. 
 Deposits, including 
customer deposits, 
brokered deposits 
and public 
funds deposits, 
continue to 
be the 
most significant 
source of 
 funds for 
the Corporation, 
funding 
91 of 
the Corporation s 
total assets 
at December 
31, 2022 
and 89 
at December 
31, 2021. 

 The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 
52 at December 31, 2022, compared to 44 at December 31, 2021. 
In addition to 
 traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing 
arrangements, which amounted to approximately 
 1.4 billion in outstanding 
 balances at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - 1.2 billion). A detailed 
description of the Corporation s borrowings, including 
 their terms, 
is included 
in Note 
17 to 
the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Also, the 
Consolidated Statements of 
Cash Flows 
in 
 the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide 
information on the Corporation s cash inflows and outflows. 
 On 
July 
12, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
completed 
an 
ASR 
program 
for 
the 
repurchase 
of 
an 
aggregate 
 400 
million 
of 
Popular s 
 common stock, 
for which 
an initial 
3,483,942 shares 
were delivered 
in March 
2022 (the 
 March ASR 
Agreement ). Upon 
the final 
 settlement 
of 
the 
March 
ASR 
Agreement, 
the 
Corporation 
received 
an 
additional 
1,582,922 
shares 
of 
common 
stock. 
The 
 Corporation repurchased a 
total of 
5,066,864 shares 
at an 
average purchase 
price of 
 78.9443, which 
were recorded 
as treasury 
 stock by 440 million under the March ASR Agreement. 

86 
 On December 
7, 2022, 
the Corporation 
completed the 
settlement of 
another ASR 
Agreement for 
the repurchase 
of an 
aggregate 
 231 
million 
of 
Popular s common 
stock, 
for 
which 
an 
initial 
2,339,241 shares 
were 
delivered 
on 
August 
26, 
2022 
(the 
 August 
 ASR ). Upon the 
final settlement of 
the ASR Agreement, 
the Corporation received 
an additional 840,024 
shares of common 
stock. 
 The Corporation repurchased a total of 
3,179,265 shares at an average purchase price of 
 72.66, which were recorded as treasury 
 stock by 
 245 million under 
the August ASR 
Agreement. 
Refer to Note 
20 to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
additional 
 information. 

 The 
following 
sections 
provide 
further 
information 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
major 
funding 
activities 
and 
needs, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
risks 
 involved in these activities. 
 Banking Subsidiaries 
 Primary 
sources of 
funding 
for the 
Corporation s 
banking subsidiaries 
(BPPR and 
PB 
or, 
collectively, 
 the banking 
subsidiaries 
 include 
retail, 
commercial 
and 
public 
sector 
deposits, 
brokered 
deposits, 
unpledged 
investment 
securities, 
mortgage 
loan 
 securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In 
addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the 
 discount window 
of the 
Federal Reserve 
Bank of 
New York 
(the FRB 
and has 
a considerable 
amount of 
collateral pledged 
that 
 can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

 Refer 
to 
Note 
17 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, 
for 
additional 
information 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
borrowing 
facilities 
 available through its banking subsidiaries. 

 The principal 
uses of 
funds for 
the banking 
subsidiaries include 
loan originations, 
investment portfolio 
purchases, loan 
purchases 
 and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 
 expenses. Also, the 
banking subsidiaries assume liquidity 
risk related to collateral 
posting requirements for certain 
activities mainly 
 in 
connection 
with 
contractual 
commitments, 
recourse 
provisions, 
servicing 
advances, 
derivatives 
and 
credit 
card 
licensing 
 agreements. 

 The banking 
subsidiaries maintain 
sufficient funding 
capacity to 
address large 
increases in 
funding requirements 
such as 
deposit 
 outflows. 
The 
Corporation has 
established 
liquidity 
guidelines 
that 
require 
the 
banking 
subsidiaries 
to 
have 
sufficient 
liquidity 
to 
 cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

 The Corporation s ability to compete 
successfully in the marketplace for 
deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 
 factors, including 
pricing, service, 
convenience and 
financial stability 
as reflected 
by operating 
results, credit 
ratings (by 
nationally 
 recognized 
credit 
rating 
agencies), 
and 
importantly, 
FDIC 
deposit 
insurance. 
Although 
a 
downgrade 
in 
the 
credit 
ratings 
of 
the 
 Corporation s banking 
subsidiaries may 
impact their 
ability to 
raise retail 
and commercial 
deposits or 
the rate 
that it 
is required 
to 
 pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation s banking 
 subsidiaries are federally insured 
(subject to FDIC 
limits) and this 
is expected to 
mitigate the potential effect 
of a downgrade 
in the 
 credit ratings. 

 Deposits are a 
key source of 
funding as they 
tend to be 
less volatile than institutional 
borrowings and their 
cost is less 
sensitive to 
 changes in 
market rates. 
Refer to 
Table 
8 for 
a breakdown 
of deposits 
by major 
types. Core 
deposits are 
generated from 
a large 
 base of consumer, corporate and 
public sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings 
deposits 
 and certificates 
of deposit 
under 250,000, 
excluding brokered 
deposits with 
denominations under 
 250,000. Core 
deposits have 
 historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled 57.6 billion, 
 or 
94 of total deposits, at December 31, 2022, compared with 63.6 billion, or 95 of 
total deposits, at December 31, 2021. Core 
 deposits financed 90 of the Corporation s earning assets 
at December 31, 2022, compared with 88 
at December 31, 2021. 

 The distribution by maturity of 
certificates of deposits with denominations of 
 250,000 and over at December 31, 
2022 is presented 
 in the table that follows:

 The Corporation 
had 1.1 
billion in 
brokered deposits 
at December 
31, 2022, 
which financed 
approximately 2 
of its 
total assets 
 (December 31, 2021 - 
 0.8 billion and 1 , 
respectively). 
In the event that 
any of the Corporation s 
banking subsidiaries regulatory 
 capital 
ratios fall 
below those 
required by 
a well-capitalized 
institution or 
are subject 
to capital 
restrictions by 
the regulators, 
that 
 banking subsidiary faces 
the risk of 
not being able 
to raise or 
maintain brokered deposits 
and faces limitations 
on the rate 
paid on 
 deposits, which 
may hinder 
the Corporation s 
ability to 
effectively compete 
in its 
retail markets 
and could 
affect its 
deposit raising 
 efforts. 

 Deposits from 
the public 
sector represent an 
important source of 
funds for 
the Corporation. 
As of 
December 31, 2022, 
total public 
 sector deposits were 15.2 billion, 
compared to 20.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Generally, 
these deposits require that the bank 
 pledge high credit quality securities as 
collateral; 
therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector 
deposit outflows are lower given 
 that the bank 
receives its collateral 
in return. This, 
now unpledged, collateral 
can either be 
financed via repurchase 
agreements or 
 sold for cash. However, there are some 
timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the 
bank receives 
 its 
collateral. 
Additionally, 
the 
Corporation 
mainly 
utilizes 
fixed-rate 
U.S. 
Treasury 
debt 
securities 
as 
collateral. 
While 
these 
 securities have 
limited credit risk, 
they are 
subject to 
market value 
risk based on 
changes in 
the interest rate 
environment. 
When 
 interest 
rates 
increase, 
the 
value 
of 
this 
collateral 
decreases 
and 
could 
result 
in 
the 
Corporation 
having 
to 
provide 
additional 
 collateral 
to 
cover 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
deposit 
liabilities. 
This 
additional 
collateral 
could 
reduce 
unpledged 
securities 
otherwise 
 available as liquidity sources to the Corporation. 

 At December 31, 2022, 
management believes that the 
banking subsidiaries had sufficient current 
and projected liquidity sources to 
 meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, 
as well as special needs 
and off-balance sheet commitments, in the 
ordinary course of 
 business and have sufficient 
liquidity resources to address a 
stress event. Although the 
banking subsidiaries have historically been 
 able to replace 
maturing deposits and advances, 
no assurance can 
be given that 
they would be 
able to replace 
those funds in 
the 
 future if the 
Corporation s financial condition 
or general market 
conditions were to 
deteriorate. The Corporation s 
financial flexibility 
 will 
be 
severely constrained 
if 
the 
banking subsidiaries 
are 
unable to 
maintain access 
to 
funding 
or 
if 
adequate financing 
is 
not 
 available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The 
banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit 
 cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase 
agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To 
 the extent that 
the value of securities 
previously pledged as collateral 
declines because of market 
changes, the Corporation will 
be 

88 
 required to 
deposit additional cash 
or securities to 
meet its 
margin requirements, thereby 
adversely affecting its 
liquidity. Finally, 
if 
 management 
is 
required 
to 
rely 
more 
heavily 
on 
more 
expensive 
funding 
sources 
to 
meet 
its 
future 
growth, 
revenues 
may 
not 
 increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, 
profitability would be adversely affected. 
 Bank Holding Companies 
 The principal 
sources of 
funding for 
the BHCs, 
which are 
Popular, 
Inc. 
(holding company 
only) and 
PNA, include 
cash on 
hand, 
 investment 
securities, 
dividends 
received from 
banking 
and 
non-banking subsidiaries, 
asset sales, 
credit 
facilities 
available from 
 affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. 
Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 
 are subject to various regulatory limits 
and authorization requirements that are further described 
below and that may limit the 
ability 
 of those subsidiaries to act as a source of 
funding to the BHCs. 
 The 
principal 
use 
of 
these 
funds 
includes 
the 
repayment 
of 
debt, 
and 
interest 
payments 
to 
holders 
of 
senior 
debt 
and 
junior 
 subordinated 
deferrable 
interest 
(related 
to 
trust 
preferred 
securities), 
the 
payment 
of 
dividends 
to 
common 
stockholders, 
 repurchases of the Corporation s securities and capitalizing its 
banking subsidiaries. 

 The 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
notes 
payable 
at 
the 
BHCs 
amounted 
to 
 497 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
 496 
million 
at 
 December 31, 2021. 
 The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable 
at December 31, 2022 are presented in 
Table 18.

 The Corporation s 
6.125 unsecured senior 
debt securities mature 
in the 
September of 2023. 
Annual debt service 
at the BHCs 
is 
 approximately 32 
million, 
and 
the 
Corporation s 
latest 
quarterly dividend 
was 
 0.55 
per share 
or 
approximately 40 
million 
per 
 quarter. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
BHCs 
had 
cash 
and 
money 
markets 
investments 
totaling 
 203 
million 
and 
borrowing 
 potential of 
 169 million 
from its 
secured facility 
with BPPR. 
The BHCs 
liquidity position 
continues to 
be adequate 
with sufficient 
 cash 
on 
hand, 
investments 
and 
other 
sources 
of 
liquidity 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
enough 
to 
meet 
all 
interest 
payments 
and 
 dividend obligations during the 
foreseeable future. The Corporation 
intends to refinance 
the 6.125 unsecured senior 
debt prior to 
 its 
maturity in 
September. 
If 
we are 
unable to 
refinance these 
notes, we 
could have 
to 
declare extraordinary 
dividends from 
our 
 banking and other operating 
subsidiaries to repay such 
notes. Our ability to 
declare such dividends could 
be subject to 
approval of 
 the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The BHCs have in 
the past borrowed in the 
corporate debt market primarily to finance 
their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 
 debt obligations. These 
sources of funding 
are more costly 
due to the 
fact that two 
out of the 
three principal credit 
rating agencies 
 rate the Corporation below investment grade , which 
affects the Corporation s cost and 
ability to raise funds in 
the capital markets. 
 Factors that the Corporation 
does not control, such 
as the economic outlook, 
interest rate volatility, 
inflation, disruptions in the 
debt 
 market, among others, 
could also affect 
its ability to 
obtain funding. The 
Corporation has an 
automatic shelf registration 
statement 
 filed and effective 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which permits the Corporation 
to issue an 
unspecified amount of 
 debt or equity securities. 
 On July 1, 
2022, the Corporation exchanged a 
portion of Evertec shares as 
part of a transaction 
in which it acquired 
certain critical 
 channels from Evertec and renegotiated several service agreements. The Corporation completed the sale of its remaining shares of 
 Evertec on August 15, 2022. Following the 
Evertec Stock Sale, Popular no longer owns any 
Evertec common stock. 
 Non-Banking Subsidiaries 
 The 
principal 
sources 
of 
funding 
for 
the 
non-banking 
subsidiaries 
include 
internally 
generated 
cash 
flows 
from 
operations, 
loan 
 sales, repurchase agreements, capital 
injections and borrowed funds 
from their direct 
parent companies or the 
holding companies. 
 The principal uses of funds for the non-banking 
subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, 
operational expenses and payment 
 of dividends to the 
BHCs. The liquidity needs 
of the non-banking subsidiaries 
are minimal since most 
of them are 
funded internally 
 from operating cash flows or from 
intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding 
companies. During the period 

89 
 ended December 
31, 2022, 
Popular, Inc. 
made capital 
contributions to its 
wholly owned subsidiaries 
of 25 
million to 
Popular Re, 
 Inc., 10 million to Popular Securities, 
LLC and 3 million to Popular Impact Fund, LLC. 
 Dividends 
 During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
declared 
cash 
dividends 
of 
 2.20 
per 
common 
share 
outstanding 
 163.7 million in the aggregate). The 
dividends for the Corporation s Series 
A preferred stock amounted to 1.4 
million. During the 
 year ended 
December 31, 
2022, the 
BHCs received 
dividends amounting 
to 450 
million from 
BPPR, 54 
million from 
PNA, 
 19 
 million 
from 
PIBI, 
 8 million 
in dividends 
from 
its 
non-banking subsidiaries 
and 
 2 million 
in 
dividends from 
Evertec. 
In 
addition, 
 during the year ended December 31, 2022, Popular International 
Bank Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Popular, Inc., received 16 
 million in dividends from its investment in BHD. 
Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc. s primary source of liquidity. 

 Other Funding Sources and Capital 
 The 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
provides 
an 
additional 
source 
of 
liquidity, 
which 
may 
be 
realized 
through 
either 
securities 
sales 
or 
 repurchase agreements. The Corporation s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt securities, U.S. 
 government 
sponsored 
agency 
debt 
securities, 
U.S. 
government 
sponsored 
agency 
mortgage-backed 
securities, 
and 
U.S. 
 government 
sponsored 
agency 
collateralized 
mortgage 
obligations 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
raise 
funds 
in 
the 
repo 
markets. 
The 
 availability 
of 
the 
repurchase 
agreement 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
having 
sufficient 
unpledged 
collateral 
available 
at 
the 
time 
the 
 transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation s 
 unpledged debt 
securities amounted 
to 
 8.0 
billion at 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
 3.0 billion 
at 
December 31, 
2021. A 
substantial 
 portion of these debt securities could be used to 
raise financing in the U.S. money markets or 
from secured lending sources. 
 Additional liquidity may 
be provided through 
loan maturities, prepayments 
and sales. The 
loan portfolio can 
also be used 
to obtain 
 funding in the capital markets. In particular, 
mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have 
secondary markets which the 
 Corporation could use. 
 Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 
 In the ordinary course 
of business, the Corporation 
engages in financial transactions that 
are not recorded on 
the balance sheet or 
 may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 
 provider of 
financial services, 
the Corporation 
routinely enters 
into commitments 
with off-balance 
sheet risk 
to meet 
the financial 
 needs of 
its customers. These 
commitments may include 
loan commitments and 
standby letters of 
credit. These commitments 
are 
 subject 
to 
the 
same 
credit 
policies 
and 
approval 
process 
used 
for 
on-balance 
sheet 
instruments. 
These 
instruments 
involve, 
to 
 varying degrees, elements 
of credit and 
interest rate risk 
in excess of 
the amount recognized 
in the statement 
of financial position. 
 Refer to 
Note 24 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
information on 
the Corporation s 
commitments to 
extent credit 
and 
 other non-credit commitments. 

 Other types 
of off-balance 
sheet arrangements 
that the 
Corporation enters 
in the 
ordinary course 
of business 
include derivatives, 
 operating 
leases 
and 
provision 
of 
guarantees, 
indemnifications, 
and 
representation 
and 
warranties. 
Refer 
to 
Note 
33 
to 
the 
 Consolidated Financial Statements for information on operating leases and

discussion 
related 
to 
the 
Corporation s 
obligations 
under 
credit 
recourse 
and 
representation 
and 
warranties 
 arrangements. 

 The Corporation monitors 
its cash requirements, 
including its contractual obligations 
and debt commitments. 
As discussed above, 
 liquidity 
is 
managed 
by 
the 
Corporation in 
order to 
meet 
its 
short- 
and 
long-term cash 
obligations. Note 
17 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
 Financial Statements has information on 
the Corporation s borrowings by maturity, 
which amounted to 1.4 
billion at December 31, 
 2022 (December 31, 2021 - 1.2 billion).
 Financial information of guarantor and issuers of registered 
guaranteed securities 
 The Corporation (not 
including any of 
its subsidiaries, PIHC 
is the parent 
holding company of 
Popular North America 
 PNA and 
 has other subsidiaries through which it 
conducts its financial services operations. PNA is 
an operating, 100 subsidiary of Popular, 
 Inc. 
Holding Company PIHC and 
is the 
holding company 
of its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries: 
Equity One, 
Inc. 
and PB, 
including 
 PB s wholly-owned subsidiaries Popular Equipment Finance, 
LLC, Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc. 
 PNA 
has 
issued 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
guaranteed 
by 
PIHC 
(together 
with 
PNA, 
the 
 obligor 
group 
purchased 
by 
 statutory trusts 
established by 
the Corporation. 
These debentures 
were purchased 
by the 
statutory trust 
using the 
proceeds from 

90 
 trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as 
 capital securities ), together with the proceeds of the related issuances 
 of common securities of the trusts. 
 PIHC 
fully 
and 
unconditionally 
guarantees 
the 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
issued 
by 
PNA. 
PIHC s 
obligation 
to 
make 
a 
 guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct 
payment of the required amounts to the 
holders of the applicable capital securities or 
 by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions 
 by 
the 
applicable 
trust 
except 
to 
the 
extent 
such 
trust 
has 
funds 
available 
for 
such 
payments. 
If 
PIHC 
does 
not 
make 
interest 
 payments on the 
debentures held by such 
trust, such trust 
will not pay 
distributions on the applicable 
capital securities and 
will not 
 have 
funds 
available 
for 
such 
payments. 
PIHC s 
guarantee 
of 
PNA s 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
is 
unsecured 
and 
ranks 
 subordinate and junior in 
right of payment to 
all the PIHC s other 
liabilities in the same manner 
as the applicable debentures as 
set 
 forth in the applicable indentures and equally with all other guarantees 
that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee 
 of 
payment 
and 
not 
of 
collection, 
which means 
that 
the 
guaranteed party 
may 
sue 
the 
guarantor to 
enforce its 
rights 
under the 
 respective guarantee without suing any other person 
or entity. 
 The 
principal 
sources 
of 
funding 
for 
PIHC 
and 
PNA 
have 
included 
dividends 
received 
from 
their 
banking 
and 
non-banking 
 subsidiaries, asset 
sales and 
proceeds from 
the issuance 
of debt 
and equity. 
As further 
described below, 
in the 
Risk to 
Liquidity 
 section, various statutory 
provisions limit the 
amount of dividends 
an insured depository 
institution may pay 
to its holding 
company 
 without regulatory approval. 

 The 
following 
summarized 
financial

 Risks to Liquidity 
 Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing 
basis. Some of these lines 
 could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory 
requirements, among 
 other factors. 
Derivatives, such 
as those 
embedded in 
long-term repurchase 
transactions or 
interest rate 
swaps, and 
off-balance 
 sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their 
 fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, 
thereby reducing the balance of unpledged 
securities. 
 The importance of 
the Puerto Rico 
market for the 
Corporation is an 
additional risk factor 
that could affect 
its financing activities. 
In 
 the case 
of a 
deterioration in economic 
and fiscal conditions 
in Puerto Rico, 
the credit quality 
of the 
Corporation could be 
affected 
 and result 
in higher 
credit costs. 
Refer to 
the Geographic 
and Government 
Risk section 
of this 
MD A for 
some highlights 
on the 
 current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing 
fiscal crisis. 
 Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic 
outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory 
 changes, 
could also 
affect 
its 
ability to 
obtain funding. 
In 
order to 
prepare for 
the 
possibility of 
such scenario, 
management has 
 adopted 
contingency 
plans 
for 
raising 
financing 
under 
stress 
scenarios 
when 
important 
sources 
of 
funds 
that 
are 
usually 
fully 
 available 
are 
temporarily 
unavailable. These 
plans call 
for 
using 
alternate 
funding 
mechanisms, 
such 
as 
the 
pledging 
of 
certain 
 asset classes 
and accessing 
secured credit 
lines and 
loan facilities 
put in 
place with 
the FHLB 
and the 
FRB. The 
Corporation is 
 subject to 
positive tangible 
capital 
requirements to 
utilize secured 
loan facilities 
with the 
FHLB that 
could 
result in 
a limitation 
of 
 borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation 
exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. 

 The credit 
ratings of 
Popular s debt 
obligations are 
a relevant 
factor for 
liquidity because 
they impact 
the Corporation s 
ability to 
 borrow 
in 
the 
capital 
markets, 
its 
cost 
and 
access 
to 
funding 
sources. 
Credit 
ratings 
are 
based 
on 
the 
financial 
strength, 
credit 
 quality and 
concentrations in 
the loan 
portfolio, the 
level and 
volatility of 
earnings, capital 
adequacy, 
the quality 
of management, 
 geographic concentration 
in Puerto 
Rico, the 
liquidity of 
the balance 
sheet, the 
availability of 
a significant 
base of 
core retail 
and 
 commercial deposits, and the Corporation s ability 
to access a broad array of wholesale funding 
sources, among other factors. 

 Furthermore, 
various 
statutory 
provisions 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
dividends 
an 
insured 
depository 
institution 
may 
pay 
to 
its 
holding 
 company without 
regulatory approval. A 
member bank must 
obtain the 
approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve Board 
for any 
dividend, if 
 the total 
of all 
dividends declared 
by the 
member bank 
during the 
calendar year 
would exceed 
the total 
of its 
net income 
for that 
 year, 
combined with 
its retained 
net income 
for the 
preceding two 
years, after 
considering those 
years dividend 
activity, 
less any 
 required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred 
stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, BPPR 
 declared 
cash 
dividends of 
 450 million, 
a 
portion of 
which was 
used by 
Popular for 
the 
payments of 
the 
cash 
dividends on 
its 
 outstanding common stock and 231 million in accelerated 
stock repurchases. 
At December 31, 2022, BPPR needed to obtain prior 
 approval of the Federal Reserve Board before 
declaring a dividend in excess of 53 million 
due to its declared dividend activity and 
 transfers to statutory reserves over the three years ended 
December 31, 2022. In addition, a member bank 
may not declare or pay a 
 dividend in an amount greater than its 
undivided profits as reported in its Report of 
Condition and Income, unless the member bank 
 has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member 
bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital 
to 
 be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by 
the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB 
may not 
 declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. The ability of a bank subsidiary 
 to up-stream dividends to its BHC could thus 
be impacted by its financial performance and capital, including tangible and 
regulatory 
 capital, thus potentially limiting the 
amount of cash moving 
up to the BHCs from 
the banking subsidiaries. This could, 
in turn, affect 
 the 
BHCs 
ability to 
declare dividends 
on 
its 
outstanding common 
and 
preferred stock, 
repurchase its 
securities 
or meet 
its 
debt 
 obligations, for example. 

 The Corporation s banking subsidiaries have historically not 
used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, 
and 
 therefore are less sensitive to the level and 
changes in the Corporation s overall credit ratings. 
 Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 
 The 
Corporation s 
banking 
subsidiaries 
currently 
do 
not 
use 
borrowings 
that 
are 
rated 
by 
the 
major 
rating 
agencies, 
as 
these 
 banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had 9 million in deposits 
 at December 31, 2022 that are subject to 
rating triggers. 

 In addition, certain 
mortgage servicing and custodial 
agreements that BPPR has 
with third parties 
include rating covenants. 
In the 
 event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 
 escrow 
deposits 
and/or 
increase 
collateral 
levels 
securing 
the 
recourse 
obligations. 
Also, 
as 
discussed 
in 
Note 
23 
to 
the 
 Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, 
the 
Corporation 
services 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
subject 
to 
credit 
recourse 
provisions. 

93 
 Certain 
contractual 
agreements 
require 
the 
Corporation 
to 
post 
collateral 
to 
secure 
such 
recourse 
obligations 
if 
the 
institution s 
 required 
credit 
ratings 
are 
not 
maintained. 
Collateral 
pledged 
by 
the 
Corporation 
to 
secure 
recourse 
obligations 
amounted 
to 
 approximately 
 29 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2022. 
The 
Corporation 
could 
be 
required 
to 
post 
additional 
collateral 
under 
the 
 agreements. 
Management 
expects 
that 
it 
would 
be 
able 
to 
meet 
additional 
collateral 
requirements 
if 
and 
when 
needed. 
The 
 requirements 
to 
post 
collateral under 
certain 
agreements or 
the 
loss 
of 
escrow deposits 
could 
reduce 
the 
Corporation s liquidity 
 resources and impact its operating results.
 Credit Risk 
 Geographic and Government Risk 

 The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. 
The Corporation s assets and revenue composition by geographical 
 area and by business segment reporting are presented 
in Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
 A 
significant portion 
of 
our financial 
activities and 
credit 
exposure is 
concentrated in 
the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico Puerto 
 Rico ), which has faced severe economic and fiscal 
challenges in the past and may face additional 
challenges in the future. 

 Economic Performance. 

 Puerto 
Rico s 
economy suffered 
a 
severe and 
prolonged recession 
from 
2007 
to 
2017, 
with real 
gross national 
product GNP 
 contracting approximately 15 during this 
period. 
In 2017, Hurricane Mar a 
caused significant damage and destruction 
across the 
 island, resulting in further economic contraction. 
Puerto Rico s economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in part aided by 
 the large amount 
of federal disaster 
relief and recovery 
assistance funds injected 
into the Puerto 
Rico economy in 
connection with 
 Hurricane Mar a 
and other 
recent natural 
disasters. This 
growth was 
interrupted by 
the economic 
shock caused 
by the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part 
aided by additional federal assistance from 
pandemic-related stimulus measures. 
 The 
latest 
Puerto 
Rico 
Economic Activity 
Index, 
published 
by 
the 
Economic 
Development Bank 
for 
Puerto 
Rico 
(the 
 Economic 
 Activity 
Index ), 
reflected 
a 
0.6 
increase 
in 
December 
2022, 
compared 
to 
December 
2021. 
During 
calendar 
year 
2022, 
the 
 Economic Activity Index increased by 1.8 , 
compared to the same period in 
calendar year 2021. 
The Economic Activity Index is 
a 
 coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a 
direct measurement of real GNP. 
According to the Puerto Rico Planning 
 Board s latest economic forecast (dated August 2021), Puerto Rico s 
real GNP is projected to increase 1.7 during the 
current fiscal 
 year (July 2022-June 2023). 
 While the 
Puerto Rico 
economy has 
not directly 
tracked the 
United States 
economy in 
recent years, 
many of 
the external 
factors 
 that impact the 
Puerto Rico economy 
are affected by 
the policies and 
performance of the 
United States economy. 
These external 
 factors include 
the level 
of interest 
rates and 
the rate 
of inflation. 
Inflation in 
the United 
States, as 
measured by the 
United States 
 Consumer Price Index 
(published by the 
U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics), increased 
6.5 in calendar 
year 2022, mainly 
driven by 
 pent-up 
demand 
and 
supply-chain 
disruptions 
caused 
by 
the 
pandemic. 
During 
the 
same 
period, 
inflation 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
as 
 measured by the Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index (published by the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico), 
 increased 6.1 
for similar 
reasons. 
The rate 
of inflation 
has slowed 
down in 
recent months, 
following a 
mid-2022 peak, 
as the 
 Federal Reserve has 
implemented a series 
of benchmark interest 
rate increases. 
The speed 
and scope of 
the inflation slowdown 
 will inform 
if and 
how much 
interest rates 
will continue 
to increase, 
as well 
how these 
changes will 
impact the 
United States 
and 
 Puerto Rico economies. 

94 
 Fiscal Challenges. 

 As the 
Puerto Rico 
economy contracted, the 
government s public 
debt rose 
rapidly, 
in part 
from borrowing to 
cover deficits 
to pay 
 debt service, pension 
benefits and other 
government expenditures. 
By 2016, the 
Puerto Rico government 
had over 120 
billion in 
 combined debt and unfunded 
pension liabilities, had lost access to the capital 
markets, and was in the midst of a fiscal 
crisis. 
 Puerto 
Rico s 
escalating fiscal 
and economic 
challenges 
and imminent 
widespread defaults 
in 
its 
public debt 
prompted the 
U.S. 
 Congress to 
enact the 
Puerto Rico 
Oversight, Management, 
and Economic 
Stability Act PROMESA in 
June 2016. 
PROMESA 
 created the Oversight Board with ample powers over Puerto Rico s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 
 instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, PR 
Government Entities ). 
Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will 
be in 
 place 
until 
market 
access 
is 
restored 
and 
balanced 
budgets 
are 
produced 
for 
at 
least 
four 
consecutive 
years. 
PROMESA 
also 
 established two 
mechanisms for 
the restructuring 
of the 
obligations of 
PR Government 
Entities: (a) 
Title III, 
which provides 
an in-
 court process that incorporates many of the 
powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
and permits adjustment of a broad 
 range of obligations, and 
(b) Title VI, 
which provides for a 
largely out-of-court process through which 
modifications to financial debt 
 can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors 
and bind holdouts. 
 Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several 
of its instrumentalities have availed themselves 
of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 
 III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 
 including Government 
Development Bank for 
Puerto Rico, 
the Puerto 
Rico Sales 
Tax 
Financing Corporation, and 
the Puerto 
Rico 
 Highways 
and 
Transportation 
Authority, 
have 
also 
completed 
debt 
restructurings 
under 
Titles 
III 
or 
VI 
of 
PROMESA. 
While 
the 
 majority 
of 
the 
debt 
has 
already 
been 
restructured, 
some 
PR 
Government 
Entities 
still 
face 
significant 
fiscal 
challenges. 
For 
 example, the 
Puerto Rico 
Electric Power 
Authority is 
still in 
the process 
of restructuring 
its debts 
under Title 
III of 
PROMESA and 
 other PR Government 
Entities, such as 
the Puerto Rico 
Industrial Development Company, 
have defaulted on 
their bonds but 
have 
 not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under 
PROMESA. 

 Municipalities. 

 Puerto Rico s fiscal and economic challenges have 
also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities 
 have 
gradually 
declined 
in 
recent 
years 
and 
are 
scheduled 
to 
be 
ultimately 
eliminated 
by 
fiscal 
year 
2025 
as 
part 
of 
the 
fiscal 
 measures 
required 
by 
the 
Oversight 
Board. 
According 
to 
the 
latest 
Puerto 
Rico 
fiscal 
plan 
certified 
by 
the 
Oversight 
Board, 
 municipalities 
have 
made 
little 
to 
no 
progress 
towards 
implementing 
the 
fiscal 
discipline 
required 
to 
reduce 
reliance 
on 
these 
 budgetary appropriations and this 
lack of fiscal 
management may threaten the 
ability of certain 
municipalities to provide 
necessary 
 services, such as health, sanitation, public safety 
and emergency services to their residents, forcing them 
to prioritize expenditures. 
 Municipalities 
are 
subject 
to 
PROMESA 
and, 
at 
the 
Oversight 
Board s 
request, 
are 
required 
to 
submit 
fiscal 
plans 
and 
annual 
 budgets 
to 
the 
Oversight 
Board 
for 
its 
review 
and 
approval. 
They 
are 
also 
required to 
seek 
Oversight 
Board 
approval 
to 
issue, 
 guarantee 
or 
modify 
their 
debts 
and 
to 
enter 
into 
contracts 
with an 
aggregate 
value 
of 
 10 
million 
or 
more. 
With 
the 
Oversight 
 Board s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To 
 date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt 
restructuring process. 

 Exposure of the Corporation 

 The credit 
quality of BPPR s 
loan portfolio 
reflects, among other 
things, the 
general economic conditions 
in Puerto 
Rico and 
other 
 adverse conditions affecting Puerto 
Rico consumers and businesses. 
Deterioration in the Puerto 
Rico economy has resulted 
in the 
 past, and could 
result in the future, 
in higher delinquencies, greater 
charge-offs and increased losses, 
which could materially affect 
 our financial condition and results of operations. 

 At 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation s direct 
exposure to 
PR Government 
Entities totaled 
 374 
million, of 
which 327 
million 
 were 
outstanding, 
compared 
to 
 367 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2021, 
of 
which 
 349 
million 
were 
outstanding. 
A 
deterioration 
in 
 Puerto Rico s fiscal 
and economic situation could adversely 
affect the value of 
our Puerto Rico government 
obligations, resulting in 
 losses to us. Of 
the amount outstanding, 302 million 
consists of loans and 
 25 million are securities 319 
million and 30 million, 
 respectively, 
at December 
31, 2021). 
All of 
the Corporation s 
direct exposure 
outstanding at 
December 31, 
2022 were 
obligations 
 from various 
Puerto Rico 
municipalities. In 
most cases, 
these were 
 general obligations 
of a 
municipality, 
to which 
the applicable 
 municipality 
has 
pledged its 
good 
faith, credit 
and unlimited 
taxing power, 
or 
 special obligations 
of 
a municipality, 
to 
which the 
 applicable 
municipality 
has 
pledged basic 
property tax 
or 
sales 
tax 
revenues. At 
December 31, 
2022, 
73 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
 exposure to municipal loans 
and securities was concentrated in 
the municipalities of San Juan, 
Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam n. 

95 
 For 
additional 
discussion 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
direct 
exposure 
to 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government 
and 
its 
instrumentalities 
and 
 municipalities, refer to Note 24 Commitments and 
Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 In 
addition, 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 251 
million 
in 
loans 
insured 
or 
securities 
issued 
by 
Puerto 
Rico 
 governmental entities, 
but for 
which the 
principal source 
of repayment 
is non-governmental 275 million at 
December 31, 2021). 
 These 
included 
 209 
million 
in 
residential mortgage 
loans 
insured by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Housing 
Finance Authority HFA ), 
a 
PR 
 Government 
Entity 
(December 
31, 
2021 
- 
 232 million). 
These 
mortgage 
loans 
are 
secured 
by 
first 
mortgages 
on 
Puerto 
Rico 
 residential properties 
and the 
HFA insurance 
covers losses 
in the 
event of 
a borrower 
default and 
upon the 
satisfaction of 
certain 
 other 
conditions. 
The 
Corporation also 
had, 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 42 
million 
in 
bonds 
issued 
by 
HFA 
which 
are 
secured 
by 
 second 
mortgage loans 
on Puerto 
Rico 
residential properties, 
and for 
which HFA 
also provides 
insurance to 
cover losses 
in the 
 event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of 
certain other conditions (December 31, 2021 - 43 million). 
In the event that 
 the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those 
serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and 
 the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA s 
ability to honor its insurance will depend, among 
 other factors, 
on the 
financial condition 
of HFA 
at the 
time such 
obligations become 
due and 
payable. The 
Corporation does 
not 
 consider the government guarantee when estimating 
the credit losses associated with this portfolio. 

 BPPR s 
commercial loan 
portfolio also 
includes loans 
to 
private borrowers 
who 
are service 
providers, lessors, 
suppliers or 
have 
 other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively 
affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and 
economic 
 situation 
of 
PR 
Government 
Entities. 
Similarly, 
BPPR s 
mortgage 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolios 
include 
loans 
to 
government 
 employees 
and 
retirees, 
which 
could 
also 
be 
negatively 
affected 
by 
fiscal 
measures, 
such 
as 
employee 
layoffs 
or 
furloughs 
or 
 reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic 
situation deteriorates. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
BPPR 
had 
 15.2 
billion 
in 
deposits 
from 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government, 
its 
instrumentalities, 
and 
 municipalities. The rate at 
which public deposit balances may 
decline is uncertain and 
difficult to predict. The 
amount and timing of 
 any such 
reduction is 
likely to 
be impacted 
by, 
for example, 
the speed 
at which 
federal assistance 
is distributed 
and the 
financial 
 condition, liquidity 
and cash 
management practices of 
such entities, 
as well 
as on 
the ability 
of BPPR 
to maintain 
these customer 
 relationships. 
 The 
Corporation may 
also have 
direct 
exposure with 
regards to 
avoidance and 
other causes 
of 
action initiated 
by the 
Oversight 
 Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 24 
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 United States Virgin Islands 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
operations 
in 
the 
United 
States 
Virgin 
Islands 
(the 
 USVI 
and 
has 
credit 
exposure 
to 
USVI 
government 
 entities. 
 The USVI has 
been experiencing a 
number of fiscal 
and economic challenges, 
which could adversely 
affect the 
ability of its 
public 
 corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding 
debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI 
and, as such, 
 there 
is 
currently 
no 
federal 
legislation 
permitting 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
debts 
of 
the 
USVI 
and 
its 
public 
corporations 
and 
 instrumentalities. 
 To 
the extent that 
the fiscal condition 
of the USVI 
continues to deteriorate, the 
U.S. Congress or the 
Government of the 
USVI may 
 enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the 
financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a 
stay on creditor 
 remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable 
to the USVI. 

 At December 
31, 2022, 
the Corporation 
had approximately 28 
million in 
direct exposure to 
USVI government 
entities (December 
 31, 2021 - 70 million). 

 British Virgin Islands 
 The Corporation has operations in the British Virgin Islands BVI ), which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
 particularly as 
a reduction 
in the 
tourism activity 
which accounts 
for a 
significant portion 
of its 
economy. 
Although the 
Corporation 
 has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the BVI, at December 31, 2022 it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately 
 214 million comprised of various retail and commercial 
clients, compared to a loan portfolio of 221 million 
at December 31, 2021. 
 U.S. Government 
 As further detailed in Notes 
6 and 7 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the 
Corporation s investment 
 securities 
represented exposure 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Government in 
the 
form 
of 
U.S. Government 
sponsored entities, 
as 
well 
as 
agency 

96 
 mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, 1.6 billion 
of residential mortgages, 38 million of SBA loans under the 
 Paycheck Protection Program PPP and 72 million 
commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by 
the U.S. Government or its 
 agencies at December 31, 2022 (compared 
to 1.6 billion, 353 million and 67 million, 
respectively, at December 31, 2021).
 Non-Performing Assets 
 Non-performing assets NPAs 
include primarily past-due 
loans that 
are no 
longer accruing interest, 
renegotiated loans, and 
real 
 estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality 
metrics, is presented in Table 21. 
 During 2022, the Corporation showed favorable 
credit quality trends with low levels 
of NCOs and decreasing NPLs. We 
continue to 
 closely 
monitor 
changes 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment 
and 
borrower 
performance, 
given 
inflationary 
pressures 
and 
 geopolitical 
uncertainty. 
However, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
improvement 
over 
recent 
years 
in 
the 
risk 
profile 
of 
the 
 Corporation s loan portfolios positions Popular to operate 
successfully under the current environment. 

 Total 
NPAs 
decreased 
by 
 104 
million 
when 
compared 
with 
December 
31, 
2021. 
Total 
non-performing 
loans 
held-in-portfolio 
 NPLs decreased 
by 
 108 million 
from 
December 31, 
2021. BPPR s 
NPLs 
decreased by 
 112 
million, 
mainly 
driven by 
lower 
 mortgage and commercial NPLs by 91 million and 
 38 million, respectively, in 
part offset by higher auto NPLs by 
 18 million. 
The 
 mortgage 
NPLs 
decrease 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
combined 
effects 
of 
collection 
efforts, 
increased foreclosure 
activity 
and 
lower 
 inflows compared 
with pre-pandemic 
trends. 
Popular U.S. 
NPLs increased 
by 4 
million from 
December 31, 
2021, mainly 
in the 
 commercial portfolio, in part due to an 11 million commercial borrower within the healthcare 
industry that was placed in non-accrual 
 status and for which a partial charge-off of 8.7 million was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the 
 ratio of 
NPLs to 
total loans 
held-in-portfolio was 
1.4 compared 
to 1.9 , 
at December 
31, 2021. 
Other real 
estate owned 
loans 
 OREOs increased 
by 4 
million. At 
December 31, 
2022, NPLs 
secured by 
real estate 
amounted to 
 303 million 
in the 
Puerto 
 Rico 
operations and 
 33 million 
in Popular 
U.S. These 
figures were 
 428 million 
and 31 
million, respectively, 
at 
December 31, 
 2021. 
 The Corporation s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate CRE amounted to 9.9 billion at December 31, 
2022, of which 
 3.1 billion was secured 
with owner occupied properties, compared 
with 8.4 billion and 
 1.8 billion, respectively, 
at December 31, 
 2021. During 
the first 
quarter of 
2022, the 
Corporation reclassified 
 0.9 billion 
of loans 
from the 
Commercial Real 
Estate CRE 
 Non-Owner-Occupied category to the CRE Owner-Occupied category. The selected loans are primarily to skilled and assisted 
living 
 nursing homes where the majority 
of the revenues, which are 
the basis for the 
repayment of the loans, are 
generated from medical 
 and 
related 
operational 
activities. 
These 
loans 
meet 
the 
type 
of 
business 
and 
source 
requirements as 
defined 
in 
the 
regulatory 
 guidance 
allowing 
this 
classification. 
CRE 
NPLs 
amounted 
to 
 54 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
compared 
with 
 77 
million 
at 
 December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
CRE 
NPL 
ratios 
for 
the 
BPPR 
and 
Popular 
U.S. 
segments 
were 
1.04 
and 
0.12 , 
respectively, 
at 
 December 31, 2021, compared with 1.95 and 0.04 , 
respectively, at December 31, 2021. 
 In addition to the NPLs included in Table 21, at December 31, 2022, there were 374 million of performing loans, mostly commercial 
 loans, which in management s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2021 
 - 214 million). 
 For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
total 
inflows 
of 
NPLs 
held-in-portfolio, 
excluding 
consumer 
loans, 
decreased 
by 
 approximately 74 million, when compared to the inflows for the 
same period in 2021. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the 
BPPR 
 segment decreased by 76 million compared 
to the same period in 
2021, driven by lower mortgage 
and commercial inflows by 38 
 million each. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at 
the Popular U.S. segment increased by 2 million 
from the same period in 2021.

 [1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale

 [2] It is the Corporation s policy to report delinquent 
residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA as accruing 
loans past due 90 
 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the 
principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans 
includes 14 million at December 31, 
 2022 related to the rebooking of loans previously pooled into 
GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back 
option as further described 
 below (December 31, 2021 - 13 million). Under the GNMA 
program, issuers such as BPPR have the option 
but not the obligation to repurchase loans 
 that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, 
these loans subject to the repurchase option are required 
to be reflected (rebooked) on 
 the financial statements of BPPR with an offsetting 
liability. These balances include 
 190 million of residential mortgage loans insured 
by FHA or 
 guaranteed by the VA that 
are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2022 (December 
31, 2021 - 304 million). 
Furthermore, the Corporation 
 has approximately 42 million in reverse mortgage loans which 
are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing 
interest. 
Due to the 
 guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation's 
policy to exclude these balances from non-performing 
assets (December 31, 2021 - 50 million).

 Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes 0.5 billion of 
residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed

 2021 (December 31, 2020 - 0.6 billion). Refer to Note 
8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information of guaranteed loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses ACL 
 The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 
2020. The allowance for credit losses ACL ), 
 represents management s estimate 
of expected credit 
losses through the 
remaining contractual life 
of the 
different loan segments, 
 impacted by expected 
prepayments. The ACL 
is maintained at 
a sufficient 
level to provide 
for estimated credit 
losses on collateral 
 dependent 
loans 
as 
well 
as 
troubled 
debt 
restructurings 
separately 
from 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
loan 
portfolio. 
The 
Corporation s 
 management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current conditions, 
 macroeconomic 
economic 
expectations 
through 
a 
reasonable 
and 
supportable 
period, 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
portfolio 
 composition by loan type and 
risk characteristics, results of periodic credit 
reviews of individual loans, and 
regulatory requirements, 
 amongst other factors. 
 The Corporation must rely on 
estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where 
the ultimate outcome is unknown, such 
as 
 economic developments affecting specific 
customers, industries, or markets. 
Other factors that can 
affect management s estimates 
 are 
recalibration 
of 
statistical 
models 
used 
to 
calculate 
lifetime 
expected 
losses, 
changes 
in 
underwriting 
standards, 
financial 
 accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, 
among others. Changes in the financial condition 
of individual borrowers, 
 in economic 
conditions, and 
in the 
condition of 
the various 
markets in 
which collateral 
may be 
sold, may 
also affect 
the required 
 level of 
the allowance 
for credit 
losses. Consequently, 
the business 
financial condition, 
liquidity, 
capital, and 
results of 
operations 
 could also be affected. 
 At December 
31, 2022, the 
allowance for credit 
losses amounted to 
 720 million, an 
increase of 25 
million, when compared 
with 
 December 31, 
2021. Given that 
any one economic
 outlook is 
inherently uncertain, the 
Corporation leverages multiple 
scenarios to 
 estimate its ACL. The 
baseline scenario continues to be 
assigned the highest probability, 
followed by the pessimistic scenario. 
The 
 Corporation evaluates, 
at 
least on 
an annual 
basis, the 
assumptions tied 
to the 
CECL accounting 
framework. These 
include the 
 reasonable 
and 
supportable 
period as 
well 
as 
the 
reversion window. 
During the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2022, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
evaluation 
 procedures, the Corporation decided to extend the reversion 
window from 1 year to 3 years. 
The extension in the reversion window 
 results in 
a better 
representation of 
historical movements 
for key 
macroeconomic variables 
that 
impact the 
ACL. This 
change 
in 
 assumptions contributed 
to a 
reduction of 
 11 
million in 
the ACL. 
The reasonable 
and supportable 
period assumptions 
remained 
 unchanged at 2-years. 

102 
 The baseline scenario assumes a 2023 annualized GDP growth for Puerto Rico and the United States of 1.3 and 0.7 . For 2022, 
 annualized expected 
growth was 
2.6 and 
1.8 for 
Puerto Rico 
and United States, 
respectively. 
The reduction 
in 2023 
is due 
to 
 the expected 
slowdown in 
the economy 
as a 
result of 
tight monetary 
policy, 
weaker job 
growth and 
persistent inflation. 
The 2023 
 average unemployment 
rate is 
forecasted at 
7.8 and 
4.0 for 
Puerto Rico 
and 
United States, 
respectively, 
compared to 
2022 
 average levels of 6.4 for Puerto Rico and 3.7 for the United States. In 2023, weaker job growth due to the expected slowdown in 
 the economy will contribute to the increase in unemployment 
rate. 
 The ACL 
for BPPR 
increased by 21 
million to 
 616 million, when 
compared to 
December 31, 2021, 
mostly driven 
by changes 
in 
 the economic scenario, higher loan volumes and changes in credit quality The ACL for Popular U.S. increased by 4 million to 105 
 million, when compared to December 31, 2021. 

 The provision 
for credit 
losses for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
amounted to 
an expense 
of 83.3 
million, compared 
to a 
 benefit 
of 
 183.3 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 31, 
2021, as 
the 
prior 
year 
included 
reductions in 
reserves 
due 
to 
post-
 pandemic improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and lower NCOs. Refer

amounted to 59.3 
million, increasing by 
 38.6 million when 
compared to the 
same 
 period in

BPPR segment 
increased by 
 29.4 million 
mainly driven 
by higher 
consumer NCOs 
by 40.5 
million, mostly 
 auto loans, in part offset by lower mortgage NCOs by 18.5 million. The increase in the consumer NCOs was mostly related to post-

low levels. 
The PB segment NCOs increased by 9.2 million, mainly 
driven 
 by 
higher commercial

2,428 
 loans with 
a 94.8 
million amortized 
cost were 
granted a 
moratorium of 
which 218 
loans with 
a 7.7 
million amortized 
cost have 
 been classified as TDR. 

104 
 TDRs in the BPPR segment amounted to 1.6 billion, 
a decrease of 12 million, mostly related to 
lower consumer TDRs by 11 
 million. The Popular U.S. segment TDRs have remained 
essentially flat since December 31, 2021. TDRs 
in accruing status 
 increased by 26 million from December 31, 2021, 
mostly related to an increase of 26 million 
in BPPR s mortgage TDRs, while 
 non-accruing TDRs decreased by 39 million, mostly related 
to lower mortgage and commercial TDRs by 26 
million and 10 
 million, respectively. 

 Refer to 
Note 9 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for

 Enterprise Risk Management 
 The Corporation s 
Board of 
Directors has 
established a 
Risk Management 
Committee RMC 
to, among 
other things, 
assist the 
 Board in its (i) oversight of the Corporation s overall risk framework and (ii) 
to monitor, review, and approve policies to measure, limit 
 and manage the Corporation s risks. 

 The 
Corporation 
has 
established 
a 
three 
lines 
of 
defense 
framework: 
(a) 
business 
line 
management constitutes 
the 
first 
line 
of 
 defense by identifying 
and managing the 
risks associated with 
business activities, (b) components 
of the Risk 
Management Group 
 and 
the 
Corporate 
Security 
Group, 
among 
others, 
act 
as 
the 
second 
line 
of 
defense 
by, 
among 
other 
things, 
measuring 
and 
 reporting on the Corporation s risk activities, and (c) the Corporate Auditing Division
 ,
 
as the third line of defense, reporting directly to 
 the Audit Committee of the Board, by independently providing 
assurance regarding the effectiveness of the risk 
framework. 

 The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the ERM Committee is a management committee 
whose purpose is to: (a) monitor 
 the 
principal risks 
as defined 
in the 
Risk Appetite 
Statement RAS 
of the 
Risk Management 
Policy 
affecting our 
business and 
 within the Corporation s Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework, 
(b) review key risk indicators and related developments 
at 
 the 
business 
level 
consistent 
with 
the 
RAS, 
and 
(c) 
lead 
the 
incorporation 
of 
a 
uniform 
Governance, 
Risk 
and 
Compliance 
 framework 
across the 
Corporation. The 
ERM 
Committee 
and the 
Enterprise 
Risk Management 
Department in 
the 
Financial and 
 Operational Risk Management 
Division (the 
 FORM Division ), in 
coordination with the 
Chief Risk 
Officer, create 
the framework to 
 identify and 
manage multiple 
and cross-enterprise 
risks, and 
to articulate 
the RAS 
and supporting 
metrics.
 Our risk 
management 
 program 
monitors 
the 
following 
principal 
risks: 
credit, 
interest 
rate, 
market, 
liquidity, 
operational, cyber 
and 
information 
security, 
 climate, legal, regulatory affairs, regulatory and financial 
compliance, BSA/ AML sanctions, strategic and 
reputational. 
 The 
Enterprise 
Risk 
Management 
Department 
has 
established 
a 
process 
to 
ensure 
that 
an 
appropriate 
standard 
readiness 
 assessment is performed before we launch a new 
product or service. Similar procedures are followed with the Treasury 
Division for 
 transactions involving the purchase and sale of 
assets, and by the Mergers and Acquisitions Division 
for acquisition transactions. 
 The Asset/Liability 
Committee ALCO ), 
composed of 
senior management 
representatives from 
the business 
lines and 
corporate 
 functions, and the Corporate Finance Group, are responsible for planning and executing the 
Corporation s market, interest rate risk, 
 funding 
activities 
and 
strategy, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
implementing 
approved 
policies 
and 
procedures. 
The 
ALCO 
also 
reviews 
the 
 Corporation s 
capital 
policy 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
capital 
management 
objectives. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Financial 
Risk, 
Corporate 
 Insurance Advisory 
Department independently 
measures, monitors 
and reports 
compliance with 
liquidity and 
market risk 
policies, 
 and oversees controls surrounding interest risk measurements. 
 The Corporate Compliance 
Committee, comprised of 
senior management team 
members and representatives 
from the Regulatory 
 and Financial 
Compliance Division 
and the 
Financial Crimes 
Compliance Division, 
among others, 
are responsible 
for overseeing 
 and 
assessing 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
risk 
management 
processes 
that 
underlie 
Popular s 
compliance 
program 
for 
identifying, 
 assessing, 
measuring, 
monitoring, 
testing, 
mitigating, 
and 
reporting 
compliance 
risks. 
They 
also 
supervise 
Popular s 
reporting 
 obligations under the compliance program so as to ensure the adequacy, consistency and timeliness of the reporting of compliance-
 related risks across the Corporation. 

 The Regulatory Affairs 
team is 
responsible for maintaining 
an open dialog 
with the banking 
regulatory agencies in 
order to 
ensure 
 regulatory 
risks 
are 
properly identified, 
measured, 
monitored, 
as 
well 
as 
communicated to 
the 
appropriate regulatory 
agency 
as 
 necessary to keep them apprised of material matters within 
the purview of these agencies.

105 
 The 
Credit 
Strategy 
Committee,

of 
senior 
level 
management 
representatives 
from 
the 
business 
lines 
and 
corporate 
 functions, 
and 
the 
Corporate 
Credit 
Risk 
Management 
Division, 
are 
responsible 
for 
managing 
the 
Corporation s 
overall 
credit 
 exposure by establishing policies, standards and guidelines that define, quantify and monitor credit risk and assessing 
the adequacy 
 of the allowance for credit losses. 

 The Corporation s 
Operational Risk 
Committee ORCO 
and the 
Cyber Security 
Committee, which are 
composed of 
senior level 
 management representatives from 
the business lines 
and corporate functions, 
provide executive oversight 
to facilitate 
consistency 
 of effective 
policies, best practices, 
controls and 
monitoring tools for 
managing and 
assessing all types 
of operational 
risks across 
 the Corporation. The 
FORM Division, within 
the Risk Management Group, 
serves as ORCO s 
operating arm and 
is responsible for 
 establishing baseline processes to measure, monitor, limit and manage 
operational risk. 

The Corporate Security Group CSG ), under the direction of the 
Chief Security Officer, leads 
all efforts pertaining to cybersecurity, 
 enterprise fraud and data 
privacy, including 
developing strategies and oversight processes with 
policies and programs that mitigate 
 compliance, operational, 
strategic, financial 
and reputational 
risks associated 
with the 
Corporation s and 
our customers 
data and 
 assets. 
The CSG also leads the Cyber Security Committee. 
 The Corporate Legal Division, in this context, has the responsibility 
of assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting with respect 
to 
 legal risks, including those related to litigation, investigations 
and other material legal matters. 

 The Corporation 
has also 
established an 
ESG Committee 
whose purpose 
and responsibility 
is to 
oversee the 
Corporation s ESG 
 strategies and 
support the 
development and 
consistent application 
of policies, 
processes and 
procedures that 
measure, limit 
and 
 manage ESG 
matters and 
risks. The ESG 
Committee also assesses 
ESG-related considerations in 
the credit 
approval process of 
 commercial credit applications. 
 The processes 
of strategic 
risk planning 
and the 
evaluation of 
reputational risk 
are on-going 
processes through 
which continuous 
 data gathering and 
analysis are performed. 
In order 
to ensure strategic 
risks are properly 
identified and monitored, 
the Corporate 
 Strategy and 
Transformation Division, 
which reports to 
the Corporation s 
Chief Operations Officer, 
performs periodic assessments 
 regarding corporate 
strategic priority 
initiatives, such as 
the Corporation s 
transformation initiative 
and other 
emerging issues. 
The 
 Acquisitions 
and 
Corporate 
Investments 
Division 
continuously 
assesses 
potential 
strategic 
transactions. 
The 
Corporate 
 Communications 
Division 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
monitoring, 
management 
and 
implementation 
of 
action 
plans 
with 
respect 
to 
 reputational risk issues. 

 Popular s capital planning process integrates the Corporation s risk profile 
as well as its strategic focus, operating 
environment, and 
 other factors 
that could 
materially affect 
capital adequacy 
in hypothetical 
highly-stressed business 
scenarios. Capital 
ratio targets 
 and triggers take into consideration the different risks evaluated 
under Popular s risk management framework. 
 In 
addition to 
establishing a 
formal process 
to manage 
risk, our 
corporate culture 
is also 
critical to 
an effective 
risk management 
 function. 
Through our Code 
of Ethics, the 
Corporation provides a framework 
for all our 
employees to conduct themselves 
with the 
 highest integrity.

 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting 
 The management of 
Popular, Inc. 
(the Corporation is responsible 
for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control 
over 
 financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 
15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for our assessment 
 of internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation s internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
 reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
 in 
accordance 
with 
accounting 
principles 
generally 
accepted 
in 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
and 
includes 
controls 
over 
the 
 preparation of 
financial statements 
in accordance 
with the 
instructions to 
the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
for Bank 
Holding 
 Companies (Form FR Y-9C) 
to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 112 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 Improvement Act (FDICIA). The Corporation s internal control 
over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that: 
 (i) 
pertain 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
records 
that, 
in 
reasonable 
detail, 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect 
the 
transactions 
and 
 dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; 
 (ii) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that 
transactions 
are 
recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
preparation 
of 
financial 
 statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts 
 and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors 
 of the Corporation; and 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition 
 of the Corporation s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements. 
 Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
misstatements. 
Also, 
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
 of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The management of Popular, 
Inc. has assessed the 
effectiveness of the Corporation s 
internal control over financial reporting 
as of 
 December 
31, 
2022. 
In 
making 
this 
assessment, 
management 
used 
the 
criteria 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Internal 
Control-Integrated 
 Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 
 as of December 31, 2022 based on the 
criteria referred to above. 
 The Corporation s 
independent registered 
public accounting 
firm, 
 
 , 
has audited 
the effectiveness 
of 
 the Corporation s 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
as stated 
in their 
report dated 
March 1, 
2023

audited 
the 
accompanying 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
financial 
condition 
of 
Popular, 
Inc. 
and 
its 
 subsidiaries 
(the 
 Corporation 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
and 
the 
related 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
 operations, comprehensive (loss) income, 
changes in stockholders equity 
and cash flows for 
each of the three 
years 
 in 
the 
period 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
including 
the 
related 
notes 
(collectively 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
 consolidated 
 financial 
statements ). 
We 
also 
have 
audited 
the 
Corporation's 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as 
of 
 December 
31, 2022, 
based on 
criteria 
established in 
Internal Control 
- Integrated 
Framework (2013) 
issued 
by the 
 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 In 
our 
opinion, 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
referred 
to 
above 
present 
fairly, 
in 
all 
material 
respects, 
the 
 financial position of the Corporation as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the 
results of its operations and its cash 
 flows 
for 
each 
of 
the 
three 
years 
in 
the 
period 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
in 
conformity with 
accounting 
principles 
 generally accepted 
in the 
United States 
of America. 
Also, in 
our opinion, 
the Corporation 
maintained, in 
all material 
 respects, effective 
internal control over 
financial reporting as 
of December 31, 
2022, based on 
criteria established 
in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As 
discussed 
in 
Note 
3
 to 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, 
the 
Corporation 
changed 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
it 
 accounts for its allowance for credit losses in 2020. 
 Basis for Opinions 

 The 
Corporation's management 
is responsible 
for these 
consolidated 
financial statements, 
for maintaining 
effective 
 internal control 
over financial 
reporting, and 
for its 
assessment of 
the effectiveness 
of internal 
control over 
financial 
 reporting, 
included 
in 
the 
accompanying 
Report 
of 
Management 
on 
Internal 
Control 
over 
Financial 
Reporting. 
Our 
 responsibility is 
to express opinions 
on the 
Corporation s consolidated 
financial statements and 
on the 
Corporation s 
 internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
based 
on 
our 
audits. 
We 
are 
a 
public 
accounting 
firm 
registered 
with 
the 
 Public 
Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
Board 
(United 
States) 
(PCAOB) 
and 
are 
required 
to 
be 
independent 
with 
 respect 
to 
the 
Corporation 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws 
and 
the 
applicable 
rules 
and 
 regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits 
in accordance with the standards 
of the PCAOB. Those standards 
require that we plan and 
 perform 
the audits 
to obtain 
reasonable assurance 
about 
whether the 
consolidated financial 
statements are 
free of 
 material 
misstatement, 
whether due 
to error 
or 
fraud, and 
whether 
effective 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting 
 was maintained in all material respects. 

 Our 
audits 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
included 
performing 
procedures 
to 
assess 
the 
risks of 
material 
 misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements, whether due 
to error or fraud, 
and performing procedures that 
 respond to 
those risks. 
Such procedures 
included examining, 
on a 
test basis, 
evidence regarding 
the amounts 
and 
 disclosures 
in 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
Our 
audits 
also 
included 
evaluating 
the 
accounting 
principles 
 used 
and 
significant 
estimates 
made 
by 
management, 
as 
well 
as 
evaluating 
the 
overall 
presentation 
of 
the 
 consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
Our 
audit 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
included 
obtaining 
an 

111 
 understanding 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
assessing 
the 
risk 
that 
a 
material 
weakness 
exists, 
and 
 testing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
based 
on 
the 
assessed 
risk. 
Our 
 audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in 
the circumstances. We believe 
 that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 A 
company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
 regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
for 
external 
purposes 
in 
 accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles. 
Management's 
assessment 
and 
our 
audit 
of 
Popular, 
 Inc.'s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
also 
included 
controls 
over 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
 accordance with the instructions 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for Bank Holding Companies 
(Form FR Y-
 9C) 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
reporting 
requirements 
of 
Section 
112 
of 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation 
 Improvement 
Act 
(FDICIA). 
A 
company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
 procedures 
that (i) 
pertain to 
the maintenance 
of records 
that, in 
reasonable detail, 
accurately 
and fairly 
reflect the 
 transactions and 
dispositions of 
the assets 
of the 
company; (ii) 
provide reasonable 
assurance that 
transactions are 
 recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
 accounting 
principles, and 
that receipts 
and expenditures 
of the 
company are 
being made 
only 
in accordance 
with 
 authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
company; 
and 
(iii) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have 
 a material effect on the financial statements. 

 Because of 
its inherent 
limitations, internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
may not 
prevent or 
detect misstatements. 
 Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are 
subject to the risk 
that controls may become 
 inadequate because 
of changes 
in conditions, 
or that 
the degree 
of compliance 
with the 
policies or 
procedures may 
 deteriorate. 

 Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical 
audit matters 
communicated below 
are matters 
arising from 
the current 
period audit 
of the 
consolidated 
 financial 
statements 
that 
were 
communicated 
or 
required 
to 
be 
communicated 
to 
the 
audit 
committee 
and 
that 
(i) 
 relate 
to 
accounts 
or 
disclosures 
that 
are 
material 
to 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
and 
(ii) 
involved 
our 
 especially challenging, 
subjective, or 
complex judgments. 
The communication 
of critical 
audit matters 
does not 
alter 
 in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and 
we are not, by communicating 
 the 
critical 
audit 
matters 
below, 
providing 
separate 
opinions 
on 
the 
critical 
audit 
matters 
or 
on 
the 
accounts 
or 
 disclosures to which they relate. 

 Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses 
on 
Loans 
Held-in-Portfolio 
- 
Quantitative 
Models, 
and 
Qualitative 
Adjustments 
to 
the 
 Puerto Rico Portfolios 

 As described in 
Notes 2 and 
9 to the 
consolidated financial statements, 
the Corporation follows 
the current expected 
 credit 
loss CECL 
model, 
to 
establish 
and 
evaluate 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses ACL 
to 
 provide for expected 
losses in the loan 
portfolio. As of December 
31, 2022, the allowance 
for credit losses 
was 720 
 million 
on 
total 
loans 
of 
 32 
billion. 
This 
CECL 
model 
establishes 
a 
forward-looking 
methodology 
that 
reflects 
the 
 expected credit losses over the lives of financial assets. The quantitative modeling framework includes competing risk 
 models 
to 
generate 
lifetime 
defaults 
and 
prepayments, 
and 
other 
loan 
level 
modeling 
techniques 
to 
estimate 
loss 
 severity. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
methodology, 
management 
evaluates 
various 
macroeconomic 
scenarios, 
and 
may 
apply 
 probability 
weights 
to 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
selected 
scenarios. 
The 
ACL 
also 
includes 
a 
qualitative 
framework 
that 
 addresses losses 
that are 
expected but 
not captured 
within the 
quantitative modeling 
framework. In 
order to 
identify 
 potential 
losses 
that are 
not captured 
through the 
models, management 
evaluated model 
limitations as 
well as 
the 
 different 
risks covered 
by the 
variables used 
in each 
quantitative model. 
To 
complement the 
analysis, management 
 also evaluated 
sectors that 
have low 
levels of 
historical defaults, 
but current 
conditions show 
the potential 
for future 
 losses. 

112 
 The 
principal 
considerations 
for 
our 
determination 
that 
performing 
procedures 
relating 
to 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
 losses on 
loans 
held-in-portfolio quantitative 
models, and 
qualitative adjustments 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
portfolios is 
a 
 critical 
audit 
matter 
are 
(i) 
the 
significant 
judgment 
by 
management 
in 
determining 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses, 
 including 
qualitative adjustments 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
portfolios, 
which in 
turn led 
to a 
high degree 
of auditor 
effort, 
 judgment, and subjectivity in performing 
procedures and evaluating audit evidence 
relating to the allowance for 
credit 
 losses, 
including management s 
selection of 
macroeconomic 
scenarios and 
probability weights 
applied; and 
(ii) the 
 audit 
effort 
involved the 
use of 
professionals with 
specialized skill 
and knowledge. 
Addressing 
the matter 
involved 
 performing 
procedures 
and 
evaluating 
audit 
evidence 
in 
connection 
with 
forming 
our 
overall 
opinion 
on 
the 
 consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
These 
procedures 
included 
testing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
controls 
relating 
to 
the 
 allowance for 
credit losses 
for loans 
held-in-portfolio, including 
qualitative adjustments 
to the 
Puerto Rico 
portfolios. 
 These procedures also included, among others, testing management s 
process for estimating the allowance for credit 
 losses 
by (i) 
evaluating the 
appropriateness of 
the methodology, 
including models 
used for 
estimating the 
ACL; (ii) 
 evaluating 
the reasonableness of management s 
selection of various macroeconomic 
scenarios including probability 
 weights 
applied 
to 
the 
expected 
loss 
outcome 
of 
the 
selected 
macroeconomic 
scenarios; 
(iii) 
evaluating 
the 
 reasonableness of 
the qualitative 
adjustments to 
Puerto Rico 
portfolios allowance 
for credit 
losses; 
and (iv) 
testing 
 the 
data 
used 
in 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses. 
Professionals 
with 
specialized 
skill 
and 
knowledge 
were 
used 
to 
 assist 
in 
evaluating 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
methodology 
and 
models, 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
management s 
 selection 
and 
weighting 
of 
macroeconomic 
scenarios 
used 
to 
estimate 
current 
expected 
credit 
losses 
and 
 reasonableness of the 
qualitative adjustments to Puerto Rico portfolios allowance for credit losses. 

 Goodwill Annual Impairment Assessment - Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular Bank Reporting Units 
 As 
described 
in 
Note 
15 
to 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, 
the 
Corporation s 
consolidated 
goodwill 
balance 
 was 827 million as of December 31, 2022, of which a significant 
portion relates to the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
 BPPR and 
Popular Bank PB reporting 
units. Management 
conducts an 
impairment test 
as of 
July 31 
of each 
 year 
and 
on 
a 
more 
frequent 
basis 
if 
events 
or 
circumstances 
indicate 
an 
impairment 
could 
have 
taken 
place. 
In 
 determining 
the 
fair 
value 
of each 
reporting 
unit, 
management 
generally 
uses 
a 
combination 
of 
methods, 
including 
 market 
price 
multiples 
of 
comparable 
companies 
and 
transactions, 
as 
well 
as 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
analysis. 
 Management evaluates the particular circumstances of 
each reporting unit in order to determine 
the most appropriate 
 valuation 
methodology 
and 
the 
weights 
applied 
to 
each 
valuation 
methodology, 
as 
applicable. 
The 
computations 
 require 
management 
to 
make 
estimates, 
assumptions 
and 
calculations 
related 
to: 
(i) 
a 
selection 
of 
comparable 
 publicly 
traded 
companies, 
based 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
business, 
location 
and 
size; 
(ii) 
a 
selection 
of 
comparable 
 acquisitions, (iii) 
calculation of average price multiples 
of relevant value drivers from 
a group of selected 
comparable 
 companies 
and 
acquisitions; 
(iv) 
the 
discount 
rate 
applied 
to 
future 
earnings, 
based 
on 
an 
estimate 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
 equity; 
(v) 
the 
potential 
future 
earnings 
of 
the 
reporting 
units; 
and 
(vi) 
the 
market 
growth 
and 
new 
business 
 assumptions. 
Furthermore, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
analyses, 
management 
performed 
a 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
aggregate 
fair 
 values determined for 
the reporting units 
to the market 
capitalization of the 
Corporation concluding that 
the fair value 
 results determined for the reporting units were reasonable. 

 The principal 
considerations for our 
determination that performing 
procedures relating to 
goodwill annual 
impairment 
 assessments of 
the Banco 
Popular de 
Puerto Rico 
and Popular 
Bank reporting 
units is 
a critical 
audit matter 
are (i) 
 the significant judgment by 
management when determining the 
fair value measurements of 
the reporting units, which 
 in 
turn 
led 
to 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
auditor 
judgment, 
subjectivity, 
and 
effort 
in 
performing 
procedures 
and 
evaluating 
 evidence 
relating 
to 
the 
calculation 
of 
average 
price 
multiples 
of 
relevant 
value 
drivers 
from 
a 
group 
of 
selected 
 comparable 
companies 
and 
acquisitions; 
the 
potential 
future 
earnings 
of 
the 
reporting 
unit; 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
 equity; 
and 
the 
market 
growth 
and 
new 
business 
assumptions; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
audit 
effort 
involved 
the 
use 
of 
 professionals 
with 
specialized 
skill 
and 
knowledge. 
Addressing 
the 
matter 
involved 
performing 
procedures 
and 
 evaluating 
audit 
evidence 
in 
connection 
with 
forming 
our 
overall 
opinion 
on 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
 These 
procedures 
included 
testing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
controls 
relating 
to 
management s 
goodwill 
impairment 
 assessment 
process, 
including 
controls 
over 
the 
valuation 
of 
Banco 
Popular 
de 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
Popular 
Bank 
 reporting units. These procedures 
also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for determining the 
 fair 
value 
estimates 
of 
Banco 
Popular 
de 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
Popular 
Bank 
reporting 
units; 
(ii) 
evaluating 
the 
 appropriateness of 
the discounted cash 
flow analyses and 
guideline public companies 
methodologies including 
the 
 weights applied 
to each 
valuation method; 
(iii) testing 
the underlying 
data used 
in the 
estimates; 
(iv) evaluating 
the 

113 
 appropriateness 
of 
the 
calculation 
of 
average 
price 
multiples 
of 
relevant 
value 
drivers 
from 
a 
group 
of 
selected 
 comparable 
companies 
and acquisitions; 
and (v) 
evaluating the 
potential 
future 
earnings of 
the 
reporting 
units; 
the 

 estimated cost 
of equity; 
and the market 
growth and 
new business 
assumptions, including 
whether the 
assumptions 
 used 
by 
management 
were 
reasonable 
considering, 
as 
applicable, 
(i) 
the 
current 
and 
past 
performance 
of 
the 
 reporting units; 
(ii) the 
consistency with 
external market and 
industry data; 
and (iii) whether 
these assumptions 
were 
 consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 
Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were 
 used 
to 
assist 
in 
evaluating 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
methods 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
certain 
significant 
 assumptions.

 million, and 
a decrease 
of 

million in 
the allowance 
for credit 
losses for 
unfunded commitments 
and credit 
recourse guarantees 
 which is 
recorded in Other 
Liabilities. The Corporation 
also recognized an 
allowance for credit 
losses of 
approximately 

million 
 related 
to 
its 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
securities 
portfolio. 
The 
adoption 
of 
CECL 
was 
recognized 
under 
the 
modified 
retrospective 
 approach. Therefore, the 
adjustments to record 
the increase 
in the 
allowance for credit 
losses was 
recorded as 
a decrease to 
the 
 opening 
balance 
of 
retained 
earnings 
of 
the 
year 
of 
implementation, 
net 
of 
income 
taxes, 
except 
for 
approximately 

million 
 related to loans 
previously accounted under ASC 
Subtopic 310-30, which 
resulted in a 
reclassification between certain contra 
loan 
 balance 
accounts to 
the 
allowance for 
credit 
losses. The 
total 
impact to 
retained earnings, 
net of 
tax, 
related to 
the adoption 
of 
 CECL 
was of 

million. As 
part 
of 
the adoption 
of 
CECL, the 
Corporation made 
the election 
to 
break the 
existing pools 
of 
 purchased credit impaired PCI loans and, as 
such, these loans are no longer excluded 
from non-performing status.

shares of Evertec common 
 stock valued at closing at 

million (based on Evertec s stock price on June 30, 2022 of 
). A total of 

million of the 
 consideration for 
the transaction 
was attributed 
to the 
acquisition of 
the critical 
channels of 
which 

million were 
attributed to 
 Software 
Intangible 
Assets 
and 

million 
were 
attributed 
to 
goodwill. 
The 
transaction 
was 
accounted 
for 
as 
a 
business 
 combination. 
The 
remaining 

million 
was 
attributed 
to 
the 
renegotiation of 
the 
MSA 
with 
Evertec 
and 
was 
recorded 
as 
an 
 expense. The Corporation also recorded a credit of 

million in Evertec billings under the MSA during the third quarter of 2022 as 
 a result of the Business Acquisition Transaction, resulting in a net 
expense charge of 

million. 
 On 
August 
15, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
completed 
the 
sale 
of 
its 
remaining 

shares 
of 
common 
stock 
of 
Evertec 
(the 
 Evertec Stock Sale , and collectively 
with the Business Acquisition Transaction, 
the Evertec Transactions ). Following 
the Evertec 
 Stock 
Sale, Popular 
no longer 
owns any 
Evertec common 
stock. The 
impact of 
the 
gain on 
the sale 
of 
Evertec shares 
used as 
 consideration 
for 
the 
Business 
Acquisition 
Transaction 
in 
exchange 
for 
the 
acquired 
applications 
on 
July 
1, 
2022 
and 
the 
net 
 expense associated with the renegotiation of the MSA, together with the Evertec Stock Sale and the related accounting adjustments 
 of the Evertec Transactions, resulted in an aggregate after-tax gain 
of 

million, recorded during the third quarter of 2022.

 Goodwill 
 The goodwill 
is the 
residual difference 
between the consideration 
transferred to 
Evertec and 
the fair 
value of 
the assets 
acquired, 
 net of 
the liabilities assumed, 
if any. 
The entire amount 
of goodwill is 
deductible for income 
tax purposes pursuant 
to P.R. 
Internal 
 Revenue Code IRC section 1033.07 over a 
 
 -year period. 
 The Corporation believes 
that given the 
amount of assets 
acquired and the 
size of 
the operations acquired 
in relation to 
Popular s 
 operations, the historical results of Evertec are not 
material to Popular s results, and thus 
no pro forma information is presented.

million in commercial direct financing leases and 

million in working capital lines. 

 Specializing in the healthcare industry, 
the Acquired Business provided a 
variety of lease products, including 
operating and finance 
 leases, 
and 
also 
offers 
private 
label 
vendor 
finance 
programs 
to 
equipment 
manufacturers 
and 
healthcare 
organizations. 
The 
 acquisition provides PB with a national equipment 
leasing platform that complements its existing health 
care lending business.

 -year period. 

 During the third 
quarter of 2022, 
the Corporation revised 
its projected earnings 
related to this 
Acquired Business, and 
accordingly, 
 recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 

million. 

 Contingent consideration 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration, which related to approximately 

million in earnout payments that could be payable 
 to K2 over a three-year period, was calculated based 
on a Montecarlo Simulation model. 

 During the 
third quarter 
of 2022, 
the Corporation 
updated its 
estimates related 
to the 
ability to 
realize the 
earnings targets 
for the 
 contingent payment, and accordingly, recorded a positive adjustment of 

million related this liability. 
 The Corporation believes that given the 
amount of assets and liabilities assumed 
and the size of the operations 
acquired in relation 
 to 
Popular s operations, 
the 
historical results 
of 
K2 
are 
not significant 
to 
Popular s results, 
and thus 
no 
pro 
forma 
information is 
 presented.

December 31,

as 
other highly

are 
used to

 At

The restricted 
assets held 
in 
 debt securities available for

consist primarily of assets

billion, driven mainly by fixed-rate U.S. Treasury Securities and mortgage-backed securities, 
which have been impacted by a decline 
 in fair value as 
a result of the 
rising interest rate environment. 
The portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities is 
comprised mainly 
 of 
U.S 
Treasuries 
and 
obligations 
from 
the 
U.S. 
Government, 
its 
agencies 
or 
government 
sponsored 
entities, 
including 
FNMA, 
 FHMLC and GNMA. 
As discussed in 
Note 2 to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, these securities 
carry an 
explicit or implicit 
 guarantee 
from 
the 
U.S. 
Government, 
are 
highly 
rated 
by 
major 
rating 
agencies, 
and 
have 
a 
long 
history 
of 
no 
credit 
losses. 
 Accordingly, the Corporation applies a zero-credit loss assumption and no ACL for 
these securities has been established. 

 In October 2022, the 
Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury securities 
with a fair value 
of 

billion (par value of 

billion) from 
 its available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. 
Management changed its intent, given its ability to hold these securities 
 to maturity 
due to 
the Corporation s 
liquidity position 
and its 
intention to 
reduce the 
impact on 
accumulated other 
comprehensive 
 income (loss) AOCI and 
tangible capital of further 
increases in interest rates. 
The securities were reclassified 
at fair value at 
the 
 time of 
the transfer. 
At the 
date of 
the transfer, 
these securities 
had pre-tax 
unrealized losses of 

million recorded 
in AOCI. 
 This fair value discount is being accreted to interest income and the unrealized loss remaining in AOCI is being amortized, offsetting 
 each other through the remaining life of the securities. 
There were no realized gains or losses recorded 
as a result of this transfer.

In

the full 
faith, credit 
and unlimited 
taxing power 
of the 
issuing municipality, 
which is 
 required by law to levy property taxes in an amount sufficient for the payment of 
debt service on such general obligation bonds. The 
 Corporation performs periodic credit quality 
reviews of these securities and 
internally assigns standardized credit risk ratings based 
 on its evaluation. 
The Corporation considers these ratings 
in its estimate to 
develop the allowance for credit 
losses associated with 
 these 
securities.

 The Corporation has 
designated loans classified as 
collateral dependent for 
which the ACL 
is measured based 
on the fair 
value of 
 the collateral less 
cost to sell, 
when foreclosure is 
probable or when 
the repayment is 
expected to be 
provided substantially by the 
 sale or 
operation of 
the collateral 
and the 
borrower is 
experiencing financial 
difficulty. 
The fair 
value of 
the collateral 
is based 
on 
 appraisals, which may be 
adjusted due to their 
age, and the 
type, location, and condition 
of the property 
or area or general 
market 
 conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date 
of the appraisal and the measurement date. Appraisals 
 are updated every one to two years depending on 
the type of loan and the total exposure of 
the borrower. 
 The following tables present the amortized cost basis 
of collateral-dependent loans, for which the ACL was measured 
based on the 
 fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, by class 
of loans and type of collateral as of December

results 
in

of 
historical 
 movements for 
key macroeconomic 
variables that 
impact the 
ACL. This 
change in 
assumptions contributed 
to a 
reduction of

period assumptions remained unchanged at 2- 
years. 
 The baseline scenario assumes a 2023 annualized 
GDP growth for Puerto Rico and 
the United States of 1.3 and 
0.7 . For 2022 
 annualized expected growth 
was 2.6 and 
1.8 for Puerto 
Rico and United 
States, respectively. 
The reduction in 
2023 is due 
to 
 the expected slowdown in the economy as a 
result of tight monetary policy, weaker job growth and persistent inflation. 
 The 2023 average unemployment rate is forecasted at 7.8 and 4.0 for Puerto Rico and United States, respectively, compared to 
 2022 average level 6.4 for Puerto Rico and 3.7 for the United States. In 2023, weaker job growth due to the expected slowdown 
 in the economy will contribute to an increase 
in the unemployment rate.

 The Corporation has offered to clients impacted by the hurricanes Fiona 
a moratorium of up to three monthly payments on personal 
 and commercial credit cards, auto loans, leases, and personal loans, 
subject to certain eligibility requirements. Mortgage clients also 
 benefited from 
different 
payment relief 
alternatives available, 
depending on 
their type 
of 
loan. Loan 
relief options 
for commercial 
 clients were reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. As of December 31, 
2022, approximately 2,428 loans with 
a 94.8 loans amortized 
 cost were granted a moratorium of which 218

 The Corporation, from time to time, repurchases delinquent 
loans from its GNMA servicing portfolio, in compliance 
with Guarantor guidelines, and 
 may incur in losses related to previously advanced interest 
on delinquent loans. During the quarter ended September 
30, 2020 the Corporation 
 repurchased 

million of GNMA loans and recorded a loss of 

million for previously advanced interest on delinquent 
loans. Effective for 
 the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Corporation 
has determined to present these losses as part of its 
Mortgage Banking Activities, which 
 were previously presented within the indemnity reserves on loans 
sold component of non-interest income.

180 

liabilities were incurred 
as a result 
of these securitizations 
during the years 
ended December 31, 2022 
and 2021 because 
they 
 did 
not 
contain 
any 
credit 
recourse 
arrangements. 
The 
Corporation recorded 
a 
net 
loss 
of 

million 
and 
a 
net 
gain 
of 

million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021

million (2021 - 
 
 million). All loan sales performed during the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were without 
credit recourse agreements. 

 The Corporation recognizes as assets the rights to service loans for others, 
whether these rights are purchased or result from asset 
 transfers such as sales and securitizations. These mortgage 
servicing rights MSRs are measured at fair value. 
 The 
Corporation 
uses 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model 
to 
estimate 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
MSRs. 
The 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model 
 incorporates 
assumptions 
that 
market 
participants 
would 
use 
in 
estimating 
future 
net 
servicing 
income, 
including 
estimates 
of 
 prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, prepayment and late 
 fees, among other considerations. Prepayment speeds are 
adjusted for the loans characteristics and portfolio behavior. 

 The following table 
presents the changes 
in MSRs measured 
using the fair 
value method for 
the years ended 
December 31, 2022 
 and 2021.

billion at December 31, 2022 (2021 -

 Net mortgage servicing fees, a component of mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, include the 
 changes from period to period in the fair value of the MSRs, including changes due to collection / realization of expected cash flows. 
 The banking 
subsidiaries receive servicing 
fees based 
on a 
percentage of the 
outstanding loan balance. 
These servicing fees 
are 
 credited to 
income when they 
are collected. At 
December 31, 
2022, those 
weighted average mortgage 
servicing fees 
were 

(2021 
). Under these 
servicing agreements, the 
banking subsidiaries do 
not generally earn 
significant prepayment penalty 
 fees on the underlying loans serviced. 
 The section 
below includes 
information on 
assumptions used 
in the 
valuation model 
of the 
MSRs, originated 
and purchased. 
Key 
 economic assumptions used 
in measuring the 
servicing rights derived 
from loans securitized 
or sold by 
the Corporation during 
the 
 years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 
as follows:

At December 31, 2022, the Corporation serviced 

billion (2021 - 

billion) in residential mortgage loans with credit recourse 
to 
 the Corporation, from which 

million was 60 days or 
more past due (2021 - 

million). Also refer to Note 
23 for information on 
 changes in the Corporation s liability of estimated losses 
related to loans serviced with credit recourse. 
 Under the GNMA 
securitizations, the Corporation, as 
servicer, has 
the right to 
repurchase (but not the 
obligation), at its 
option and 
 without 
GNMA s 
prior 
authorization, 
any 
loan 
that 
is 
collateral 
for 
a 
GNMA 
guaranteed 
mortgage-backed 
security 
when 
certain 
 delinquency 
criteria 
are 
met. 
At 
the 
time 
that 
individual 
loans 
meet 
GNMA s 
specified 
delinquency 
criteria 
and 
are 
eligible 
for 
 repurchase, the Corporation is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans if the Corporation was the pool issuer. At 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
recorded 

million 
in 
mortgage 
loans 
on 
its 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Financial 
 Condition related to this 
buy-back option program (2021 - 

million). Loans in 
our serviced GNMA portfolio 
benefit from payment 
 forbearance programs but continue to reflect the contractual delinquency until 
the borrower repays deferred payments or completes 
 a payment deferral modification 
or other borrower assistance 
alternative. As long as 
the Corporation continues to service 
the loans 
 that continue to be collateral in a GNMA guaranteed 
mortgage-backed security, the MSR is recognized by the Corporation. 

 During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
repurchased 
approximately 

million 
of 
mortgage 
loans 
from 
its 
 GNMA servicing portfolio (2021 - 

million). The determination to repurchase these loans 
was based on the economic benefits 
of 
 the transaction, which results in a reduction of the servicing costs for 
these severely delinquent loans, mostly related to principal and 
 interest advances. The 
risk associated with 
the loans is 
reduced due to 
their guaranteed nature. 
The Corporation may place 
these 
 loans under modification 
programs offered by 
FHA, VA 
or United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
or other loss 
mitigation 
 programs offered by the Corporation, and once brought back to 
current status, these may be either retained in portfolio or re-sold 
in 
 the secondary market.

of reasonability given 
 the current market conditions. 
 The results of the BPPR annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2022 
indicated that the average estimated fair value using all 
 valuation methodologies exceeded BPPR s equity 
value by approximately 

billion or 
 
 compared to 

billion or 
 
 , for 
 the annual 
goodwill impairment test 
completed as 
of July 
31, 2021. PB s 
annual goodwill impairment 
test results 
as of 
such dates 
 indicated that the average estimated fair value using all valuation methodologies exceeded PB s equity value by approximately 
 
 million 
or 
 
 , 
compared 
to 

million 
or 
 
 , 
for 
the 
annual 
goodwill 
impairment 
test 
completed 
as 
of 
July 
31, 
2021. 
 Accordingly, no 
impairment was recognized for 
BPPR or PB. 
The goodwill balance 
of BPPR and PB, 
as legal entities, 
represented 
 approximately 
 
 of the Corporation s total goodwill balance as of 
the July 31, 2022 valuation date. 
 An impairment of 

million was recognized by the Corporation from the annual test as of July 31, 2022 related to PEF as a result of 
 a decrease in the projected earnings of this 
business unit. 

 Furthermore, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
analyses, 
management 
performed 
a 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
aggregate 
fair 
values 
determined 
for 
the 
 reporting units to the market capitalization of the Corporation concluding that the 
fair value results determined for the reporting units 
 in the July 31, 2022 annual assessment were reasonable. 
 The goodwill 
impairment evaluation 
process requires 
the Corporation 
to 
make estimates 
and assumptions 
with regard 
to the 
fair 
 value 
of 
the 
reporting 
units. 
Actual 
values 
may 
differ 
significantly 
from 
these 
estimates. 
Such 
differences 
could 
result 
in 
future 
 impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively 
impact the Corporation s results of operations and the 
reporting units where the 
 goodwill is 
recorded. Declines in 
the Corporation s 
market capitalization and 
adverse economic conditions 
sustained over a 
longer 
 period of time negatively affecting forecasted cash flows could 
increase the risk of goodwill impairment in 
the future. 

 A decline in 
the Corporation s stock 
price related to 
global and/or regional macroeconomic 
conditions, a deterioration in 
the Puerto 
 Rico 
economy 
and 
fiscal 
situation, 
reduced 
future 
earnings 
estimates, 
additional 
expenses 
and 
higher 
credit 
losses, 
and 
the 
 continuance 
of 
the 
current 
interest 
rate 
environment 
could, 
individually 
or 
in 
the 
aggregate, 
have 
a 
material 
impact 
on 
the 
 determination 
of 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
reporting 
units, 
which 
could 
in 
turn 
result 
in 
an 
impairment 
of 
goodwill 
in 
the 
future. 
An 
 impairment of goodwill would result in a non-cash expense, net 
of tax impact. A charge to earnings related to a 
goodwill impairment 
 would not impact regulatory capital calculations.

 Accelerated share repurchase transaction ASR 
 On August 
24, 2022, 
the Corporation 
entered into 
a 

million ASR 
transaction with 
respect to 
its common 
stock (the 
 August 
 ASR Agreement ), which was accounted for as 
a treasury transaction. As a result of the 
receipt of the initial 

shares, 
the 
 Corporation recognized in stockholders equity approximately 

million in treasury stock and 

million as a reduction of capital 
 surplus. The Corporation completed the transaction on December 7, 2022 and received

the 
Corporation 
announced 
that 
on 
February 28, 
2022 
it 
entered 
into 
a 

million 
ASR 
transactions 
with 
 respect to

of common 
stock and 
recognized 

million in 
treasury stock 
with a 
corresponding increase 
in its 
 capital surplus. In 
total the Corporation 
repurchased a total 
of 

shares at an 
average purchased price 
of 

under 
 the March ASR Agreement. 
 On 
May 
3,

the 
Corporation 
entered

a 

million 
ASR 
transaction 
with 
respect

the Corporation 
entered into 
a 

million ASR 
transaction with 
respect to 
its common 
stock, which 
was

 stockholders equity 
approximately 

million in 
treasury stock 
and 

million as 
a reduction 
in capital 
surplus. On 
March 19, 
 2020 (the 
 early termination 
date ), the 
dealer counterparty 
to the 
ASR exercised 
its right 
to terminate 
the ASR 
as a 
result of 
the 
 trading price of the 
Corporation s common stock falling below a 
specified level due to the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the 
 global markets. As a result of such early 
termination, the final settlement of the ASR, which was 
expected to occur during the fourth 
 quarter 
of 
2020, 
occurred during 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2020. 
The 
Corporation completed 
the 
transaction on 
May 
27, 
2020 
and 
 received 

additional 
shares 
of 
common 
stock 
after 
the 
early 
termination 
date. 
In

 Statutory reserve 
 The 
Banking 
Act 
of 
the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto 
Rico 
requires that 

for 
the 
year 
be 
 transferred to 
a statutory 
reserve account 
until such 
statutory reserve 
equals the 
total of 
paid-in capital 
on common 
and preferred 
 stock. Any losses 
incurred by a 
bank must first 
be charged to 
retained earnings and then 
to the reserve 
fund. Amounts credited 
to 
 the 
reserve 
fund 
may 
not 
be 
used 
to 
pay 
dividends 
without 
the 
prior 
consent 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Commissioner 
of 
Financial 
 Institutions. 
The 
failure 
to 
maintain 
sufficient 
statutory 
reserves 
would 
preclude 
BPPR 
from 
paying 
dividends. 
BPPR s 
statutory 
 reserve fund 
amounted to 

million at 
December 31, 2022 
(2021 - 

million; 2020 - 

million). During 
2022, 

million 
 was transferred to the statutory reserve account (2021 - 

million, 2020 - 

million). BPPR was in compliance with the statutory 
 reserve requirement in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 , a 
CET1 ratio of 
at least 
 
 , a Tier 
1 risk-based capital 
ratio of at 
least 
 
 and 
a total risk-based 
ratio of 
at least 
 
 . 
Management 
has 
determined 
that 
at 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
Corporation 
exceeded 
all 
capital 
adequacy 
 requirements to which it is subject. 
 The Corporation 
has 
been designated 
by the 
Federal Reserve 
Board as 
a Financial 
Holding Company FHC and 
is eligible 
to 
 engage in certain financial activities permitted under 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. 
 Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on 
January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use a five-year 
transition 
 period 
option 
as 
permitted 
in 
the 
final 
interim 
regulatory 
capital 
rules 
effective 
March 
31, 
2020. 
The 
five-year 
transition 
period 
 provision delays for two years the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, followed 
 by a three-year transition period to phase out 
the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided 
during the initial two-year delay. 
 On 
August 
26, 
2020, 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
issued 
a 
final 
rule 
to 
modify 
the 
Basel 
III 
regulatory 
capital 
rules 
applicable 
to 
 banking organizations to allow 
those organizations participating in 
the Paycheck Protection Program PPP established under the 
 Coronavirus Aid, Relief 
and Economic Security 
Act (the 
 CARES Act to 
neutralize the regulatory 
capital effects 
of participating in 
 the 
program. 
Specifically, 
the 
agencies 
have 
clarified 
that 
banking 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Corporation 
and 
its 
Bank 
 subsidiaries, are permitted to 
assign a zero 
percent risk weight to 
PPP loans for 
purposes of determining risk-weighted 
assets and 
 risk-based 
capital 
ratios. 
Additionally, 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
use 
of 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
Liquidity 
Facility 
(the 
 PPPL 
 Facility ), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation s Bank subsidiaries to 
 fund PPP loans, the 
agencies further clarified that, 
for purposes of determining 
leverage ratios, a banking 
organization is permitted 
 to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a 
PPPL Facility. As of December 31, 
2022, 
 the Corporation has 

million in PPP loans and 

loans were pledged as collateral for PPPL 
Facilities. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, BPPR and 
PB were well-capitalized under the regulatory 
framework for prompt corrective action.

 In October 2022, the Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury 
securities with a fair value of 

billion (par value of 

billion) from its available-for-
 sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. Refer to Note 7 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional

million (December 
31, 2021 
- 

million), which 
represents the 
unamortized balance of 
the obligations undertaken 
in issuing 
the 
 guarantees under the standby 
letters of credit. 
In accordance with the 
provisions of ASC Topic 
460, the Corporation recognizes at 
 fair value the obligation at 
inception of the standby letters 
of credit. The fair value 
approximates the fee received from the 
customer 
 for issuing such commitments. These fees are deferred and are recognized over the commitment period. The contracted amounts 
in 
 standby letters of 
credit outstanding at 
December 31, 2022 
and 2021, shown 
in Note 24, 
represent the maximum 
potential amount 
 of future 
payments that 
the Corporation 
could be 
required to 
make under 
the guarantees 
in the 
event of 
nonperformance by 
the 
 customers. These 
standby letters 
of credit 
are used 
by the 
customers as 
a credit 
enhancement and 
typically expire 
without being 
 drawn 
upon. 
The 
Corporation s 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
are 
generally 
secured, 
and 
in 
the 
event 
of 
nonperformance 
by 
the 
 customers, the Corporation has rights to the underlying 
collateral provided, which normally includes cash, 
marketable securities, real 
 estate, receivables, and others. Management does 
not anticipate any material losses related to these 
instruments. 
 Also, from 
time to 
time, the 
Corporation securitized mortgage 
loans into 
guaranteed mortgage-backed securities 
subject in 
certain 
 instances, to lifetime 
credit recourse on 
the loans that 
serve as collateral 
for the 
mortgage-backed securities. The Corporation 
has 
 not sold 
any mortgage 
loans subject 
to credit 
recourse since 
2009. Also, 
from time 
to time, 
the Corporation 
may sell, 
in bulk 
sale 
 transactions, residential mortgage loans 
and Small Business Administration SBA commercial loans subject 
to credit recourse 
or 
 to certain representations 
and warranties from the 
Corporation to the purchaser. 
These representations and warranties 
may relate, 
 for example, to borrower creditworthiness, loan documentation, collateral, prepayment and early payment defaults. 
The Corporation 
 may be required to repurchase the loans under 
the credit recourse agreements or representation 
and warranties. 
 At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Corporation 
serviced 

billion 
(December 
31, 
2021 
- 

billion) 
in 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
 subject to 
credit recourse 
provisions, principally loans 
associated with 
FNMA and 
FHLMC residential 
mortgage loan 
securitization 
 programs. In the event 
of any customer default, pursuant to 
the credit recourse provided, the 
Corporation is required to repurchase 
 the 
loan 
or 
reimburse 
the 
third 
party 
investor 
for 
the 
incurred 
loss. 
The 
maximum 
potential 
amount of 
future 
payments 
that 
the 
 Corporation 
would 
be 
required 
to 
make 
under 
the 
recourse 
arrangements 
in 
the 
event 
of 
nonperformance 
by 
the 
borrowers 
is 
 equivalent 
to 
the 
total 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
serviced 
with 
recourse 
and 
interest, 
if 
applicable. 
 During 2022, 
the Corporation 
repurchased approximately 

million of 
unpaid principal 
balance in 
mortgage loans 
subject to 
the 
 credit recourse 
provisions (2021 
- 

million). In 
the event 
of nonperformance 
by the 
borrower, the 
Corporation has 
rights to 
the 
 underlying 
collateral 
securing 
the 
mortgage 
loan. 
The 
Corporation 
suffers 
losses 
on 
these 
loans 
when 
the 
proceeds 
from 
a 
 foreclosure sale 
of the 
property underlying 
a defaulted 
mortgage loan 
are less 
than the 
outstanding principal 
balance of 
the loan 
 plus any 
uncollected interest 
advanced and 
the costs 
of holding 
and disposing 
the related 
property. 
At 
December 31, 
2022, the 
 Corporation s liability 
established to cover 
the estimated credit 
loss exposure 
related to loans 
sold or serviced 
with credit 
recourse 
 amounted to 

million (December 
31, 2021 
- 

million).

repurchases 
under 
BPPR s 
representation 
and

arrangements 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 31, 2021. 
A substantial amount 
of these loans 
reinstate to performing 
status or 
have mortgage insurance, 
and thus the 
 ultimate losses on the loans are not deemed 
significant. 
 From 
time 
to 
time, the 
Corporation sells 
loans and 
agrees to 
indemnify the 
purchaser for 
credit 
losses 
or 
any 
breach 
of 
certain 
 representations and 
warranties made 
in connection 
with the 
sale. At 
December 31, 
2022, the 
Corporation s liability 
for estimated 
 losses associated with indemnifications and representations and warranties related to loans sold by BPPR 
amounted to 

million 
 (December 31, 2021 - 

million).

205 

billion in 
mortgage loans 
for third-parties, 
including the 
loans serviced 
with credit 
recourse (December 
 31, 2021 
- 

billion). The 
Corporation generally 
recovers funds 
advanced pursuant 
to these 
arrangements from 
the mortgage 
 owner, from 
liquidation proceeds when the 
mortgage loan is foreclosed 
or, in 
the case of 
FHA/VA loans, 
under the applicable FHA 
 and 
VA 
insurance 
and 
guarantees 
programs. 
However, 
in 
the 
meantime, 
the 
Corporation 
must 
absorb 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
funds 
it 
 advances 
during 
the 
time 
the 
advance 
is 
outstanding. 
The 
Corporation 
must 
also 
bear 
the 
costs 
of 
attempting 
to 
collect 
on 
 delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In 
addition, if a defaulted loan 
is not cured, the mortgage 
loan would be canceled as 
part 
 of 
the 
foreclosure 
proceedings 
and 
the 
Corporation would 
not 
receive 
any 
future 
servicing 
income 
with 
respect 
to 
that 
loan. 
At 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
funds 
advanced 
by 
the 
Corporation 
under 
such 
mortgage 
loan 
servicing 
 agreements 
was approximately 

million 
(December 31, 
2021 
- 

million). 
To 
the extent 
the mortgage 
loans underlying 
the 
 Corporation s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies, the 
Corporation would be required to dedicate 
additional cash 
 resources 
to 
comply 
with 
its 
obligation to 
advance 
funds 
as 
well as 
incur 
additional 
administrative costs 
related 
to 
increases 
in 
 collection efforts.

2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 In addition, at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PIHC 
fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a subordinated basis

Corporation also maintained 
other non-credit commitments 
for approximately

 Business concentration 
 Since the Corporation s business activities are concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, its results of operations and financial condition 
 are dependent 
upon the 
general trends 
of the 
Puerto Rico 
economy and, 
in particular, 
the residential 
and commercial 
real estate 
 markets. The concentration 
of the Corporation s 
operations in Puerto Rico 
exposes it to 
greater risk than other 
banking companies 
 with a wider geographic base. Its 
asset and revenue composition by geographical area 
is presented in Note 37 
to the Consolidated 
 Financial Statements. 

 Puerto 
Rico 
has 
faced 
significant 
fiscal 
and 
economic 
challenges 
for 
over 
a 
decade. 
In 
response 
to 
such 
challenges, 
the 
U.S. 
 Congress enacted the 
Puerto Rico Oversight 
Management and Economic Stability 
Act PROMESA in 
2016, which, among 
other 
 things, 
established 
the 
Oversight 
Board 
and 
a 
framework 
for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
debts 
of 
the 
Commonwealth, 
its 
 instrumentalities and 
municipalities. 
The 
Commonwealth and 
several 
of 
its 
instrumentalities have 
commenced 
debt 
restructuring 
 proceedings under 
PROMESA. As 
of the 
date of 
this report, 
while municipalities 
have been 
designated as 
covered entities 
under 
 PROMESA, 
no 
municipality 
has 
commenced, 
or 
has 
been 
authorized 
by 
the 
Oversight 
Board 
to 
commence, 
any 
such 
debt 
 restructuring proceeding under PROMESA. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Corporation s direct exposure to the 
Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities 
 totaled 

million, of which 

million were outstanding 

million and 

million at December 
31, 2021). Of 
the amount 
 outstanding, 

million 
consists 
of 
loans 
and 

million 
are 
securities 

million 
and 

million 
at 
December 31, 
2021). 
 Substantially all 
of the 
amount outstanding 
at December 
31, 2022 
and December 
31, 2021 
were obligations 
from various 
Puerto 
 Rico 
municipalities. 
In 
most 
cases, 
these 
were 
 general 
obligations 
of 
a 
municipality, 
to 
which 
the 
applicable 
municipality 
has 
 pledged 
its 
good 
faith, 
credit 
and 
unlimited 
taxing 
power, 
or 
 special 
obligations 
of 
a 
municipality, 
to 
which 
the 
applicable 
 municipality 
has 
pledged 
other 
revenues. 
At 
December 
31, 
2022, 

of 
the 
Corporation s 
exposure 
to 
municipal 
loans 
and 
 securities was concentrated in the municipalities of 
San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam n.

 governmental entities

principal source 
of repayment 
is non-governmental 

million at 
December 31, 
2021). 
 These 
included 

million 
in 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
insured 
by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Housing 
Finance 
Authority HFA ), 
a 
 governmental instrumentality that 
has been 
designated as a 
covered entity under 
PROMESA (December 31, 
2021 - 

million). 
 These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA 
insurance covers losses in 
 the event 
of a 
borrower default 
and upon 
the satisfaction 
of certain 
other conditions. 
The Corporation 
also had 
at December 
31, 
 2022, 

million in bonds 
issued by HFA 
which are secured by 
second mortgage loans on 
Puerto Rico residential properties, 
and 
 for which HFA 
also provides insurance to 
cover losses in 
the event of 
a borrower default 
and upon the 
satisfaction of certain 
other 
 conditions (December 
31, 2021 
- 

million). In 
the event 
that the 
mortgage loans 
insured by 
HFA 
and held 
by the 
Corporation 
 directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA 
bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the 
outstanding balance of 
 these loans, HFA s 
ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA 
at the time such 
 obligations 
become 
due 
and 
payable. The 
Corporation does 
not consider 
the 
government guarantee 
when 
estimating the 
credit 
 losses 
associated 
with 
this 
portfolio. 
Although 
the 
Governor 
is 
currently 
authorized 
by 
local 
legislation 
to 
impose 
a 
temporary 
 moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on 
such obligations has not been imposed as of 
the date hereof. 

 BPPR s 
commercial loan 
portfolio also 
includes loans 
to 
private borrowers 
who 
are service 
providers, lessors, 
suppliers or 
have 
 other relationships with the government. These 
borrowers could be negatively affected by 
the Commonwealth s fiscal crisis and 
the 
 ongoing 
Title 
III 
proceedings 
under 
PROMESA. 
Similarly, 
BPPR s 
mortgage 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolios 
include 
loans 
to 
 government 
employees 
and 
retirees, 
which 
could 
also 
be 
negatively 
affected 
by 
fiscal 
measures 
such 
as 
employee 
layoffs 
or 
 furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

 In 
addition, 

billion of 
residential mortgages, 

million of 
Small Business 
Administration SBA 
loans under 
the Paycheck 
 Protection Program PPP and 

million commercial loans were 
insured or guaranteed 
by the U.S. 
Government or its agencies 
 at December 31, 2022 (compared to 

billion, 

million and 

million, respectively, at December 31, 2021). The Corporation 
 also had U.S. Treasury and obligations from the U.S. Government, 
its agencies or government sponsored entities 
within the portfolio 
 of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities as described 
in Note 6 and 7 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
 At December 31, 
2022, the Corporation has 
operations in the United 
States Virgin Islands 
(the USVI and 
has approximately 
 
 million 
in 
direct 
exposure 
to 
USVI 
government 
entities 
(December 
31, 
2021 
- 

million). 
The 
USVI 
has 
been 
experiencing 
a 
 number of 
fiscal and 
economic challenges 
that could 
adversely affect 
the ability 
of its 
public corporations 
and instrumentalities 
to 
 service their outstanding 
debt obligations. 

 At December 
31, 2022, the 
Corporation has 
operations in the 
British Virgin 
Islands BVI ), 
which has 
been negatively affected 
by 
 the COVID-19 
pandemic, particularly 
as a 
reduction in 
the tourism 
activity which 
accounts for 
a significant 
portion of 
its economy. 
 Although 
the 
Corporation 
has 
no 
significant 
exposure 
to 
a 
single 
borrower 
in 
the 
BVI, 
it 
has 
a 
loan 
portfolio 
amounting 
to 

208 

million 
comprised 
of 
various 
retail 
and 
commercial 
clients, 
compared 
to 
a 
loan 
portfolio 
of 

million 
at 
 December 31, 2021.

to approximately 

million as 
 of 
December 
31, 
2022. 
In 
certain 
cases, 
management cannot 
reasonably 
estimate 
the 
possible 
loss 
at 
this 
time. 
Any 
estimate 
 involves significant judgment, given the 
varying stages of the 
Legal Proceedings (including the fact 
that many of them 
are currently 
 in preliminary stages), the 
existence of multiple 
defendants in several of 
the current Legal Proceedings 
whose share of liability 
has 
 yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in 
many of the Legal Proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty 
of the various 
 potential 
outcomes 
of 
such 
Legal 
Proceedings. 
Accordingly, 
management s 
estimate 
will 
change 
from 
time-to-time, 
and 
actual 
 losses may be more or less than the current estimate. 

 While the 
outcome of 
Legal Proceedings 
is inherently 
uncertain, based 
on information 
currently available, 
advice of 
counsel, and 
 available 
insurance 
coverage, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
amount 
it 
has 
already 
accrued 
is 
adequate 
and 
any 
incremental 
 liability arising from 
the Legal Proceedings 
in matters in 
which a loss 
amount can be 
reasonably estimated will not 
have a material 
 adverse effect 
on the Corporation s 
consolidated financial position. 
However, in 
the event 
of unexpected future 
developments, it is 
 possible that 
the ultimate 
resolution of 
these matters 
in a 
reporting period, if 
unfavorable, could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on 
 the Corporation s consolidated financial position for that period. 

 Set forth below is a description of the Corporation s 
significant Legal Proceedings. 
 BANCO POPULAR DE PUERTO RICO 
 Hazard Insurance Commission-Related Litigation 
 Popular, 
Inc., BPPR 
and Popular 
Insurance, LLC 
(the Popular 
Defendants were 
named defendants 
in a 
class action 
complaint 
 captioned P rez 
D az v. 
Popular, Inc., 
et al, 
filed before 
the Court 
of First 
Instance, Arecibo 
Part. The 
complaint originally 
sought 
 damages and preliminary and 
permanent injunctive relief on behalf 
of the class 
against the Popular Defendants, as 
well as Antilles 
 Insurance Company and MAPFRE-PRAICO Insurance Company (the Defendant 
Insurance Companies ). Plaintiffs alleged that the 
 Popular 
Defendants 
were 
unjustly 
enriched 
by 
failing 
to 
reimburse 
them 
for 
commissions 
paid 
by 
the 
Defendant 
Insurance 
 Companies 
to 
the 
insurance 
agent 
and/or 
mortgagee for 
policy years 
when 
no 
claims 
were 
filed 
against 
their 
hazard 
insurance 
 policies. They demanded 
the reimbursement to 
the purported class 
of an 
estimated 

million plus legal 
interest, for the 
 good 
 experience 
commissions 
allegedly 
paid 
by 
the 
Defendant 
Insurance 
Companies 
during 
the 
relevant 
time 
period, 
as 
well 
as 
 injunctive relief seeking to 
enjoin the Defendant Insurance 
Companies from paying commissions to 
the insurance agent/mortgagee 
 and ordering them 
to pay 
those fees 
directly to the 
insured. A motion 
for dismissal 
on the merits 
filed by 
the Defendant Insurance 
 Companies 
was 
denied and 
each 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Court 
of 
Appeals and 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Supreme 
Court 
denied the 
Popular 
 Defendants request to review the lower court s denial of the motion to dismiss. In December 2017, plaintiffs amended the complaint 
 and, 
in 
January 
2018, 
defendants 
filed 
an 
answer 
thereto. 
Separately, 
in 
October 
2017, 
the 
Court 
entered 
an 
order 
whereby 
it 
 broadly certified the 
class, after 
which the Popular 
Defendants filed a 
certiorari petition before 
the Puerto Rico 
Court of Appeals 
in 
 relation 
to 
the 
class 
certification, 
which 
the 
Court 
declined 
to 
entertain. 
In 
November 
2018 
and 
in 
January 
2019, 
plaintiffs 
filed 
 voluntary dismissal petitions against MAPFRE-PRAICO Insurance Company and 
Antilles Insurance Company, 
respectively, leaving 
 the Popular Defendants as the sole remaining 
defendants in the action.

Defendants' 
alleged 
violation 
of 
local 
and 
state 
sexual

laws. 
 Additionally, 
in July 
2019, PB

which it 
was named 
as a 
defendant along 
with six ) 
 current PB 
employees (collectively, 
the DR 
Defendants ), captioned Damian 
Reyes, et 
al. v. 
Popular Bank,

filed before the 
 Supreme Court 
of the 
State of 
New York 
(the DR 
Action ). The 
DR Action, 
filed by 
three ) current 
and former 
PB employees, 
 seeks to recover damages for the DR Defendants 
alleged violation of local and state discrimination and retaliation laws. Plaintiffs in 
 both complaints are represented by the same legal counsel, and 
five of the six named individual defendants in the DR 
Action are the 
 same named 
individual defendants 
in the 
AB Action. 
Both complaints 
are related, 
among other 
things, to 
allegations of 
purported 
 sexual harassment and/or misconduct by a former PB employee as 
well as PB s actions in connection thereto and seek no less than 

million in 
damages each. In 
October 2019, 
PB and 
the other 
defendants filed several 
Motions to 
Dismiss. Plaintiffs 
opposed 
 the motions 
in December 
2019 and 
PB and 
the other 
defendants replied 
in January 
2020. In 
July 2020, 
a hearing 
to discuss 
the 
 motions 
to 
dismiss filed 
by 
PB 
in 
both 
actions 
was 
held, at 
which 
the 
Court 
dismissed one 
of 
the causes 
of 
action 
included 
by 
 plaintiffs in the AB Action. 

 In 
June 
2021, 
the 
Court 
in the 
AB 
Action 
entered a 
judgment dismissing 
all 
claims 
except those 
regarding the 
principal 
plaintiff 
 Aileen Betances against PB for retaliation, and Betances claim against 
three ) other AB Defendants for aiding/abetting the alleged 
 retaliation. Also, in July 
2021, the Court 
in the DR 
action entered a partial 
judgment dismissing all claims 
against the individual DR 
 Defendants, 
with 
all 
surviving 
claims 
being 
against 
PB 
and 
limited 
to 
local 
retaliation 
claims 
and 
local 
and 
state 
discrimination 
 claims. Plaintiffs in both the AB Action and the DR Action filed notices of appeal of both judgments. On August 11, 2021, PB and the 
 remaining AB Defendants in the 
AB Action, as well as 
PB in the DR 
Action, answered the respective complaints as 
to the surviving 
 claims. 

212 

pending arbitration 
 proceedings with 
initial claimed 
amounts of 
approximately 

million in 
the aggregate. 
While Popular 
Securities believes 
it has 
 meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in these proceedings, 
it has often determined that it is in its best interest to settle certain 
 claims 
rather 
than 
expend 
the 
money 
and 
resources required 
to 
see 
such 
cases 
to 
completion. 
The 
Puerto 
Rico 
Government s 
 defaults and 
non-payment of 
its various 
debt obligations, 
as well 
as the 
Oversight Board 
decision to 
pursue restructurings 
under 
 Title III and 
Title VI of 
PROMESA, have impacted the number of 
customer complaints (and claimed damages) filed 
against Popular 
 Securities concerning Puerto Rico bonds and closed-end investment companies that invest primarily in Puerto 
Rico bonds. Adverse 
 results 
in 
the 
arbitration 
proceedings 
described 
above, 
or 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
customer 
complaints, 
could 
have 
a 
material 
 adverse effect on Popular. 
 In October 2021, a panel in an arbitration proceeding with claimed damages arising from trading losses of approximately 

million 
 ordered 
Popular 
Securities to 
pay 
claimants 
approximately 

million 
in 
compensatory 
damages and 
expenses. In 
November, 
 2021, 
the 
claimants 
in such 
arbitration proceeding 
filed 
a complaint 
captioned Trinidad 
Garc a v. 
Popular, 
Inc. 
et. 
al. 
before 
the 
 United 
States 
District 
Court 
for 
the 
District 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
against 
Popular, 
Inc., 
BPPR 
and 
Popular 
Securities 
(the 
 Popular 
 Defendants alleging, inter alia, 
that they sustained monetary 
losses as a 
result of the Popular 
Defendants anticompetitive, 
unfair, 
 and 
predatory 
practices, 
including 
tying 
arrangements 
prohibited 
by 
the 
Bank 
Holding 
Company 
Act. 
Plaintiffs 
claim 
that 
the 
 Popular Defendants caused them to 
enter a tying arrangement scheme whereby 
BPPR allegedly would extend secured credit 
lines 
 to the Plaintiffs on 
the conditions that they transfer 
their portfolios to Popular 
Securities to be used 
as pledged collateral and 
obtain 
 additional investment 
services and 
products solely 
from Popular 
Securities, not 
from any 
of its 
competitors. Plaintiffs 
also invoke 
 federal 
court s 
supplemental jurisdiction 
to 
allege 
several 
state 
law claims 
against 
the Popular 
Defendants, including 
contractual 
 fault, fault in causing losses in value of the pledge collateral, breach of contract, request for specific compliance thereof, fault in pre-
 contractual negotiations, emotional distress, and punitive damages. In January 2022, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, and the 
 Popular Defendants were served with summons on that same date. Plaintiffs demand no less than 

million in damages, plus an 
 award for costs and attorney's fees. The 
Popular Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss 
on March 21, 2022, which Plaintiffs 
opposed 
 on June 10, 2022. Popular 
filed its reply in support 
of the Motion to Dismiss 
on June 30, 2022, and 
Plaintiffs sur-replied on July 27, 
 2022. 

 On 
February 9, 
2023, the 
Popular Defendants 
executed a 
global 
settlement agreement 
with Plaintiffs 
resolving all 
controversies 
 between 
the 
parties, 
including 
those 
arising 
from 
the 
aforementioned 
case. 
After 
the 
parties 
filed 
a 
stipulation 
of 
dismissal, 
on 
 February 15, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico issued an order dismissing the case 
with prejudice 
 and stating that a judgment shall be entered accordingly. 
This matter is now closed.

million when they 
were acquired by BPPR 
in 2010. Between 
2011 
 and 2014, 
the loans 
were restructured to 
consist of 
(i) 

notes with 
an aggregate 
outstanding principal 
balance of 

million 
 with 
a 

annual interest 
rate Notes A 
and 
(ii) 

notes 
with 
an 
aggregate outstanding 
balance 
of 

million 
with a 

annual interest 
rate, to 
be paid 
upon maturity Notes B ). 
The restructured 
notes had 
an original 
maturity of 
September 30, 
2016 
 and, thereafter, various 
interim renewals were approved to allow 
for the re-negotiation of a 
longer-term extension. The last of these 
 interim 
renewals, 
among 
other 
things, 
extended the 
maturity 
date until 
April 
2022, 
decreased 
the 
interest 
rate 
applicable 
to 
the 
 Notes A 
to 
 
 and 
maintained the 
Notes B at 
an interest 
rate of 
 
 . In 
March and July 
2022, the Audit 
Committee authorized 
 two 
separate 
90-day interim 
maturity extensions 
to 
provide additional 
time 
for 
the Bank 
to 
analyze and 
negotiate the 
terms 
and 
 conditions 
for 
a 
longer-term 
renewal 
of 
the 
credit 
facilities. 
In 
November 
2022, 
BPPR 
and 
related 
parties 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
 director entered into a three-year extension of 
the loans, until November 2025, which, among 
other things: (i) increased the interest 
 rate applicable to Notes A to 
 
 and maintained the Notes B 
at an interest rate of 
 
 and (ii) established a 
principal repayment 
 schedule for 
Notes A, 
including a 

million mandatory prepayment. 
The three-year extension 
of the 
loans was 
approved by the 
 Audit Committee in accordance with the Related Party 
Policy. The aggregate outstanding 
balance on the loans as of December 
31, 
 2022 was approximately 

million, of which approximately 

million corresponded to Notes A 
and 

million to Notes B. 
 During 2022, the borrower paid approximately 

million and 

million in principal and interest, respectively.

million. In May 2017, this loan 
was sold by BPPR to Popular, 
Inc., holding company PIHC ). At the time 
 of sale, the loan had an unpaid principal balance of 

million. PIHC paid 

million to BPPR for the loan, of which 

million 
 was recognized by BPPR as a capital contribution representing the difference 
between the fair value and the book value of the 
loan 
 at the 
time of 
transfer. 
Immediately upon 
being acquired 
by PIHC, 
the loan s 
maturity was 
extended by 
90 days 
(under the 
same 
 terms as 
originally contracted) to 
provide the PIHC 
additional time to 
evaluate a refinancing 
or long-term extension 
of the loan. 
In 
 August 2017, the credit 
facility was refinanced with 
a stated maturity in 
February 2019. 
During 2017, the facility 
was subject to the 

220 
 
 million 
were 
deferred 
and 
capitalized 
as 
part 
of 
the 
loan 
balance. 
In 
February 
2019, 
the 
Audit 
Committee 
approved, 
under 
the 
 Related Party Policy, a 
 
 -month renewal of the loan at an interest rate of 
 
 and a 
 
 -year amortization schedule. In
 December 
 2021, the Corporation refinanced the then-current 

million principal balance of the loan 
at an interest rate of 
 
 , a maturity 
 date of December 
2026 and a 
 
 -year amortization schedule. Payments 
of principal and 
interest of approximately 

million and 

million, 
respectively, 
were 
made 
during 
2022. 
As 
of 
December 
31,

balance 
of 
the 
loan 
was

 From 
time 
to 
time, 
the 
Corporation,

the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
business, 
obtains 
services 
from 
related 
parties 
that 
have 
some

terms of such

 For 
the 
year 
ended 
December

2022, 
the

Foundation, which 
are not-for-profit

This 
 investment was 
accounted for 
under the

The Corporation 
recorded 

million in 
dividends from 
its investment 
in 
 Evertec during the year ended December 31, 2022 
(December 31, 2021 -

 As discussed 
in Note 
4, Business 
combination, on 
July 1, 
2022, BPPR 
completed its 
previously announced 
acquisition of 
certain 
 assets from Evertec 
Group to service certain 
BPPR channels. In connection 
with the Business Acquisition 
Transaction, BPPR also 
 entered 
into 
amended 
and 
restated 
service 
agreements 
with 
Evertec 
Group 
pursuant 
to 
which 
Evertec 
Group 
will 
continue 
to 
 provide various information technology 
and transaction processing services 
to Popular, 
BPPR and their 
respective subsidiaries. As 
 part 
of 
the 
transaction, 
BPPR 
and 
Evertec 
entered 
into 
a 
revenue 
sharing 
structure 
for 
BPPR 
in 
connection 
with 
its 
merchant 
 acquiring relationship 
with Evertec. 
As consideration 
for the 
Business Acquisition 
Transaction, 
BPPR delivered 
to Evertec 
Group 

shares of Evertec common stock valued at 
closing at 

million (based on Evertec s stock price 
on June 30, 2022 of 
 
). As a result of the exchange of shares, the 
Corporation recognized a pre-tax gain of 

million. 
 Additionally, on August 15, 2022, the Corporation completed the sale of its remaining 

shares of common stock of Evertec, 
 Inc.. 
Following 
the 
Evertec 
Stock 
Sale, 
Popular 
no 
longer 
owns 
any 
Evertec 
common 
stock. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
Corporation 
 discontinued accounting for its 
proportionate share of Evertec s 
income (loss) and changes in 
stockholder s equity under the equity 
 method of 
accounting in the 
third quarter of 
2022. The Corporation 
recognized a pre-tax 
gain on the 
Evertec Stock Sale 
of

 For 2022, significant components of the Pension Plans 
actuarial gain that changed the benefit obligation were 
mainly related to an increase in the 
 single weighted-average discount rates partially offset 
by a lower return on the fair value of plan assets. For OPEB 
Plans significant components of 
 the actuarial gain that change the benefit obligation 
were mainly related to an increase in discount rates and 
the per capita claim assumption at year-
 end which was lower than expected partially offset 
by the health care cost trend assumption which 
was updated to reflect inflationary pressures in 
 the health care industry. 
For 2021, significant components of the Pension Plans 
actuarial gain that changed the benefit obligation 
were mainly 
 related to an increase in the single weighted-average discount 
rates partially offset by a lower return on the 
fair value of plan assets. For OPEB 
 Plans significant components of the actuarial gain that change 
the benefit obligation were mainly related to an increase 
in discount rates and the per 
 capita claim assumption at year-end which was lower than 
expected. 
The per capita claim methodology for the fully insured 
Medicare Advantage 
 plans changed from age-based per capita cost to cost that 
do not vary by age.

 Potential common shares consist of shares of common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock

performance 
share 
awards 
using 
the

method. 
This

common 
shares 
are 
 issued and 
the proceeds 
from exercise, 
in addition 
to the 
amount of 
compensation cost 
attributed to 
future services, 
are used 
to 
 purchase shares of common stock at the exercise date. The difference between the number of potential common shares issued and 
 the shares 
of common 
stock 
purchased is 
added as 
incremental shares 
to 
the actual 
number of

to 
 
 years considers 
options to 
extend the 
leases for 
up to

Corporation identifies 
leases when 
it has 
both the 
right to 
 obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from 
the use of the asset and the right to direct 
the use of the asset. 
 The Corporation 
recognizes right-of-use 
assets ROU 
assets and 
lease liabilities 
related to 
operating and 
finance leases 
in its 
 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition under the caption of other assets and other liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 14

Note 
19 
to 
the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements, 
respectively, 
for 
information 
on 
the 
balances of 
these 
lease 
assets 
and 
 liabilities. 
 The Corporation uses the 
incremental borrowing rate for 
purposes of discounting lease payments 
for operating and finance leases, 
 since it 
does not have 
enough information to 
determine the rates 
implicit in the 
leases. The discount 
rates are based 
on fixed-rate 
 and 
fully 
amortizing 
borrowing 
facilities 
of 
its 
banking 
subsidiaries 
that 
are 
collateralized. 
For 
leases 
held 
by 
non-banking 
 subsidiaries, a credit spread is added to this rate 
based on financing transactions with a 
similar credit risk profile.

The

under 
the 
Incentive 
Plan 
consist 
of 
the 
opportunity 
to 
receive 
shares 
of 
Popular, 
Inc. s 
 common stock provided that the Corporation achieves certain goals during a three-year performance cycle. 
The goals will be based 
 on 
two 
metrics 
weighted 
equally: 
the 
Relative 
Total 
Shareholder 
Return TSR 
and, 
depending 
on 
the 
date 
of 
the 
grant, 
the 
 Absolute Return 
on Average 
Assets ROA goal 
or the 
Absolute Return on 
Average Tangible 
Common Equity ROATCE 
goal. 

 The TSR metric is considered to be a market condition under ASC 718. 
For equity settled awards based on a market condition, the 
 fair value is determined as of the grant date and is not subsequently revised based on actual performance. 
The ROA and ROATCE 
 metrics 
are considered 
to 
be a 
performance condition 
under ASC 
718. 
The fair 
value is 
determined based 
on the 
probability of 
 achieving the ROA or ROATCE 
goal as of each reporting period. 
The TSR and ROA or ROATCE 
metrics are equally weighted and

Income tax expense 

million, compared to 

million 
 for the 
same period 
of 2021. 
The decrease 
in income 
tax expense was 
mainly due 
to the 
reversal of a 
portion of 
the deferred 
tax 
 asset DTA valuation allowance of the U.S. operations amounting to 

million, to higher taxable income subject to preferential 
 tax rates, primarily attributed to the gain from the 
sale of Evertec shares, and 
higher tax-exempt income recorded during this 
year. 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the 
net tax effects 
of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for 
 financial reporting 
purposes and 
their tax 
bases. Significant 
components of 
the Corporation s 
deferred tax 
assets and 
liabilities at

million with 
a valuation 
allowance of 

million, for a net DTA of 

million. The Corporation evaluates on a quarterly basis the realization of the deferred tax asset 
 by taxing jurisdiction. 
The U. S. operations sustained profitability for the three years period ended December 31, 2022. 
Years 2020 
 and 2021 were 
impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic and other 
events. 
Year 
2020 was unfavorably 
impacted by the 
ACL reserve 
 build-ups and the impairment 
of expenses on the branch 
closures in the New 
York 
region. Year 
2021 had been favorably impacted 
 by a strong economic recovery that resulted in ACL reserve releases, reversing the year 2020 build-up. 
The financial results for the 
 year ended December 31, 2022, demonstrate financial stability for the 
U. S. operations, despite the climate of uncertainty as a result 
 of 
recent global 
geopolitical challenges. 
These historical 
financial results 
together with 
pre-tax earnings 
forecasts are 
objectively 
 verifiable positive evidence, evaluated in 
addition to positive evidence 
of stable credit metrics, 
in combination with the 
length of the 
 expiration of the NOLs. 
On the other hand, the Corporation evaluated the negative evidence 
accumulated over the years, including 
 financial 
results 
lower 
than 
expectations 
in 
prior 
years, 
and 
challenges 
to 
the 
economy 
due 
to 
global 
geopolitical 
uncertainty. 
 Accordingly, 
after weighting 
all positive 
and negative 
evidence, the 
Corporation recorded 
during the 
fourth quarter 
of year 
2022 a 
 partial release of its 
valuation allowance amounting to 

million and concluded that 
it is more 
likely than not that 
approximately 

million of the 
DTA from 
the U.S. Operations will 
be realized. The 
Corporation has approximately 

million in deferred 
tax 
 asset related 
to federal 
NOLs with 
expiration dates 
between 2028 
and 2033 
and 

million in 
DTA 
related to 
state NOLs 
with 
 expiration dates 
between 2030 
and 2036. 
The Corporation 
based this 
determination on 
its estimated 
earnings available 
to realize 
 the deferred tax asset for the remaining carryforward period, together 
with the historical level of book income adjusted by permanent 
 differences. 
Management will continue 
to monitor and 
review the U. 
S. operation s 
results, the pre-tax 
earnings forecast, any 
new 
 tax initiative, and other factors, including net income 
versus forecast, targeted loan growth, net interest income 
margin, allowance for 
 credit losses, charge offs, NPLs inflows and NPA balances. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Corporation s net deferred 
tax assets related to its Puerto Rico operations 
amounted to 

million. 
 The Corporation s 
Puerto Rico 
Banking operation 
is not 
in a 
cumulative loss 
position and 
has sustained 
profitability for 
the three 
 years period ended 
December 31, 2022. 
This is considered 
a strong piece 
of objectively verifiable 
positive evidence that 
outweigh 
 any 
negative evidence 
considered by 
management in 
the 
evaluation of 
the 
realization of 
the 
deferred tax 
asset. 
Based 
on 
this 

253 

million as of December 2022. 
 Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the 
Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable 
entities and are 
 not 
entitled to 
file consolidated 
tax returns. 
However, 
certain subsidiaries 
that 
are organized 
as limited 
liability companies 
with a 
 partnership 
election 
are 
treated 
as 
pass-through entities 
for 
Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
purposes. The 
Code provides 
a 
dividends-received 
 deduction of 

on dividends 
received from 
 controlled subsidiaries 
subject to 
taxation in 
Puerto Rico 
and 

on dividends 
 received from other taxable domestic corporations. 
 The Corporation s 
subsidiaries in 
the United 
States file 
a consolidated 
federal income 
tax return. 
The intercompany 
settlement of 
 taxes paid is based on tax sharing agreements 
which generally allocate taxes to each 
entity based on a separate return basis. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of 
unrecognized tax benefits.

million 
 (2021 - 

million). The 
total interest 
expense recognized 
during 2022 
was 

thousand net 
of a 
reduction of 

thousand 
 due to the 
expiration of the 
statute of limitation 
(2021 - 

thousand net of 
a reduction of 

million). Management determined 
 that, as of 
December 31, 2022 
and 2021, there 
was no need 
to accrue for 
the payment of 
penalties. The Corporation s 
policy is to 
 report interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, while the penalties, if any, are reported in other operating 
 expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 

 After consideration 
of the 
effect on 
U.S. federal 
tax of 
unrecognized U.S. 
state tax 
benefits, the 
total amount 
of unrecognized 
tax 
 benefits, including U.S. 
and Puerto Rico 
that, if recognized 
through earnings, would 
affect the Corporation s 
effective tax rate, 
was 
 approximately 

million at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 

million). 
 The amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits 
may increase or 
decrease in the 
future for various 
reasons including adding amounts 
for 
 current 
tax 
year 
positions, 
expiration 
of 
open 
income 
tax 
returns 
due 
to 
the 
statute 
of 
limitations, 
changes 
in 
management s 
 judgment about 
the level 
of uncertainty, 
status of 
examinations, litigation 
and legislative 
activity, 
and the 
addition or 
elimination of 
 uncertain tax positions. 
 The 
Corporation and 
its subsidiaries 
file 
income tax 
returns in 
Puerto 
Rico, the 
U.S. federal 
jurisdiction, various 
U.S. states 
and 
 political subdivisions, and 
foreign jurisdictions. As 
of December 31, 
2022, the 
following years remain 
subject to 
examination in the 
 U.S. 
Federal 
jurisdiction 
 
2019 
and 
thereafter 
and 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
jurisdiction 
 
2018 
and 
thereafter. 
The 
Corporation 
 anticipates 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
unrecognized 
tax 
benefits 
within 
the 
next 
12 
months, 
which 
could

the entire
Board 
of Directors, may 
be removed by 
the stockholders

 only for cause.

and the Bylaws also 
provide that the affirmative vote of 
the holders of at least
two-thirds

of the

 Company prior to 
the meeting at

Agreement under 
which
the 
Trust 
operates defines 
the financial

in 
a manner that 
causes those financial

Company 
to the 
extent described 
under
 Description 
of

 the 
Guarantee . 

The 
Guarantee, 
when 

taken 
together 
with 

the 
Company s 
obligations 

under 
the 
Trust 
Agreement,

 including the Company s 
obligations to pay costs, expenses, debts and
liabilities of the 
Trust, other than with respect 
 to the
Trust

effect of 
providing
a 
full and unconditional 
guarantee of amounts 
due on
the 
Capital 
 Securities. The Property
Trustee, 
in its role as the guarantee trustee with respect to the Trust, 
holds the Guarantee for

 the benefit of the holders of the Capital Securities. The 
Guarantee does not cover
payment of distributions or amounts 
 payable on redemption 
or liquidation of the
Capital

does not have funds 
on hand available

 to make such payments. 
 The
Capital Securities 
were issued in 
the form of 
one or
more 
global securities deposited with 
The Depository

 Trust Company DTC ).

 The Capital Securities are 
securities of the
Trust 
and are issued pursuant 
to the Trust 
Agreement. Under the

 Trust 
Agreement,
the 
Trust 
holds the 
Debentures
for 
the benefit 
of the 
holders
of 
the Trust 
Securities. The 
Capital

 Securities are limited to 130,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount. The
Capital 
Securities are traded on The Nasdaq 
 Stock Market LLC under the trading
symbol BPOPM . 
 Distributions

 Distributions on the Capital Securities are fixed at an annual rate of 6.125 of the stated liquidation amount

 of 25 per Capital Security. 
Distributions under the Trust Agreement are
cumulative. 
 Distributions under 
the
currently 
effective Trust 
Agreement are 
payable
monthly 
in arrears on 
the first 
day

 of each 
month,
commencing 
on September 
1, 2009. 
Distributions
under 
the Amended 
and Restated 
Declaration of

 Trust and Trust 
Agreement dated as of
November 
30, 2004 (the Initial Trust 
Agreement were payable
monthly 
in 
 arrears on the first day of each month commencing on January 1, 2005.
Funds available for distributions 
with respect 
 to the Capital Securities are
limited to payments received from the Company 
on the Debentures. 
 If the Trust is
terminated and 
its assets distributed, for 
each Capital Security, each holder
is 
entitled to receive

 a 
like 

amount 
of 
the 
Debentures 

held 
by 
the 
Trust 

or 
the 
liquidation 

amount 
of 
 25 
plus
accumulated 
but 
unpaid

 distributions from 
the
assets 
of the 
Trust 
available
for 
distribution, after 
it has 
paid
liabilities 
owed to 
its creditors,

 subject to the rights of the holders of the Common Securities to receive a pro rata distribution.
Distributions 
to which 
 holders of the Capital Securities
are 
entitled and that are past 
due will accumulate additional distributions to
the 
extent 
 permitted by applicable
law, 
at an annual rate of 6.125 of the unpaid distributions, compounded monthly. 
The term

 distribution includes any additional distributions payable unless
otherwise 
stated. 
 The term like amount as used in this description
means: 
 
 with respect
to a redemption 
of any Trust Securities, 
Capital Securities or Common 
Securities
having a 
 liquidation amount equal 
to that
portion 
of the principal amount 
of the Debentures held 
by the
Trust 
to 

5 
 be
contemporaneously 
redeemed in 
accordance with 
the
Indenture, 
the proceeds 
of which 
are
used 
to 
 pay the redemption price of the Capital Securities or Common
Securities and

with respect to a
distribution of 
the Debentures held by the Trust 
to holders of any Capital Securities or

 Common 
Securities
in 
exchange therefor 
in connection 
with
a 
dissolution or 
liquidation of 
the Trust,

 Debentures held 
by the
Trust 
having a 
principal amount 
equal to
the 
liquidation amount 
of the Capital

 Securities or Common Securities of the holder to whom the Debentures 
would be
distributed. 
 Under the 
Trust
Agreement, 
the amount of 
distributions payable 
for any
period 
less than a 
full distribution

 period is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30- day months and the actual number of days elapsed in

 a partial month in 
that period. Under the Trust Agreement,
the 
amount of distributions payable for 
any full distribution

 period is computed by dividing the rate per annum by twelve.

 Payment of Distributions

 The Trust pays 
distributions on its Capital
Securities 
to DTC, which credits 
the applicable accounts at 
DTC

 on the 
applicable
payment 
dates, or 
if the 
securities
certificate 
for the 
Capital Securities 
is
no 
longer held 
by or 
on

 behalf of DTC, 
the
Trust 
will make the 
payments by 
check mailed
to 
the addresses of 
the holders as 
such addresses

 appear on the books and records of the Trust on the 
applicable record dates.
However, a holder of 1 
million or more 
 in aggregate
liquidation 
amount of the 
Capital Securities may receive 
distribution
payments, other 
than distributions 
 payable
at 
maturity, 
by wire transfer 
of
immediately 
available funds 
upon written 
request to
the 
Trust not 
later than

 15 calendar days prior to the date on which the 
distribution is payable. The
record date for distributions on the Capital 
 Securities is the fifteenth day of the month preceding the
distribution 
date, whether or not a business day. 
 The Trust pays
distributions 
through the Property 
Trustee. The Property Trustee holds 
amounts
received from 
 the Debentures in the payment account for the benefit of the holders of the
Trust 
Securities. 
 If
a 
distribution 
is
payable 
pursuant 
to
the 
Trust 
Agreement 
on
a 
day that 
is not 
a
business 
day, 
then that

 distribution is to be paid 
on the next day
that 
is a business day, and without any interest 
or other payment for
any 
delay 
 with the same force and effect as if made on the payment date.

 The Trust 
Agreement
defines 
a business 
day as 
a
day 
other than 
a Saturday, 
a
Sunday 
or any 
other day 
on

 which banking institutions in 
New
York, 
New York, 
San Juan, Puerto Rico or 
Wilmington,
Delaware 
are authorized 
 or required by
law, 
regulation or executive order to remain closed or are customarily closed.

 Deferral of Distributions

 As long as there is no event of default under the Debentures, the Company has the
right 
to defer payments of 
 interest on the Debentures at any time and from time
to 
time by extending the interest payment period for a period (an 
 Extension
Period of up to 60 consecutive months, but not beyond the maturity 
of the Debentures.

 As a consequence, during an Extension 
Period, the Trust will defer
payment 
of the monthly distributions on 
 the Capital Securities. The accumulated
but unpaid 
distributions will continue to accumulate additional distributions, 
 as
permitted by applicable law, 
at an annual rate of 6.125 compounded monthly.

 While the Company defers interest payments on the Debentures, it will be
restricted 
from:

declaring 

or 
paying 
any 

dividends 
or 
distributions 

on, 
or 
redeeming, 

purchasing, 
acquiring 
or

 making a liquidation payment on, any shares of its capital stock and

making 

payments 
on 
or 

repaying, 
repurchasing 
or 

redeeming 
any 
of 
its 

debt 
securities 
that 
rank

 equal or junior to the Debentures.

 If the 
Trust 
defers
distributions, 
the
deferred 
distributions, 
including 

accumulated 
additional distributions, 
 are
to 
be paid 
on the 
distribution
payment 
date following 
the last 
day
of 
the Extension 
Period to 
the
holders 
on the 
 record date
for 
that distribution payment 
date. Upon termination 
of an Extension
Period 
and payment of all 
amounts 

6 
 due on the Capital
Securities, the 
Company may elect to begin a 
new Extension Period with respect
to 
the Debentures, 
 subject to the above conditions.

 Redemption

 Repayment or Redemption of the Debentures

 When the Company 
repays or
redeems 
the Debentures, whether at 
stated maturity or 
upon earlier redemption,

 the Property Trustee 
will apply
the 
proceeds from the 
repayment or redemption 
to redeem
Capital 
Securities having 
 an aggregate liquidation amount
equal 
to that portion of 
the principal amount of 
Debentures being repaid or
redeemed.

 The 
redemption 

price 
per 
security 
is
the 
 25 
liquidation 
amount, 

plus 
accumulated 
but
unpaid 
distributions 
to 
the

 redemption date. 
 If less
than all of 
the Debentures are to 
be repaid or redeemed, 
then the aggregate
liquidation 
amount of the 
 Trust Securities to be redeemed will be allocated
approximately 3 to the 
Common Securities and 97 to the Capital 
 Securities,
except in the case of an event of default as a result of any failure by the Company to make 
any principal or

 interest payments under the Debentures when due.

 The Company 
has
the 
right, 
subject
to 
any 
required 
prior 

approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve,
to 
redeem 
the 
 Debentures
at a redemption price equal to 100 
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest to the date

 of redemption:

on or after December
1, 2009, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, 
at any time and

in 

whole, 
but not 
in
part, 
at 
any 
time
within 
90 days 
following 
the
occurrence 
and 
continuation 
of
a 
Tax 
 Event, an Investment Company Event or a Capital
Treatment 
Event, each as described below. 
 If less than all of the
Debentures 
are to be repaid or redeemed on 
the date of redemption, then the
proceeds 
from 
 such repayment or redemption will be allocated to the redemption of
Trust 
Securities proportionately. 
 A redemption of the Debentures will cause a
mandatory redemption of the Trust 
Securities. 
 Tax Event;
Investment 
Company Event; Capital Treatment Event 
 A Tax
Event , 
under the Trust Agreement, means the 
receipt by the Trust of an
opinion 
of counsel experienced 
 in such matters to the effect that as a result of:

any amendment
to, 
or change, including any 
announced prospective change, 
in the laws,
or 
any regulations 
 thereunder,
of 
the United States or 
any political subdivision 
thereof or
Puerto 
Rico, or a taxing 
authority of

 the United States or Puerto Rico, affecting taxation or

any official or
administrative pronouncement or 
action or judicial decision 
interpreting or applying such laws

 or regulations 
 there
is more than an insubstantial risk that:

 (1)
 the 

Trust 
is, or 
will be 
within
90 
days of 
the
delivery 
of 
the
opinion 
of 
counsel, 
subject
to 
United 
States 
 federal
or Puerto Rico income tax with respect to income received 
or accrued on the Debentures held by the

 Trust 

 (2)
 interest payable by the
Company to the Trust on the 
Debentures held by the Trust is not, or 
will not be within

 90 days of the delivery of the opinion of counsel, deductible by the Company, in whole or in part, for Puerto

 Rico income tax purposes or for U.S. income tax purposes, to the extent
applicable 
to the Company or

 (3)
 the 

Trust 
is, or 
will
be 
within 
90 
days 

of 
the delivery 
of 
the
opinion 
of 
counsel, 
subject 

to 
more 
than 
an

 immaterial amount of taxes, duties or other governmental charges. 

7 
 If a Tax
Event 
has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Trust 
Agreement, and the Trust is the holder of

 all the Debentures, the Company 
will pay any additional sums
required 
so that distributions on the Capital 
Securities

 will 
not 

be 
reduced 
by 
any 

additional 
taxes 
(other 

than 
withholding 
taxes), 

duties 
or 
other 

governmental 
charges 
 payable by the Trust as a result of the
Tax 
Event. 
 An
 Investment 
Company Event , 
under
the 
Trust 
Agreement, means 
the
receipt 
by the 
Trust 
of
an 
opinion of 
 counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result
of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or 
 a written change, including any announced prospective change,
in 
interpretation or application of law or 
regulation by

 any legislative body, 
court, governmental agency or
regulatory 
authority, there 
is more than an insubstantial risk that

 the 
Trust 
is
or 
will be 
considered 
an
 investment 
company 
that 
is
required 
to be 
registered 
under
the 
Investment 
 Company Act.

 A Capital Treatment 
Event , under
the 
Trust Agreement, 
means the reasonable 
determination
of 
the Company

 that, 
as 

a 
result 
of 
any 

amendment 
to, 
or 

change 
in, 
including 

any 
announced 
proposed 

change 
in, 
the 
laws 

or

 regulations 
of 

the 
United 
States 
or 

any 
political 
subdivision 

thereof 
or 
therein, 
or 

as 
a 
result 
of 

any 
official 
or

 administrative 
pronouncement 

or action 
or judicial 
decision interpreting 
or
applying 
such laws 
or regulations, 
that

 there is more than 
an insubstantial risk
that 
the Company will not 
be entitled to treat 
an amount equal
to 
the liquidation 
 amount
of 
the Capital 
Securities
as 
Tier 
1 capital, 
or
the 
then-equivalent thereof, 
for purposes 
of
capital 
adequacy 
 guidelines of the Federal Reserve, as then in effect and
applicable 
to the Company. 
 Redemption Procedures

 The Trust may redeem the Capital Securities only in an amount equal to the funds it has on hand and legally

 available to pay the redemption price.

 The Property 
Trustee 
will
mail 
written notice 
of the 
redemption
of 
the Capital 
Securities to 
the registered

 holders 
at 

least 
30 
but 
not 

more 
than 
60 
days 

before 
the 
date 
fixed 

for 
redemption. 
If 
the 

Trust 
gives 
a 
notice 

of

 redemption, 
then, 

by 
12:00 
noon, 
New 

York 
City 
time, 
on 

the 
date 
of 

redemption, 
if 
the 
funds 

are 
available 
for

 payment, the Property Trustee will, for Capital Securities 
held in book-entry
form: 
 
 irrevocably
deposit with DTC funds sufficient to pay the redemption 
price and

give 

DTC irrevocable 
instructions and 
authority 
to
pay 
the redemption 
price 
to
the 
holders of 
the Capital

 Securities. 
 With respect to
the Capital 
Securities not held in 
book-entry form, if funds 
are available
for 
payment, the Property 
 Trustee will:

irrevocably deposit
with the paying agent funds sufficient 
to pay the redemption price and

give the paying agent
irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders of the 
 Capital Securities upon surrender of the
certificates evidencing the 
Capital Securities. 
 Notwithstanding the
above, 
distributions payable on 
or prior to 
the date
of 
redemption for Capital 
Securities called

 for redemption are payable to the holders of the Capital Securities on 
the
applicable record dates. 
 Once notice 
of
redemption 
pursuant to 
the Trust 
Agreement
is 
given and 
funds are 
deposited,
then 
all rights 
of 
 the
holders of the Capital Securities called for redemption terminate, except the right to receive the 
redemption price,

 but without any interest or other payment for any 
delay in receiving it. If such
notice 
of redemption is given and funds 
 deposited as required, the Capital
Securities then will cease to be outstanding.

 If 
payment 
of
the 
redemption 
price 
for 

the
Capital 
Securities 
called 

for 
redemption 
is
improperly 
withheld 
or

 refused and not 
paid either by
the 
Trust or 
by the Company 
under the
Guarantee, 
then distributions on 
those Capital

 Securities will 
continue
to 
accumulate at 
the then-applicable 
rate,
from 
the date 
of redemption 
to
the 
date of 
actual 

8 
 payment.
In 
this case, 
the actual 
payment
date 
will be 
the date 
fixed
for 
redemption for 
purposes of 
calculating the

 redemption 
price.

 If less than all of the Trust Securities are redeemed, then the aggregate liquidation amount of the
Trust 
Securities

 to 
be 

redeemed 
normally 
will 

be 
allocated 
approximately 

3 
to 
the 
Common 

Securities 
and 
97 
to 

the 
Capital 
 Securities. However, if
an 
event of default 
has occurred as 
a
result 
of any failure 
by the Company 
to make
any 
principal 
 or interest payments
under 
the Debentures when due, 
holders of the Capital Securities 
will be paid
in 
full before any 
 payments are made
to 
holders of the Common 
Securities. The Property Trustee selects 
the
particular Capital Securities 
 to be 
redeemed
on 
the pro 
rata basis 
described
above 
not more 
than 60 
days
before 
the date 
of redemption 
by any

 method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate or, 
if the Capital
Securities are then held in book-entry form, 
 in accordance with DTC s
customary 
procedures. 
 Under the Trust
Agreement, 
if any 
date fixed for 
redemption is
not 
a business 
day, then payment of the 
redemption

 price will be made on the next day that is a business day, 
without any interest or
other payment for the delay.

 Subject 
to 

the 
above 
and 

applicable 
law 
and 

regulations, 
including 
United 

States 
federal 
securities 

laws 
and 
 banking
laws 
and regulations, 
the Company 
or
its 
affiliates 
may, 
under
the 
Trust Agreement, 
at any 
time
and 
from 
 time to time
purchase 
outstanding Capital Securities by 
tender, in the 
open market or by
private 
agreement, and may 
 resell the Capital Securities.

 Ranking of Capital Securities

 Payment of distributions on, and the redemption price of 
and the liquidation
distribution in respect of 
Capital 
 Securities
and 
Common Securities, 
as applicable, 
are
made 
pro rata 
based on 
the
relative 
liquidation amount 
of the

 Capital 
Securities 

and 
Common 
Securities, 

except 
that 
upon 
certain 

events 
of 
default 
under 

the 
Trust 
Agreement

 relating to payment defaults on Debentures, the rights of the holders of the
Common 
Securities to payment in respect 
 of distributions and payments upon
liquidation, redemption and 
otherwise are subordinated to the rights of 
the holders

 of the Capital Securities.

 In the 
case of 
any
event 
of default 
under the 
Trust
Agreement 
resulting from 
an event 
of
default 
under the 
 Indenture,
the 
Company, 
as holder 
of
the 
Common Securities, 
will be 
deemed
to 
have waived 
any right 
to
act 
with 
 respect to
any 
such event of default 
under the Trust Agreement until 
all such
events 
of default have been 
cured, waived

 or otherwise eliminated. Until 
all events
of 
default under the 
Trust Agreement have been 
so cured,
waived 
or otherwise

 eliminated, 
the 

Property 
Trustee 
will 

act 
solely 
on 
behalf 

of 
the 
holders 
of 

the 
Capital 
Securities 

and 
not 
on 
the

 Company s behalf, 
and only the
holders 
of the Capital Securities 
will have the right 
to direct the
Property 
Trustee to 
 act on their behalf.

 Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution

 The amount 
payable on 
the
Capital 
Securities in 
the event 
of
any 
liquidation of 
the Trust 
is
the 
liquidation 
 amount
of 
 25 per 
Capital Security 
plus
accumulated 
but unpaid 
distributions, subject 
to
certain 
exceptions, which 
 may be paid in the form of a distribution of Debentures.

 The Company can at any time dissolve the Trust. If the Trust 
dissolves and it has
paid the liabilities owed to 
 its creditors, the Debentures will be distributed to the holders of the
Trust 
Securities. 
 Any distributions of the Debentures may require approval of the
Federal 
Reserve. 
 The Trust Agreement states that the
Trust 
will dissolve automatically on December 1, 2035 or earlier upon:

 (1)
 the bankruptcy,
dissolution 
or liquidation of the Company 

 (2)
 the 

distribution 
of 
Debentures 

having 
a 
principal 

amount 
equal 
to 
the 

liquidation 
amount 
of 

the 
Trust 
 Securities of the holders to whom the Debentures are distributed,
if the Company has given written direction 
 to the Property Trustee to dissolve
the 
Trust, which direction, subject to the foregoing restrictions, 
is optional

 and wholly within the discretion of the Company 

9

 (3)
 the redemption of all
Capital Securities in connection with the redemption of all the Debentures or the stated 
 maturity of the Debentures or

 (4)
 the entry of an order
for the dissolution of the Trust 
by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 If
the 
Trust 
dissolves as 
described
in 
clauses (1), 
(2) or 
(4)
in 
the preceding 
paragraph, after 
the
Trust 
pays all 
 amounts owed to
creditors, 
holders of the Capital Securities 
and holders of its Common 
Securities
will be entitled to 
 receive Debentures having a principal amount equal to the
liquidation 
amount of the Trust Securities of the holders. 
 If the Trust cannot
pay the full amount due 
on the Trust Securities because it has insufficient 
assets for payment,

 then the amounts the Trust 
owes on the Capital Securities
will 
be proportionately allocated. The 
holders of Common

 Securities are entitled to receive 
distributions upon any
liquidation 
on a pro rata basis 
with the holders of the 
Capital

 Securities, except 
that
if 
an event 
of default 
under
the 
Debentures has 
occurred and 
is
continuing 
as a 
result of 
any

 failure by the Company to make any principal or interest payments 
in respect of
Debentures when due, the Trust will 
 pay the total amounts due on the Capital Securities before making any
distribution 
on the Common Securities. 
 After the liquidation date is fixed for
any distribution of Debentures, upon dissolution 
the Trust:

the Trust Securities
will no longer be deemed to be outstanding 

DTC 

or 
its 
nominee, 
as 

the 
registered 
holder 

of 
the 
Capital 

Securities, 
will 
receive 

a 
registered 
global

 certificate 
or
certificates 
representing the 
Debentures to 
be
delivered 
upon distribution 
with respect 
to the

 Capital Securities held by DTC or its nominee and

any 

certificates 
representing 
the
Capital 
Securities 
will 
be 

deemed 
to 
represent 

the 
Debentures 
having 
an

 aggregate principal amount equal to the 
liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities, 
and bearing accrued but 
 unpaid interest equal to
accumulated 
but unpaid distributions on Capital 
Securities, until the holder
of 
those 
 certificates presents them to the security registrar for Capital
Securities for transfer 
or reissuance. 
 Exchanges

 If 
at 

any 
time 
a 
Depositor 

Affiliated 
Owner 
is 

the 
owner 
of 
Capital 

Securities, 
such 
Depositor 
Affiliated

 Owner will have the right to deliver to the Property Trustee all or such portion of its Capital Securities as it elects and

 receive, 
in 

exchange 
therefore, 
a 

like 
amount 
of 

Debentures. 
After 
the 

exchange, 
the 
Capital 

Securities 
will 
be

 cancelled and will no longer 
be deemed to
be 
outstanding and all rights of 
the Depositor Affiliated Owner with 
respect

 to the Capital Securities will cease.

 In the case of an exchange described in the previous paragraph, the Trust will, on the date of such exchange,

 exchange Debentures having 
a principal
amount 
equal to a proportional 
amount of the 
aggregate liquidation amount

 of its outstanding Common Securities, based on the ratio of the aggregate
liquidation 
amount of its Capital Securities 
 exchanged divided by the
aggregate 
liquidation amount of its Capital 
Securities outstanding immediately prior to such

 exchange, for 
such proportional
amount 
of its Common 
Securities held by 
the Company
(which 
contemporaneously 
 will be cancelled and no longer be deemed to be
outstanding). 
 Events of Default; Notice

 Any one of the following events constitutes an event of default 
of the Trust,
regardless of the reason for such 
 event of default and whether 
it will be
voluntary or involuntary 
or be effected by operation 
of law or pursuant to any

 judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, 
rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body:

the occurrence of an
event of default under the Indenture with 
respect to the Debentures held by the Trust or 

10

the default by
the 
Property Trustee in 
the payment of any 
distribution on the
Capital 
Securities or Common 
 Securities when such distribution becomes due and
payable, and 
continuation of such default for a period of 
 30 days or

the default by the
Property Trustee in the payment of any redemption price of Capital Securities or Common 
 Securities when such redemption price becomes due
and payable or

the failure to
perform or the breach, in any material respect, 
of any other covenant or warranty of the trustees

 of the Trust in 
the Trust
Agreement 
for 90 days after the defaulting 
trustee or trustees have
received 
written 
 notice of the failure to
perform 
or breach of warranty in the manner specified in the Trust 
Agreement or

the
occurrence 
of certain 
events
of 
bankruptcy 
or insolvency 
with
respect 
to the 
Property Trustee 
and the

 Company s failure to appoint a successor 
property trustee within 90 days.

 Within ten days after any event 
of default of the Trust
actually 
known to the Property Trustee occurs, the 
Property

 Trustee will transmit notice of such event of default to 
the holders of the Capital
Securities or Common Securities 
and

 to 
the 

Administrative 
Trustees, 
unless 

such 
event 
of 
default 

shall 
have 
been 
cured 

or 
waived. 
The 

Company, 
as

 depositor, 
and
the 
Administrative Trustees 
are required 
to
file 
annually with 
the
Property 
Trustee 
a certificate 
as to

 whether or not 
the Company
or 
the Administrative Trustees 
are in compliance 
with all the
conditions 
and covenants 
 applicable to the Company and the Administrative
Trustees 
under the Trust Agreement. 
 The
existence 
of an event 
of default under 
the
Trust 
Agreement, in and 
of itself, with 
respect to
the 
Debentures 
 does not entitle the holders of the Capital Securities to accelerate
the maturity of 
the Debentures. 
 Removal of Trustees

 Unless an event 
of default under
the 
Indenture has occurred 
and is continuing, 
the Property
Trustee 
and the 
 Delaware Trustee may be removed at any time by the holder of the
Common Securities. The Property Trustee and the

 Delaware 
Trustee 

may 
be 
removed 
by 

the 
holders 
of 
a 

majority 
in 
liquidation 

amount 
of 
the 

outstanding 
Capital 
 Securities for
cause 
or if an event 
of default under the 
Indenture has
occurred 
and is continuing. In 
no event will the

 holders 
of
the 
Capital 
Securities
have 
the 
right 
to
vote 
to 
appoint, 
remove 

or replace 
the Administrative 
Trustees,

 which voting 
rights are
vested 
exclusively in the 
Company, 
as the
holder 
of the Common 
Securities. No resignation

 or removal of a trustee and 
no appointment of a successor trustee
will 
be effective until the acceptance of appointment 
 by the successor trustee in
accordance with the provisions of the Trust 
Agreement.

 Co-Trustees and Separate 
Property Trustee

 Unless an event of default under 
the Debentures has occurred
and 
is continuing, at any time or 
from time to

 time, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust 
Indenture Act
or of any jurisdiction in which any 
 part of the 
trust property
may 
at the time 
be located,
the 
Company, 
as the holder 
of the
Common 
Securities, and the 
 Administrative Trustees have the power
to 
appoint one or more 
persons either to act 
as a co-trustee
of 
the Trust, jointly 
 with the
Property 
Trustee, of all 
or any part 
of such trust
property, 
or to act as 
separate trustee of 
any such property,

 in either 
case with
such 
powers as 
may be provided 
in
the 
instrument of 
appointment, and 
to vest
in 
such person or 
 persons in such capacity any property, title, right or power
deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the provisions of 
 the Trust 
Agreement.
If an 
event of default 
under the Indenture 
has occurred
and 
is continuing, the Property 
Trustee

 alone shall have power to make such appointment.

 Mergers or Consolidation of Trustees

 Any person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, if not a natural person, may be merged

 or 
converted 

or 
with 
which 
it 

may 
be 
consolidated, 

or 
any 
person 

resulting 
from 
any 

merger, 
conversion 
or

 consolidation to 
which such
trustee 
is a party, 
or any person 
succeeding
to 
all or substantially 
all the corporate 
trust

 business of 
such
trustee, 
will be 
the successor 
of
such 
trustee under 
the Trust 
Agreement,
provided 
such person 
is

 otherwise qualified and eligible. 

11

 Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of the Trusts

 The Trust 
may
not 
merge 
with or 
into,
consolidate, 
amalgamate, or 
be
replaced 
by, 
or convey, 
transfer or

 lease its 
properties

assets 
substantially as 
an entirety 
to
the 
Company or 
any other

 below or as otherwise
described 
in the Trust 
Agreement. The Trust 
may,

consent of 
the
holders 
of the Capital 
Securities, the Property 
Trustee

 or the Delaware Trustee, merge 
with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or
be 
replaced by, or convey, 
transfer or lease

 its properties and assets 
substantially as an
entirety 
to, a trust 
organized as such under the 
laws of

to the

12

 Voting 
Rights; Amendment of the
Trust 
Agreement 
 Except as otherwise provided
below 
and as otherwise required by law 
and the Trust Agreement, 
the holders

 of the Capital Securities have no voting rights.

 The Company and 
the Administrative
Trustees 
may amend the 
Trust Agreement 
without the
consent 
of the

 holders 
of 

the 
Capital 
Securities, 

unless 
such 
amendment 

will 
materially 
and 

adversely 
affect 
the 

interests 
of 
any

 holder of the Capital Securities, to:

cure
any 
ambiguity, 
correct or supplement 
any
provisions 
in the 
Trust Agreement 
that may
be 
inconsistent 
 with any other
provision, 
or to make any other 
provisions with respect to matters 
or questions
arising under 
 the Trust Agreement, which may not be inconsistent 
with the other
provisions of the Trust Agreement 
or

modify, 

eliminate 
or add 
to
any 
provisions 
of
the 
Trust 
Agreement 
to
such 
extent as 
will
be 
necessary 
to

 ensure 
that
the 
Trust 
will be 
classified
for 
United 
States federal 
or
Puerto 
Rico income 
tax purposes 
as a

 grantor trust at all times that any Capital Securities and Common Securities are outstanding or to ensure that

 the Trust will not be required to register as an investment 
company 
under the Investment Company Act. 
 The Company, 
the Administrative
Trustees 
and the Property Trustee 
may generally amend the 
Trust Agreement

 with:

the 

consent 
of 
holders 

representing 
not 
less 

than 
a 
majority, 
based 

upon 
liquidation 
amounts, 

of 
the 
 outstanding Capital Securities and

receipt by
the 
trustees of an 
opinion of counsel 
to the effect
that 
such amendment or the 
exercise of any 
power

 granted to the trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust s status as a grantor trust

 for 
United 

States 
federal 
or 

Puerto 
Rico 
income 
tax 

purposes 
or 
the 

Trust s 
exemption 
from 

status 
as 
an

 investment company under the Investment Company Act.

 However, without the consent of each holder 
of Trust Securities, the
Trust 
Agreement may not be amended to:

change the amount or
timing of any distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a 
 specified date or

restrict the right of a
holder of Trust Securities to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such payment on 
 or after such date.

 So long 
as the 
Property
Trustee 
holds any 
Debentures, the 
trustees
of 
the Trust 
may not, 
without
obtaining 
the 
 prior approval of the holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation
amount 
of all outstanding Capital Securities:

direct 

the 
time, 
method 
and 

place 
of 
conducting 

any 
proceeding 
for 
any 

remedy 
available 
to 

the 
junior 
 subordinated trustee,
or 
executing any trust 
or power conferred 
on the
junior 
subordinated trustee with 
respect

 to the Debentures 

waive any past
default that is waivable under the Indenture 

exercise any right
to rescind 
or annul a declaration that 
the principal of all the 
Debentures is
due and payable 
 or

consent 

to 
any 
amendment, 

modification 
or 
termination 

of 
the 
Indenture 
or 

the 
Debentures, 
where 
such

 consent will be required.

 If a consent under the Indenture 
would require the consent
of 
each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such 
 consent may be given
by 
the Property Trustee without 
the prior consent of each 
holder of the
Capital Securities. The 
 Property Trustee may not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the holders of the
Capital 
 Securities except 
by
subsequent 
vote of 
the holders 
of
the 
Capital Securities. 
The Property 
Trustee
will 
notify each 

13

 holder 
of 

Capital 
Securities 
of 

any 
notice 
of 
default 

with 
respect 
to 
the 

Debentures. 
In 
addition 

to 
obtaining 
the

 foregoing approvals 
of
the 
holders of 
the Capital 
Securities,
before 
taking any 
of the 
foregoing
actions, 
the trustees 
 will obtain an opinion of counsel experienced in
such 
matters to the effect that such action would 
not cause the Trust

 to be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal or Puerto Rico income
tax 
purposes. 
 Any required approval of holders of Capital Securities may be
given at a meeting of holders of Capital Securities 
 convened for such purpose or pursuant to written consent. The Property
Trustee 
will cause a notice of any meeting at 
 which holders of Capital Securities
are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written 
consent of such

 holders is 
to be taken, 
to
be given 
to each holder 
of record of 
Capital
Securities 
in the manner 
set forth 
in the Trust

 Agreement. 
 Notwithstanding
that holders of 
Capital Securities are entitled to 
vote or consent under any
of 
the circumstances 
 described above, any of the Capital Securities that are
owned by the Company or its affiliates or the trustees or any of 
 their affiliates, will, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated
as if they 
were not outstanding. 
 Payment and Paying Agent

 Payments on 
the
Capital 
Securities are made 
to DTC, which 
credits the
applicable 
accounts at DTC 
on the

 applicable distribution dates. If any Capital Securities are not held by DTC, such payments are made by check mailed

 to the address of the holder as such address appears on the register.

 The paying agent 
for the
Trust 
is Banco Popular 
de Puerto Rico. The 
paying agent
is 
permitted to resign 
as

 paying agent of the Trust 
upon 30 days written
notice 
to the Administrative Trustees 
and to the Property Trustee. 
In

 the event 
that
Banco 
Popular de 
Puerto Rico 
is
no 
longer be 
the paying 
agent,
the 
Property Trustee 
will appoint 
a

 successor to act as paying agent, which will be a 
bank or trust company
acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and 
 to the Company.

 Registrar and Transfer 
Agent

 Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Trust Division acts as registrar 
and transfer agent
for the Capital Securities. 
 Registrations of 
transfers of
Capital 
Securities are effected 
without charge 
by or
on 
behalf of the 
Trust, but

 upon 
payment 

of 
any 
tax 
or 

other 
governmental 
charges 

that 
may 
be 
imposed 

in 
connection 
with 
any 

transfer 
or 
 exchange. The Trust
is 
not required to register or cause to be 
registered the transfer of the Capital
Securities 
after the 
 Capital Securities have been called for redemption.

 Information Concerning the Property Trustee

 Other 
than 

during 
the 
occurrence 

and 
continuance 
of 
an 

event 
of 
default 
under 

the 
Trust 
Agreement, 
the

 Property Trustee undertakes to perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the
Trust 
Agreement. After an 
 event of default under the Trust Agreement, the Property
Trustee 
must exercise the same degree of care and skill as a 
 prudent individual would
exercise 
or use in 
the conduct of 
his or
her 
own affairs. Subject to 
this provision, the 
Property

 Trustee is under no obligation to exercise 
any of the powers vested in it by the
Trust 
Agreement at the request of any

 holder 
of 

the 
Capital 
Securities 

unless 
it 
is 
offered 

indemnity 
satisfactory 
to 

it 
by 
such 
holder 

against 
the 
costs,

 expenses and liabilities 
that might
be 
incurred. If no event 
of default under 
the Trust
Agreement 
has occurred and 
is

 continuing and the 
Property
Trustee 
is required to 
decide between alternative 
courses of
action, 
construe ambiguous 
 provisions the Trust Agreement or
is 
unsure of the application 
of any provision of 
the Trust Agreement, and
the 
matter

 is 
not 

one 
upon 
which 
holders 

of 
the 
Capital 

Securities 
are 
entitled 

under 
the 
Trust 

Agreement 
to 
vote, 
then 

the

 Property 
Trustee 

will 
take 
any 
action 

that 
the 
Company 

directs. 
If 
the 

Company 
does 
not 

provide 
direction, 
the

 Property 
Trustee 

may 
take 
any 
action 

that 
it
deems 
advisable 
and 
in 

the 
best 
interests 
of 

the 
holders 
of 
the 

Trust 
 Securities and will have no liability except for its own bad faith,
negligence 
or willful misconduct. 
 The Company
and 
its affiliates maintain 
certain accounts and 
other banking
relationships 
with the Property 
 Trustee and its affiliates in the
ordinary 
course of business.

the Trust in

Rico

 funds
available 
for such 
payments. If 
the
Company 
does not make 
interest payments 
on the

the

 Trust, the Trust will 
not pay
distributions 
on the Capital 
Securities and will 
not have
funds 
available for such 
payments.

 See Status of the Guarantee . Because the Company is a holding company, the Company s rights to participate in

reorganization is 
subject
to

 prior claims
of 
the subsidiary s creditors except to 
the extent that 
the Company
may 
itself be a 
creditor with recognized

 claims against the 
subsidiary. Except as otherwise
described 
in this exhibit, 
the Guarantee does 
not limit
the 
incurrence 
 or issuance by the Company of other secured or unsecured debt.

 The Guarantee, 
when
taken 
together with 
the
Company s 
obligations 
under
the 
Debentures, 
the Indenture

 and 
the 

Trust 
Agreement, 
including 

the 
Company s 
obligations 

to 
pay 
costs, 

expenses, 
debts 
and 

liabilities 
of 
the 

15 
 Trust, other
than 
those relating 
to Capital 
Securities or
Common 
Securities, provides a 
full and 
unconditional guarantee

 on a subordinated basis of payments due on the Capital Securities issued by the Trust.

 Under the 
Guarantee
Agreement, 
the Company 
irrevocably and 
unconditionally
agrees 
to pay in 
full to the

 holders of 
the
Trust 
Securities, except 
to the 
extent
paid 
by the 
Trust,

may have or assert, the
Guarantee Payments without duplication:

any accrued
and 
unpaid distributions that 
are required to 
be paid
on 
the Capital Securities, 
to the extent 
the

 Trust has funds available for distributions 

the
redemption 
price, plus 
all accrued 
and
unpaid 
distributions relating 
to any 
Capital
Securities 
called for 
 redemption by the Trust, to the extent the
Trust 
has funds available for redemptions and

upon a voluntary
or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the 
Trust, other than in connection

 with the distribution of Debentures to the holders of Capital Securities or the
redemption 
of all of its Capital 
 Securities, the lesser of:

the aggregate of
the liquidation 
amount and all accrued and unpaid 
distributions on the Capital
Securities 
to 
 the date of payment to the extent the Trust has funds
available 
and

the amount of
assets of 
the Trust remaining 
for distribution to holders of 
Capital
Securities in liquidation of 
 the Trust.

 Status of the Guarantee

 The Guarantee is unsecured and ranks:

subordinate
and 
junior in right 
of payment 
to all
the 
Company s 
other liabilities in 
the
same 
manner as 
the

 Debentures as set forth in the Indenture and

equally with all
other Guarantees that the Company issues. 
 The Guarantee 
constitutes a
guarantee 
of payment and 
not of collection, 
which means
that 
the guaranteed party 
 may sue
the 
guarantor to enforce 
its rights 
under the
Guarantee 
without suing any 
other person or 
entity. The Guarantee

 is held by the guarantee trustee for the benefit of the 
holders of the Trust
Securities. The Guarantee will be discharged 
 only 
by
payment 
of the 
Guarantee Payments 
in
full 
to the 
extent 
not
paid 
by the 
Trust 
or
upon 
the distribution 
of

 Debentures.

 Amendments and Assignment

 The Guarantee 
may
be 
amended only 
with the 
prior
approval 
of the 
holders of 
not
less 
than a 
majority in

 aggregate liquidation amount of the outstanding Capital Securities. 
No vote is
required, however, for any changes that

 do 
not 

adversely 
affect 
the 

rights 
of 
holders 
of 

the 
Capital 
Securities 
in 

any 
material 
respect. 
All 

guarantees 
and

 agreements 
contained 

in 
the 
Guarantee 
bind 

the 
Company s 
successors, 

assignees, 
receivers, 
trustees 
and

 representatives and will be for the benefit of the holders of the Capital Securities
then 
outstanding.

 Termination 
of the Guarantee

 The Guarantee will 
terminate (1) upon
full 
payment of the 
redemption price of all 
Capital Securities, (2) upon

 distribution of the 
Debentures to the
holders 
of the Trust 
Securities or (3) upon 
full payment of
the 
amounts payable 
 in accordance with the Trust Agreement
upon 
liquidation of the Trust. The Guarantee will continue 
to be effective or

 will be reinstated, as the 
case may be, if
at 
any time any holder of 
Capital Securities must restore payment of 
any sums

 paid under the Capital Securities or the Guarantee.

 Events of Default 

16 
 Under the
Guarantee, an event of default will occur if the Company fails to perform 
any payment obligation

 or other obligation under the Guarantee.

 the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
guarantee 
 trustee or to 
direct the
exercise 
of any trust 
or power conferred 
upon the
guarantee 
trustee under the 
Guarantee. Holders

 of 
the 

Capital 
Securities 
may 

institute 
a 
legal 

proceeding 
directly 
against 

the 
Company 
to 
enforce 

the 
guarantee 
 trustee s rights and the Company s obligations
under the Guarantee, 
without first instituting a 
legal proceeding against

 the Trust, the guarantee trustee or any other person 
or entity.

 As 
guarantor 

under 
the 
Guarantee, 
the 

Company 
is 
required 
to 

file 
annually 
with 
the 

guarantee 
a 
trustee

 certificate pursuant to the Guarantee, 
as to whether
or 
not the Company is 
in compliance with all 
applicable conditions

 and covenants under the Guarantee.

of
an 
event of 
default relating 
to
the 
Guarantee, the 
 guarantee trustee is
required 
to perform only the duties 
that are specifically set forth 
in the
Guarantee. Following 
the 
 occurrence of
an 
event of default, the 
guarantee trustee will exercise 
the same
degree 
of care as a 
prudent individual

 would exercise in the 
conduct of his or
her 
own affairs. Provided that 
the foregoing requirements have 
been met, the

 guarantee trustee 
is under
no 
obligation to 
exercise any of 
the powers
vested 
in it by 
the Guarantee at 
the request of

 any holder 
of
Capital 
Securities unless 
offered indemnity 
satisfactory
to 
it against the 
costs, expenses 
and liabilities

 which might be incurred thereby.

 The Company and its affiliates maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the guarantee

 trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

 General

 The 
Debentures 

are 
unsecured, 
junior 

subordinated 
obligations 
of 

the 
Company. 
The 

Debentures 
are 
limited 
in

 aggregate principal amount to 134,021,000. The 
aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures is limited to the 
sum 
 of:

the aggregate
stated liquidation amount of the Capital Securities and

the amount of
capital contributed by the Company in exchange for the Common Securities. 
 The Debentures ranks junior to the Company s senior debt,
including the subordinated debt of the Company. 
For 
 information on the
subordination of the Debentures, see Description of 
the Debentures Subordination .

 The entire principal amount of 
the Debentures will become
due 
and payable, with any accrued 
and unpaid interest

 thereon, on December 1, 2034. There is no sinking fund for the Debentures. 

17 
 The
Company 
does not 
pay any 
additional
amounts 
on the 
Debentures to 
compensate
any 
holder or 
beneficial

 owner for any Puerto Rico tax withheld from payments of principal or interest 
on
the Debentures. 
 The Debentures are registered in the name 
of the Trust. The
Property Trustee holds the Debentures in trust 
for the 
 benefit of the holders of
the Trust Securities. 
 Interest

 The Debentures bear interest 
at an annual rate
of 
6.125 ,from and including their 
date of issuance until the

 principal becomes 
due and
payable. 
Interest is payable 
monthly in arrears 
on the
first 
day of each 
month, beginning

 January 1, 
2005.
Interest 
payments not 
paid when 
due
accrue, 
to the 
extent permitted 
by
applicable 
law, 
additional

 interest, compounded 
monthly,
at 
the annual rate 
of 6.125 , computed 
on the
basis 
of a 360-day 
year of twelve 
30-

 day months and the actual number of days elapsed in a partial month in such period.

 The Company 
pays
interest 
on the 
Debentures to 
the
holders 
of record 
on the 
applicable
record 
date. The 
 record
date 
for interest 
payments on 
the
Debentures 
is the 
fifteenth 
day
of 
the month 
preceding
the 
payment 
date,

 whether or not a business day.

 The amount 
of
interest 
payable for 
any period 
less
than 
a full interest 
period is 
computed
on 
the basis of 
a

 360-day year 
of
twelve 
30-day months 
and the 
actual days
elapsed 
in a partial 
month in 
that
period. 
The amount 
of

 interest payable for any full interest period is computed by dividing the 
annual
rate by twelve. 
 If any date on which interest is payable on the Debentures is not a business day, then payment of the interest

 payable 
on that 
date
will 
be made 
on the 
next
succeeding 
day 
that is 
a
business 
day, 
without 
any
interest 
or other 
 payment
in 
respect of 
the delay, 
with
the 
same force 
and effect 
as
if 
made on 
the date 
that
payment 
was originally 
 payable.

 The amount of additional interest payable for any full interest period is 
computed
by dividing the annual rate 
 by twelve. 
The
term 
 interest as 
used in 
this
description 
includes 
monthly 
interest
payments, 
interest on 
monthly

 interest payments not 
paid when
due, 
compounded interest and 
additional sums, as 
applicable. The
interest 
payment 
 provisions for the Debentures correspond to the distribution
provisions for the Capital Securities. See Description of 
 the Capital Securities Payment of Distributions in this
description. 
 Option to Extend Interest Payment Period

 As long as the 
Company is not in
default 
under the Debentures, the 
Company has the right, 
at any time and

 from time to time, to 
defer payments of
interest 
during an Extension Period, 
of up to 60 consecutive 
months, but not

 beyond the maturity 
date of the
Debentures. 
During an Extension 
Period, interest continues 
to accrue
and 
holders of 
 the
Debentures, 
or holders 
of Capital 
Securities
using 
the accrual 
method of 
accounting
to 
determine 
their taxable

 income, are required to accrue interest income for Puerto Rico income tax purposes.

 On the interest 
payment date
following 
the last day of 
any Extension Period, 
the Company
pays 
all interest 
 then accrued and unpaid, together with additional
interest 
on the accrued and unpaid interest 
to the extent as permitted

 by law, compounded monthly, 
at the annual rate of 6.125 , plus any additional
sums, as described below. 
 Before termination of an 
Extension Period
for 
the Debentures, the 
Company may further 
extend the payments

 of interest. However, 
no Extension Period, including
all 
previous and further extensions, may 
exceed 60 consecutive

 months or extend beyond 
the maturity of the
Debentures. 
If any Debentures are called 
for redemption before the end

 of an Extension Period relating 
to the Debentures,
such 
Extension Period will end 
on that redemption date 
or an earlier

 date as determined by the Company. After the termination of an Extension Period
for 
the Debentures and the payment 
 of
all 
amounts due, 
the Company 
may
begin 
a new 
Extension Period, 
as
described 
above. There 
is no 
limitation on

 the number of times the 
Company may elect to
begin 
an Extension Period for the 
Debentures. Interest is not payable

 during 
an 

Extension 
Period 
for 

the 
Debentures, 
only 

at 
the 
end 
of 

the 
Extension 
Period 

for 
the 
Debentures. 
The

 Company may, 
however,
prepay, 
on any interest 
payment date, at 
any time
all 
or any portion 
of the interest 
accrued

 during an Extension Period for the Debentures. 

18 
 If the Property
Trustee is the sole holder of the Debentures, the Company 
will give the Property Trustee and

 the Delaware Trustee written notice of its election of an Extension Period for the
Debentures 
at least one business day 
 before the earlier of:

the next
succeeding date on which the distributions on the Capital Securities are payable 
and

the
date 
the Property 
Trustee is 
required
to 
give notice 
to holders 
of
the 
Capital Securities 
of the 
record or

 payment date for the applicable distribution.

 The Property Trustee will give notice of the Company s election of an Extension Period for the Debentures to the

 holders of the Capital Securities.

 With 
respect 

to 
either 
Trust, 
if 

the 
Property 
Trustee 

is 
not 
the 
sole 

holder, 
or 
is 
not 

itself 
the 
holder, 
of 

the 
 Debentures, the Company 
will
give 
the holders of 
the Debentures and 
the indenture
trustee 
written notice of 
its election

 of 
an 

Extension 
Period 
for 
the 

Debentures 
at 
least 
one 

business 
day 
before 
the 

next 
interest 
payment 

date 
for 
the

 Debentures.

 Additional Sums

 If, at 
any time 
while
the 
Property Trustee 
is the 
holder
of 
the Debentures, 
the Trust 
is
required 
to pay 
any

 additional taxes (other 
than withholding taxes),
duties 
or other governmental 
charges as a result 
of a
Tax 
Event with 
 respect
to 
the Trust, 
the Company 
will
pay 
as additional 
interest on 
the
Debentures 
any additional 
amounts that 
are

 required 
so 

that 
the 
distributions 

paid 
by the 
Trust 
will
not 
be 
reduced 
as
a 
result 
of any 
of 
those
taxes, 
duties 
or

 governmental charges.

 Redemption

 The Company 
has
the 
right, 
subject
to 
any 
required 
prior 

approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve,
to 
redeem 
the 
 Debentures
at a redemption price equal to 100 
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest to the date

 of redemption:

on or after
December 1, 2009, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, 
at any time and

in 

whole, 
but not 
in
part,

any 
time
within 
90 days 
following 
the
occurrence 
and 
continuation 
of
a 
Tax 
 Event, an Investment Company Event or a Capital
Treatment 
Event, each as described above. 
 Notice of
any 
redemption will be 
mailed at least 45 
days but
not 
more than 75 days 
before the redemption 
date.

 Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, 
on and after the
redemption date, interest will 
cease 
 to accrue on the
Debentures 
or portions thereof called for 
redemption. The Debentures are
not 
subject to any sinking 
 fund and are not redeemable at the option of the
holder. 
 Restrictions on Certain Payments Certain Covenants of the Company

making 
payments on the Debentures

 and 
that 

remains 
unclaimed 
two 

years 
after 
the 
payments 

were 
due 
under 
the 

Debentures, 
will, 
at 

the 
Company s 
 request, be
returned

after that time any

registered 
the
Debentures 
in 
the 
name 

of 
the
Property 
Trustee 
on 
behalf
of 
the 
Trust. 
The

 Property Trustee 
holds the
Debentures 
in trust for 
the benefit of 
the
holders 
of the Trust 
Securities. The 
Debentures

 are issued in denominations of 1,000 and integral multiples of 1,000.

 DTC acts as securities depositary for the Debentures.

 With respect to the Debentures, if the Debentures are in certificated form, payments of principal and interest

 will be 
payable,
the 
transfer of 
the Debentures 
will
be 
registrable, and 
the Debentures 
will
be 
exchangeable for 
the

 Debentures of other authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal amount. In such case, payment of interest

 may also be made at the option of the Company by 
check mailed to the address of
the holder entitled to the payment. 
 Upon written request to the paying agent not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date on
which 
interest is payable, 
 a
holder 
of 1,000,000 
or more 
in

may 
receive payment 
of interest,

 other than payments of interest payable at maturity, 
by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. 
 The Debentures may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange with an endorsed
form 
of transfer, 
 or a duly executed and satisfactory written instrument of
transfer, at the security registrar s 
office in San Juan, Puerto 
 Rico
or 
the office 
of any 
transfer
agent 
selected by 
the Company 
without
service 
charge and 
upon payment 
of any

 taxes and other 
governmental
charges 
as described 
in the Indenture. 
The Company
has 
appointed Banco 
Popular de

 Puerto 
Rico 
as
transfer 
agent 
and 
security 

registrar 
under 
the Indenture. 
The
Company 
may 
at 
any 
time
designate 
 additional transfer agents with respect to the Debentures.

 With respect 
to the
Debentures, 
in the event 
of any 
redemption,
the 
Company and 
the indenture 
trustee for

 the Debentures will not be required to:

issue, register
the transfer of or exchange the 
Debentures during a period beginning 15 calendar days 
before

 the first mailing of the notice of redemption or

register

transfer of 
or exchange 
the
Debentures 
selected for 
redemption, except, 
in
the 
case of 
any the

 Debentures being redeemed in part, any portion not to be redeemed.

 At 
the 

request 
of 
the 

Company, 
funds 
deposited 

with 
the 
indenture 

trustee 
or 
any 
paying 

agent 
held 
for 
the

 Company for the payment 
of principal, interest, and
premium, 
if any, 
on any Debenture which remain 
unclaimed for

 two years 
after
the 
principal, interest, 
and premium, 
if
any, 
has become 
payable will 
be
repaid 
to the 
Company and

 the holder of the Debentures will, as a general unsecured creditor, 
look only to
the Company for payment thereof. 
 Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets

 The Indenture generally 
permit a
consolidation 
or merger between 
the Company and 
another entity. The Indenture

 also permits the sale or transfer by the Company of all or substantially all of its property and
assets. 
Such transactions 
 are permitted if:

the resulting
or 
acquiring entity, 
if other than 
the
Company, 
is organized 
and existing under 
the laws of the

 United States or any state, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and assumes all of

 the Company s responsibilities and liabilities under 
the Indenture,
including the payment of all amounts due 
 on the Debentures and performance of the covenants in the Indenture and

immediately after
the transaction, and giving 
effect to the transaction, no event 
of default under the Indenture

 exists. 
 If the Company
consolidates or merges with or into any other entity or sells or leases all or substantially all of its 
 assets according
to 
the terms and conditions 
of the Indenture, 
the resulting
or 
acquiring entity will be 
substituted for

 the Company in the Indenture with the 
same effect as if it had
been 
an original party to the 
Indenture. As a result, such

 successor entity 
may
exercise 
the Company s 
rights and 
powers
under 
the Indenture, 
in
the 
Company s 
name and,

 except in the case of a lease 
of all or substantially all
of 
the Company s properties, the Company will be released from 
 all the
Company s liabilities and 
obligations under the Indenture and under the Debentures.

a 
default 
in 
respect 

of 
a

 covenant 
or 

provision 
that 
cannot 
be 

modified 
or 
amended 

without 
the 
consent 
of 

the 
holder 
of 
each

 outstanding Debenture and

unless the
default 
is cured, the 
consent of the 
holders of
more 
than 50 in 
aggregate liquidation amount 
of

 the Capital Securities is required to waive any other default. 

22 
 If the
event 
of default under 
the Debentures is 
the failure
of 
the Company to 
make payments of 
principal or interest

 on 
the 

Debentures 
when 
due, 

then 
a 
registered 

holder 
of 
Capital 

Securities 
may 
bring 
a 

legal 
action 
against 
the

 Company directly 
for enforcement
of 
payment to such 
registered holder of 
amounts owed
on 
the Debentures 
with a

 principal amount 
equal
to 
the aggregate 
liquidation amount 
of
such 
registered holder s 
Capital Securities 
(a Direct

 Action ). The Company may not amend the Debentures to 
remove this right to
bring a 
Direct Action without the prior 
 written consent of the registered holders
of all the 
Capital Securities. The Company can offset against 
payments then

 due 
under 

the 
Debentures 
any 

corresponding 
payments 
made 

to 
holders 
of 
Capital 

Securities 
by 
the 

Company 
in 
 connection with a Direct Action.

 The holders of the Capital Securities are not able to exercise directly any remedies available to the holders of the

 Debentures except under the circumstance described in the preceding 
paragraph.

 The Indenture Does Not Restrict the Company s Ability to Take 
Certain
Actions that may Affect the Debentures 
 The Indenture does not contain restrictions on the
Company s 
ability to:

incur, assume or
become liable for any type of debt 
or other obligation 

create liens on
the Company s property 
for any purpose or

pay dividends or
make distributions on the Company s capital stock or repurchase or redeem the Company s 
 capital stock, except as set forth
under Restrictions on Certain Payments 
above. 
 The
Indenture does not 
require the maintenance of 
any financial ratios
or 
specified levels of 
net worth or liquidity.

 In addition, the Indenture does contain 
any provisions which would
require 
the Company to repurchase or redeem 
or

 modify the terms of any of the 
Debentures upon a change of control
or 
other event involving the Company which may 
 adversely affect the
creditworthiness of such debt securities. 
 Subordination

 The Debentures are subordinated to all of the Company s existing
and 
future Senior Debt, as defined below. 
 The Company s Senior
Debt includes 
its senior debt securities and its subordinated debt securities and means:

any of the
Company s 
indebtedness for borrowed or 
purchased money, 
whether or not
evidenced 
by bonds, 
 debt securities, notes or other written instruments,

the
Company s obligations 
under letters of credit,

any
of 
the Company s 
indebtedness or 
other
obligations 
with respect 
to commodity 
contracts,
interest 
rate 
 and
currency 
swap agreements, 
cap, floor 
and
collar 
agreements, currency 
spot and 
forward
contracts, 
and 
 other
similar 
agreements or 
arrangements designed 
to
protect 
against fluctuations 
in currency 
exchange or

 interest rates, and

any 

guarantees, 
endorsements 
(other 

than 
by 
endorsement 
of 

negotiable 
instruments 
for 

collection 
in 
the

 ordinary course 
of
business) 
or other 
similar contingent 
obligations
in 
respect of 
obligations of 
others
of 
a 
 type
described 
above, whether or 
not such obligation 
is classified
as 
a liability on 
a balance sheet 
prepared

 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,

 whether outstanding on the date 
of execution of the
Indenture 
or thereafter incurred, other than 
obligations expressly

 on a parity with or junior to the Debentures. The 
Debentures rank on a parity with
obligations evidenced 
by any debt 
 securities,
and 
guarantees in 
respect of 
those
debt 
securities, initially 
issued to 
any
trust, 
partnership or 
other entity

 affiliated with 
the
Company, 
that is, 
directly
or 
indirectly, 
the Company s 
financing
vehicle 
in connection 
with the

 issuance by such entity of capital securities or other similar securities. 

23 
 If certain events
relating to a bankruptcy, 
insolvency or reorganization of the Company occur, 
the Company

 will first pay all Senior Debt, including any interest accrued after the events occur, in full before the Company makes

 any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, on account of the principal of or interest on

 the Debentures. In such an event, the Company will pay or deliver directly to the holders of Senior Debt any payment

 or distribution 
otherwise
payable 
or deliverable 
to holders 
of the
Debentures. 
The Company 
makes the payments 
to

 the holders of Senior Debt according to priorities existing among those holders until the Company has paid all Senior

 Debt, including accrued interest, in 
full. Notwithstanding the subordination
provisions discussed in 
this paragraph, the 
 Company may make payments or
distributions on the Debentures so 
long as:

the payments or
distributions consist of securities issued by the Company or another company in connection 
 with a plan of reorganization or
readjustment and

payment on those
securities is subordinate to outstanding Senior 
Debt and any securities issued with respect

 to Senior Debt under 
such plan of
reorganization 
or readjustment at least to 
the same extent provided 
in the

 subordination provisions of the Debentures.

 If such 
events
relating 
to a bankruptcy, 
insolvency or 
reorganization
of 
the Company 
occur, 
after
it 
has paid 
in 
 full
all 
amounts owed on 
Senior Debt, the 
holders of
the 
Debentures, together with 
the holders 
of any
of 
the Company s 
 other obligations ranking equal with the Debentures, will
be entitled to receive from the Company s 
remaining assets 
 any principal,
premium or interest due at that time on the Debentures and such other 
obligations before the Company

 makes any 
payment 
or
other 
distribution 
on
account 
of 
any of 
the
Company s 
capital stock 
or obligations 
ranking

 junior to the Debentures. 
 If
the Company violates the Indenture by making a payment or distribution to holders of the Debentures before it 
 has paid all the Senior Debt
in full, then the holders 
of the Debentures will be deemed to have received the payments

 or distributions in trust for the benefit of, and will have to pay or transfer the payments or distributions to, the holders

 of the 
Senior
Debt 
outstanding at 
the time. 
The
payment 
or transfer 
to the 
holders
of 
the Senior 
Debt will 
be made

 according to 
the
priorities 
existing among 
those holders. 
Notwithstanding
the 
subordination provisions 
discussed in

 this paragraph, holders 
of the Debentures
are 
not required to pay, 
or transfer payments 
or distributions to,
holders 
of 
 Senior Debt so long as:

the payments or
distributions consist of securities issued by the Company or another company in connection 
 with a plan of reorganization or
readjustment and

payment on those
securities is subordinate to outstanding Senior 
Debt and any securities issued with respect

 to Senior Debt under 
such plan of
reorganization 
or readjustment at least to 
the same extent provided 
in the

 subordination provisions of those Debentures.

 Because 
of 

the 
subordination, 
if 

the 
Company 
becomes 

insolvent, 
holders 
of 

Senior 
Debt 
may 
receive 

more, 
 ratably, 
and
holders 
of the 
Debentures
may 
receive 
less,
ratably, 
than 
the
Company s 
other 
creditors. 
This
type 
of

 subordination 
will 

not 
prevent 
an 
event 

of 
default 
from 

occurring 
under 
the 

Indenture 
in 
connection 

with 
the 
 Debentures.

 Any modification or amendment 
of the Indenture
may 
not, without the consent 
of the holders of all 
Senior Debt

 outstanding, 
modify 

any 
of 
the 
provisions 

of 
the 
Debentures 

relating 
to 
the 

subordination 
of 
the 

Debentures 
in 
a

 manner that would adversely affect the holders of Senior Debt.

 The Indenture does not place a limitation on the amount of Senior Debt that 
the
Company may incur. 
 Concerning the Indenture Trustee

 The indenture 
trustee
has 
all the 
duties and 
responsibilities
specified 
under the 
Trust 
Indenture
Act. 
Other 
 than its duties in case of a default, the indenture trustee is under
no obligation to exercise any of the powers under the 
 Indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders of Debentures
unless 
offered reasonable indemnification. 

24 
 From time to time,
the Company 
and certain of its subsidiaries maintain 
deposit accounts and conduct other

 banking transactions, including lending transactions, with the indenture 
trustee
in the ordinary course of business. 
 Governing Law

 The Indenture 
and
the 
Debentures are 
governed by, 
and
construed 
in accordance 
with, the 
internal
laws 
of 
 the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
