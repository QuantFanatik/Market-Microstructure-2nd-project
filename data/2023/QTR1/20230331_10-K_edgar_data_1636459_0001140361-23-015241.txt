Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings

Other than as stated in the following paragraphs, no legal proceedings are pending against the Issuing Entity, Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.) Navient Solutions ), as
 the Sponsor, the Servicer and the Administrator, Navient Funding, LLC, as the Depositor (the Depositor and registrant under Registration Statement Number 333-190926 (the Registrant or to the Registrant s knowledge, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
 the Indenture Trustee, or Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as agent for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are or would be material to the holders of the notes issued by the Issuing Entity, nor does the Registrant know of any such proceeding
 contemplated by any governmental authorities.

The following three paragraphs are disclosure received from Navient Solutions, LLC, the servicer for this transaction.

Navient Corporation Navient has been named as defendant in a number of putative class action cases alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws including the
 Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (the CFPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the FDCPA ), in adversarial proceedings under the United States
 Bankruptcy Code, and various state consumer protection laws. At this point in time, Navient is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that these legal proceedings may have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity,
 results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and reserves have not been established. It is
 possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on Navient, Navient Solutions and/or their affiliates or on the financial ability of the depositor, the servicer or a seller to fulfill an obligation to purchase or
 repurchase trust student loans in connection with a breach of representation, warranty or covenant.

1 

In January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB and the Attorneys General for the State of Illinois and the State of Washington initiated civil actions naming Navient and
 several of its subsidiaries (including Navient Solutions) as defendants alleging violations of certain federal and state consumer protection statutes, including the CFPA, the FCRA, the FDCPA and various state consumer protection laws. The Attorneys
 General for the States of Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, and New Jersey also initiated actions against Navient and certain subsidiaries alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws based on similar alleged acts
 or failures to act. In addition to these matters, a number of lawsuits have been filed by nongovernmental parties or, in the future, may be filed by additional governmental or nongovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies related to
 similar issues raised by the CFPB and the State Attorneys General. In January 2022, Navient entered into a series of Consent Judgment and Orders (the Agreements with 40 State Attorneys General to resolve all matters in dispute related to the
 State Attorneys General cases as well as the related investigations, subpoenas, civil investigative demands and inquiries from various other state regulators. These Agreements do not resolve the litigation involving Navient and the CFPB.

Navient believes the allegations in the CFPB suit are false and that they improperly seek to impose penalties on Navient based on new, previously unannounced servicing standards applied
 retroactively against only one servicer. Navient therefore has denied these allegations and are vigorously defending against the allegations in that case. At this point in time, it is reasonably possible that a loss contingency exists; however,
 Navient is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that an adverse ruling in the CFPB case may have on Navient s consolidated financial position, liquidity, results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible
 at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with this matter and reserves have not been established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse
 impact on Navient, Navient Solutions and/or their affiliates or on the financial ability of the depositor, the servicer or a seller to fulfill an obligation to purchase or repurchase trust student loans in connection with a breach of
 representation, warranty or covenant. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on the trust student loans. In either case, the payments on your notes may be adversely affected.

The following three paragraphs are disclosure received from Computershare Trust Company, N.A. CTC ), as agent for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo Bank concerning Wells Fargo Bank s role
 as trustee of certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts.

In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited and certain related entities (collectively, Phoenix Light filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
 alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New
 York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other
 things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards
 of care following alleged events of default. On July 12, 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and entered judgment in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The district court also dismissed certain of the claims asserted by
 Commerzbank AG. Wells Fargo Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal
 II LLC have filed complaints that were consolidated in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation.

In August 2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit Capital Inc. Nomura and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC Natixis filed a total of seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank
 in New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In the
 third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and
 failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis additionally alleges that Wells Fargo Bank failed to perform default oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo Bank entered into an agreement to settle the six actions filed by Nomura,
 and the actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo Bank has asserted counterclaims alleging that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo Bank notice of its representation and warranty breaches.

With respect to each of the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to
 the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the related RMBS trusts.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

 ABS Platform

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for assessing the Company s
 compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform for
 the period as follows:

Sale of Corporate Trust Services Business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to Computershare
 Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ), Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, Computershare ).

Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such transition as it relates to
 the ABS Platform (defined below).

Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ).

Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company was appointed to provide trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent
 services, and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b)
 the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable
 servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (i) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities, and (ii) certain
 transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not
 accepted any appointments to perform trustee, paying agent services, and/or related services, on new ABS transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to Computershare. Appendix

A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period.

Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period : Management has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with
 respect to the ABS Platform transactions for the Period: 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), and 1122(d)(2)(vi) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
 not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period.

With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

2023 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All rights reserved

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the
 Period.

Appendix A-1 

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the ABS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its
 trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the ABS Platform transactions. During the
 Period, for all the ABS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the
 transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities
 performed by Computershare for the ABS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the
 Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

 Computershare Corporate Trust- ABS Platform

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of
 Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
 Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows:

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
 Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems,
 technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale.

For the ABS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee (except Delaware trustee or
 owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, (collectively, the ABS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the
 related ABS Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new ABS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related ABS
 Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall ABS Platform
 transactions. For a significant majority of ABS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related ABS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the ABS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and
 therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have
 determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the ABS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined
 below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the ABS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

Period : As of January 1, 2022
 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ).

Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either directly in
 the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered
 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts
 as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for
 which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as
 constituting the ABS Platform for the Period.

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
 applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable,
 the Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D),
 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
 applicable to the Company s Obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it
 relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such
 reports; (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to make remittances to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements; and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable
 only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction
 agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).

Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi),
 the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the ABS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is
 not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with
 the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criterion.

With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing
 Criteria:

1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based
 on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
 paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period
 with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.

4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s
 compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

 Navient Corporation:

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria, that Navient Solutions, LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set
 forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for its servicing of student loan asset-backed securities transactions that were outstanding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Platform and each such
 asset-backed securities transaction is a Platform Trust) to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi),
 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(x) 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has concluded were not required by the Company under the related transaction agreements for any Platform Trust (the Servicing Criteria). With respect to servicing criteria
 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vii), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), the Company has concluded that such criteria are not applicable under the related transaction
 agreements for the SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2014-A transaction and Goal Structured Solutions Trust 2016-B transaction. Appendix B to Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria identifies the
 individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform for which the Company acted as administrator or sub-administrator, as applicable (collectively, the Administrator) and servicer or sub-servicer, as
 applicable (collectively, the Servicer) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about
 the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to
 obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
 examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
 performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
 procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for
 the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (i) any transactions for which the securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or

Exhibit 34.3 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Audit Committee of Computershare Trust Company, National Association

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of
 Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - ABS Platform that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
 Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee), paying agent services, and/or related services, either
 directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (i) some or all of the issued securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
 delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the issued securities for such ABS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an
 obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the
 securities issued are mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) any ABS transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS
 Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of
 the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect to
 the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the
 relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports; (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s obligation to make remittances to investors in accordance with the
 transaction agreements; and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors
 on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements.

As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing
 criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to
 the vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act ("Interpretation 200.06").
 As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
 applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
 respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06.

Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the ABS Platform.

The Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
 opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
 standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the
 applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as
 we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the ABS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the ABS Platform, and
 determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
 performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
 amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
 examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

In our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for
 the year ended

December 31, 2022 for the ABS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
